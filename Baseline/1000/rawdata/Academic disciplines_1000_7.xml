[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|270px|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], with an [[empty throne]], 2nd century, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the beginning of the serious study of the history of [[Buddhist art]] in the 1890s, the earliest phase, lasting until the 1st century CE, has been described as [[aniconic]]; the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was only represented through symbols such as an [[Hetoimasia|empty throne]],  [[Bodhi]] tree, a riderless horse with a parasol floating above an empty space (at [[Sanchi]]), [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], and the [[dharma wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, opening pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] interaction, in particular in [[Gandhara]], a theory first fully expounded by [[Alfred A. Foucher]], but  criticised from the start by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].  Foucher also accounted for the origins of the aniconic symbols themselves in small souvenirs carried away from the main pilgrimage sites and so becoming recognised and popularized as symbolic of the events associated with the site.  Other explanations were that it was inappropriate to represent one who had attained [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1990, the notion of aniconism in Buddhism was challenged by [[Susan Huntington]], initiating a vigorous debate among specialists that still continues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZCl3DRN3vsC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false note 7 here] for an update on the controversy as of 2007, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Riderless+horse+Buddha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Riderless%20horse%20Buddha&amp;f=false here] for another from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees many early scenes claimed to be aniconic as in fact not depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, but worship of [[cetiya]] (relics) or re-enactments by devotees at the places where these scenes occurred.  Thus the image of the [[empty throne]] shows an actual relic-throne at [[Bodh Gaya]] or elsewhere.  She points out that there is only one indirect reference for a specific aniconic doctrine in Buddhism to be found, and that pertaining to only one sect.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the archeological evidence, it shows some anthropomorphic sculptures of the Buddha actually existing during the supposedly aniconic period, which ended during the 1st century CE.  Huntington also rejects the association of "aniconic" and "iconic" art with an emerging division between [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.  Huntington's views have been challenged by Vidya Dehejia and others.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some earlier examples have been found in recent years, it is common ground that the large free-standing iconic images of the Buddha so prominent in later Buddhist art are not found in the earliest period; discussion is focused on smaller figures in [[relief]] panels, conventionally considered to represent scenes from the life of the Buddha, and now re-interpreted by Huntington and her supporters.

== Later periods ==
In later periods both the major schools of Buddhism have made great use of representational art, though [[Theravada]] temples and other sites typically concentrate on a single large sculpture of the Buddha, whereas [[Mahayana]] temples have larger numbers of images of a greater variety of figures with varying degrees of spiritual significance.  However some schools, such as [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], have also shown a general tendency towards aniconism, though without specific prohibition of figurative images.

[[File:The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|450px|The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and the [[hierarchy of the sciences|hierarchy of the sciences]].]]

The '''branches of science''', also referred to as [[Science|sciences]], "scientific fields", or "scientific disciplines," are commonly divided into three major groups:

*'''[[Formal science|Formal sciences]]''': the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[fact]]ual, [[methodology]].
*'''[[Natural science]]s''': the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, chemical, and biological factors of the universe)
*'''[[Social science]]s''': the study of [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Social science|Social Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}

Natural and social sciences are [[empirical]] sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions.
{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} This verifiability may well vary even ''within'' a scientific discipline &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Davide Castelvecchi, Nature Magazine | date=2015-12-23 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/ | title=Is String Theory science? | publisher=Scientific American | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=2016-03-03 | url=https://www.nature.com/news/psychology-s-reproducibility-problem-is-exaggerated-say-psychologists-1.19498 | title=Psychology's reproducibility problem | publisher=Nature | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural, social, and formal science make up the [[fundamental science]]s, which form the basis of [[interdisciplinary]] and applied sciences such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.&lt;ref&gt;see: {{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Natural/Pure Science ==
{{Main article|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

Natural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].

=== Physical science ===
{{Main article|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}

Physical science is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.

==== Physics ====
{{Main article|Physics|Outline of physics}}

''Physics''(from {{lang-grc|φύσις|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]&lt;ref name = "feynman"&gt;
[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.

==== Chemistry ====
{{Main article|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}

''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed)&lt;ref&gt;'''See:''' [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]).

==== Earth science ====
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of earth science}}

''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.

===== Ecology=====
{{Main article|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}

Ecology (from Greek: οἶκος, "house"; -λογία, "study of") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].

===== Oceanography =====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}

Oceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that study of the ocean . It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux|fluxes]] of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].

===== Geology =====
{{Main article|Geology|Outline of geology}}

Geology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γῆ, gê, "earth" and λόγος, [[logos]], "study") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.

===== Meteorology=====
{{Main article|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}

Meteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.

==== Space Science or Astronomy ====
{{Main article|Space Science|Outline of space science}}

Space science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science – definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) – NASA Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).

=== Life science ===
{{Main article|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}

''Life science'' comprises the branches of science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a clearly biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of life science, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.

==== Biology ====
{{Main article|Biology|Outline of biology}}

''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.

===== Zoology =====
{{Main article|Zoology|Outline of zoology}} 

Zoology, occasionally spelled zoölogy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον (zōon, "animal") + λόγος (logos, "knowledge"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].

=====Human biology=====
{{main article|Human biology}}
Human biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.

Some branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].

===== Botany=====
{{Main article|Botany|Outline of botany}}

Botany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.
The term "botany" comes from Greek βοτάνη, meaning "pasture, grass, fodder", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.

== Social sciences ==
{{Main article|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}

The ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. "Social science" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] to refer to a plurality of fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[education]], [[government]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), [[public health]], [[ theology]], [[sociology]] and, in some contexts, [[geography]], [[history]] and [[law]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East-European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''formal sciences'' are the branches of science that are concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], [[statistics]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].

Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of [[Scientific theory|theories]] based on [[observation]]s in the [[Reality|real world]] ([[empirical knowledge]]), but rather with the properties of [[formal system]]s based on [[definition]]s and [[Rule of inference|rule]]s. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of [[scientific model]]s dealing with observable reality,{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79&amp;ndash;82}} and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

=== Decision theory ===
{{Main article|Decision theory}}

''Decision theory'' in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game law.

=== Logic ===
{{Main article|Logic|Outline of logic}}

''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:λογική|λογική]]'' logikē)&lt;ref&gt;"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", also related to ''[[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]]'' (logos), "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle" (Liddell &amp; Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].&lt;ref name=stanford-logic-onthology&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | chapterurl = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Logic is also studied in [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = J. Robert | editor1-last = Cox | editor2-first = Charles Arthur | editor2-last = Willard | editor2-link = Charles Arthur Willard | title = Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research | publisher = [[Southern Illinois University Press]] | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-8093-1050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{Main article|Mathematics|Outline of mathematics}}

''Mathematics'', first of all known as The Science of numbers which is classified in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB Marcus Tomalin (2006) ''Linguistics and the Formal Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedikt Löwe]] (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20117289 "The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity"]&lt;/ref&gt; has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}

=== Statistics ===
{{Main article|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}

''Statistics'' is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of [[data]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=statistics The Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

A [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

The word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose plural is ''statistics'' ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").

=== Systems theory ===
{{Main article|Systems theory}}

''Systems theory'' is the [[Interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from [[Ludwig con Albertan|Bernays]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GS) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Alcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Nickolas McLuhan]].

In this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate.

=== Theoretical computer science ===
{{Main article|Theoretical computer science}}

''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.

These divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.

== Applied sciences==
{{Main article|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}

''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.

Applied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.

Example fields of applied science include
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Applied physics]]
* [[Medicine]]
* [[Computer science]]

Fields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27818">'''Cognitive ecology of religion''' is an integrative approach to studying how [[Religion|religious beliefs]] covary with social and natural dynamics of the environment.

This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted.

Furthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked,&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For religion, behaviors often take the form of [[ritual]]s and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs. Because the religious beliefs distributed in a population are relevant to their behavioral strategies and fine-tuned by natural selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codding|first1=Brian F.|last2=Bird|first2=Douglas W.|title=Behavioral ecology and the future of archaeological science|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=April 2015|volume=56|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronk|first1=Lee|title=Human Behavioral Ecology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25; 53|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.20.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; cross-cultural representations of gods and their characteristics are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.&lt;ref name="botero"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botero|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Gardner|first2=Beth|last3=Kirby|first3=Kathryn R.|last4=Bulbulia|first4=Joseph|last5=Gavin|first5=Michael C.|last6=Gray|first6=Russell D.|title=The ecology of religious beliefs|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 November 2014|volume=111|issue=47|pages=16784–16789|doi=10.1073/pnas.1408701111|pmc=4250141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, religious beliefs are thought to frequently involve solutions, insofar as evolved cognitive equipment can build them, to social and natural environmental problems faced by a given population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-262-56025-9|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].&lt;ref name=":norenbuss" /&gt; Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=04|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=026252225X|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt;

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D. M.|title=Blaming God for Our Pain: Human Suffering and the Divine Mind|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=19 November 2009|volume=14|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1177/1088868309350299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin L.|title=Why would anyone believe in God?|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Lanham, MD [u.a.]|isbn=978-0759106673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262540533|edition=1st MIT Press paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.&lt;ref name="atranhenrich" /&gt; For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.&lt;ref name="purzinpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.&lt;ref name="boyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know? Supernatural Agents' Access to Socially Strategic and Non-Strategic Information|journal=Cognitive Science|date=July 2012|volume=36|issue=5|pages=846–869|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01242.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.&lt;ref name="norenbiggods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.&lt;ref name="pursosis" /&gt; The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.&lt;ref name="botero" /&gt; This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="norenbiggods" /&gt;

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4|pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[reciprocal altruism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=March 1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indirect reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leimar|first1=O|last2=Hammerstein|first2=P|title=Evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 April 2001|volume=268|issue=1468|pages=745–53|pmid=11321064|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1573|pmc=1088665}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=Martin A.|last2=Sigmund|first2=Karl|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring|journal=Nature|date=11 June 1998|volume=393|issue=6685|pages=573–577|doi=10.1038/31225|pmid=9634232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Competitive altruism|competitive helping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|title=Competitive helping increases with the size of biological markets and invades defection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2011|volume=281|issue=1|pages=47–55|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.04.023|pmid=21550351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|title=Culture and the evolution of human cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=5 October 2009|volume=364|issue=1533|pages=3281–3288|doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.&lt;ref name="mathew"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.&lt;ref name="purz12" /&gt;

[[Morality and religion|Religious rules addressing moral behavior]] are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating [[Prosocial behavior|prosociality]].&lt;ref name="norenetalpress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.&lt;ref name="norenetalpress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corelig16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|last2=Apicella|first2=Coren|last3=Atkinson|first3=Quentin D.|last4=Cohen|first4=Emma|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita Anne|last6=Willard|first6=Aiyana K.|last7=Xygalatas|first7=Dimitris|last8=Norenzayan|first8=Ara|last9=Henrich|first9=Joseph|title=Moralistic gods, supernatural punishment and the expansion of human sociality|journal=Nature|date=10 February 2016|volume=530|issue=7590|pages=327–330|doi=10.1038/nature16980|pmid=26863190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,&lt;ref name="purz11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan                            and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt; More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, &amp; witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679724680|edition=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=R. B.|last2=Tayor|first2=N.|last3=Codding|first3=B. F.|last4=Bird|first4=D. W.|title=Niche construction and Dreaming logic: aboriginal patch mosaic burning and varanid lizards (Varanus gouldii) in Australia|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=23 October 2013|volume=280|issue=1772|pages=20132297–20132297|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2297|pmc=3813344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.&lt;ref name="purz11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="purz13" /&gt; More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.&lt;ref name="purzinpress" /&gt;

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational sustainability''' is a broad field that attempts to optimize societal, economic, and environmental resources using methods from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computational-sustainability.org/|title=www.computational-sustainability.org|website=www.computational-sustainability.org|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainability]] in this context is the ability to produce enough energy for the world to support its biological systems.  Using the power of computers to process large quantities of information, decision making algorithms allocate resources based on real-time information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unknown|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf?ip=73.234.206.61&amp;id=1562174&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E4D4702B0C3E38B35%252E6D218144511F3437&amp;CFID=594460368&amp;CFTOKEN=33596010&amp;__acm__=1458873213_60e5758f5509c54d6c6abc8c305ffbc8|doi=10.1145/1570000/1562174/p23-frenkel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications are widespread. [[Smart grid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s implement renewable resources and storage capabilities to control the production and expenditure of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compsust.net/|title=CompSustNet: Home|website=www.compsust.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligent transportation system]] analyze road conditions and relay information to drivers so they can make smarter decisions based on real time traffic information.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero-ibanez|first=J. A.|last2=Zeadally|first2=S.|last3=Contreras-Castillo|first3=J.|date=2015-12-01|title=Integration challenges of intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicle, cloud computing, and internet of things technologies|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7368833|journal=IEEE Wireless Communications|volume=22|issue=6|pages=122–128|doi=10.1109/MWC.2015.7368833|issn=1536-1284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. [[Data collection]] can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a [[mobile app]], like [[Waze]], to report its whereabouts.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44160-2_5|title=Transportation Systems: Monitoring, Control, and Security|last=Timotheou|first=Stelios|last2=Panayiotou|first2=Christos G.|last3=Polycarpou|first3=Marios M.|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783662441596|editor-last=Kyriakides|editor-first=Elias|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|pages=125–166|language=en|editor-last2=Polycarpou|editor-first2=Marios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders.  Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their [[smart card]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at stations and online.  APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones.  Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are.  [[Ramp meter]]s regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups.  Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the number of cars on the road.  Electronic highway signs relay information regarding travel times, detours, and accidents that may affect drivers ability to reach their destination.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With the rise of consumer connectivity, less infrastructure is needed for these ITS to make informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/shift-to-constant-connectivity.html|title=The Shift to Constant Connectivity|website=Think with Google|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Google Maps]] uses smartphone crowdsourcing to get information about real-time traffic conditions allowing motorists to make decisions based on toll roads, travel times, and overall distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncta.com/platform/broadband-internet/how-google-tracks-traffic/|title=How Google Tracks Traffic|website=www.ncta.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cars communicate with their manufacturers to remotely install software updates when new features are added or bugs are being patched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/wireless-updates-to-core-automotive-functions-could-spell-privacy-troubles/|title=Your next car will update itself while you sleep, and maybe watch you too|website=Digital Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tesla Motors]] even uses these updates to increase their cars efficiency and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11378880/Tesla-software-update-did-your-car-just-get-faster.html|title=Tesla software update: did your car just get faster?|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These connections give ITS a means to accurately collect information and even relay that information to drivers with no other infrastructure needed.

Future ITS systems will aid in car communication with not just the infrastructure, but with other cars as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Utilities ==
The [[electrical grid]] was designed to send consumers electricity from [[Electric generator|electricity generators]] for a monthly fee based on usage. Homeowners are installing [[solar panel]]s and large batteries to store the power created by these panels.  A [[smart grid]] is being created to accommodate the new energy sources.  Rather than just electricity being sent to a household to be consumed by the various appliances in the home, electricity can flow in either direction.  Additional sensors along the grid will improve information collection and decreased downtime during power outages. These sensors can also relay information directly to consumers about how much energy they're using and what the costs will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/publications/catalyst/fa14-solar-power-on-the-rise.html#.VwbE4hMrKu4|title=Solar Power on the Rise|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concept testing''' (to be distinguished from '''pre-test markets''' and '''test markets''' which may be used at a later stage of product development research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of using surveys (and sometimes [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative methods]]) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=Concept Testing: How to Test New Product Ideas Before You Go to Market|date=1987|publisher=American Management Association|isbn=978-0814459058|edition=1st|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is '''important not to confuse''' concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison – Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-simplex,&lt;ref&gt;Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or mutlitrait-multimethod models.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.&lt;/ref&gt;
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).&lt;ref&gt;Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

'''Volumetric concept testing'''

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForeSIGHT™ Going-Year Volume Estimates|url=http://www.acupoll.com/volume-forecasts|website=Acupoll|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptor® Volumetric Forecasting|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/analytics/volumetric/|website=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=3|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13098">[[File:Giorgi Latsabidze, University of Southern California, Doctor of Musical Arts.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A graduate student from the [[University of Southern California]] receiving his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in 2011.]]

The '''Doctor of Musical Arts''' ('''D.M.A.''') is a [[doctorates|doctoral]] [[academic degree]] in music. The D.M.A. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually [[Performance|music performance]], [[music composition]], or [[conducting]]) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or [[Music education|music pedagogy]]. The D.M.A. degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional [[performance|performers]], [[conducting|conductors]], and [[musical composition|composers]]. As a [[terminal degree]], the D.M.A. qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in [[musicology]] or [[music theory]] typically enter a [[Ph.D.]] program, rather than a D.M.A. program.

==Terminology==
The degree is also abbreviated as '''DMA''' (without periods), '''D.Mus.A.''' or '''A.Mus.D.'''. For the related degree [[Doctor of Music]], the abbreviation is '''D.M.''' or '''D.Mus.''' For the related degree [[Doctor of Arts]], the abbreviation '''D.A.''' is used.

==Types==
===Concentrations===
The D.M.A. is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title [[Doctor of Music]] (D.M. or D.Mus.) or [[Doctor of Arts]] (D.A.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olemiss.edu/depts/music/degree_programs/grad_degrees.html The University of Mississippi – Department of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; or Doctor in Musical Studies (Ph.D.) instead of D.M.A. The D.M.A. degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]], who approved the first D.M.A. programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the D.M.A.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Latimer, "The Nation's First D.M.A. in Choral Music," ''Journal of Historical Research in Music Education'', 32.1 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Boston University]] offered its first D.M.A. program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into [[online music education]] by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a D.M.A. program (along with a [[Master of Music]] program) in [[music education]].&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of U.S. institutions offer the D.M.A. degree in the 2010s. The Ph.D. is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may  place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written [[dissertation]], regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a D.M.A. or Ph.D.  Also, music education Ph.D. programs may include performance-oriented tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida State University – Conducting Degrees|url=http://www.music.fsu.edu/Areas-of-Study/Conducting/Degree-Programs|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In composition, one may study for either the D.M.A. or the Ph.D., depending on the institution. The Ph.D. is the standard doctorate in [[music theory]], [[musicology]], [[music therapy]], and [[ethnomusicology]].
===Sacred music===
A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (D.S.M.), also ''Sacrae Musica Doctor'' (S.M.D.), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance.  In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (D.C.M.).  Only one U.S. institution, [[Claremont Graduate University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Claremont Graduate University – Doctor of Church Music|url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/8740.asp|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; still offers the D.C.M. degree, in addition to the more typical D.M.A.  The vast majority of U.S. seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at [[Perkins School of Theology]] is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (D.P.M.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smu.edu/Perkins/FacultyAcademics/degrees/dpm/Apply Perkins School of Theology – Doctor of Ministry Program]&lt;/ref&gt;  While more theology-based and housed within the [[Doctor of Ministry]] (D.Min.) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (M.Mus.), Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.), Master of Church Music (M.C.M.), M.A. in Church Music or equivalent 48 semester hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music.

D.M.A. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many D.M.A. programs, all of the different D.M.A. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many D.M.A. programs require students to pass a [[comprehensive exam]] on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the D.M.A. degree is usually the completion of a [[thesis]], [[dissertation]], or research project and the performance of [[recital]]s, usually including at least one lecture-recital.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a D.M.A. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance.

Some institutions permit D.M.A. students to do a sub-specialization in a field ''outside'' music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a D.M.A. in [[piano pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a D.M.A. in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of [[computer engineering]] (e.g., in computer programming).

While teaching experience is not an official part of most D.M.A. programs, most D.M.A. candidates will have the opportunity to work as a [[teaching assistant]] or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. D.M.A. students can teach in an area related to their D.M.A. program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an M.Mus. in piano performance who is doing a D.M.A. in composition), they may teach in another area.

==Admission requirements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
To be admitted to a D.M.A. degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a M.Mus. degree or an M.A. degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of "B+" or higher. D.M.A. programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital—i.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles—in addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing.

Newly admitted D.M.A. students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language – one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) – is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.

== Brief history ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
After World War II, there had been a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the U.S. Armed Forces. The G.I. Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post World War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The Nation's renowned conservatories, such as [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and [[Curtis Institute of Music|Curtis]], at the time, saw no need for the degree – yet many [[alumni]] of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education.

In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work "in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided." The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the [[American Council on Education]]. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;"NTSTC One of 32 Colleges for Graduate Study in Music", ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', December 31, 1942, Sec I, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953.

* [[Eastman School of Music]] (the DMA degree was approved by the State of New York Board of Regents in 1953)
* [[Boston University]]
* [[University of Southern California]]

The Dean of the [[University of Rochester]] [[Eastman School of Music]], Howard Harold Hanson (1896–1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high-profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.

In 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, PhD, professor of musicology at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Degrees to Musicians – Dissenters Claim Title Not Necessary", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', November 15, 1953, p. 9F&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Doctor of Musical Arts conferred'''
* 1954: Mathias "Matt" Higgins Doran, DMA (born 1921), [[University of Southern California]]
* 1955: [[Will Gay Bottje]], DMA (born 1925), [[Eastman School of Music]] – some sources attribute Bottje as having been the first in the nation to earn the degree&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6AAKBSlQAxMC&amp;pg ''Howard Hanson: In Theory and Practice''], by Allen Laurence Cohen, p. 14, [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] (2004) {{OCLC|52559264}} {{ISBN|9780313321351}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 1955: Edward F. Gilday, Jr., DMA, [[Boston University]]

'''Non-NASM institutions'''

The alumni of Music conservatories in the United States also seek positions at universities.  The conservatories that are not affiliated with the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] began offering DMAs in the late 1960s.

* 1971: Margaret Hee-Leng Tan, [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] – she is the first woman to earn a DMA from Juilliard; Juilliard added the degree in 1969, the year it moved to [[Lincoln Center]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11269">'''Ecological forecasting''' uses knowledge of physics, ecology and physiology to predict how ecological [[Population|populations]], [[Community (ecology)|communities]], or [[ecosystem]]s will change in the future in response to environmental factors such as [[climate change]]. The ultimate goal of the approach is to provide people such as resource managers and designers of [[marine reserve]]s with information that they can then use to respond, in advance, to future changes,&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"&gt;Clark et al. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[adaptation to global warming]].

One of the most important environmental factors for organisms today is [[global warming]].  Most physiological processes are affected by [[temperature]], and so even small changes in [[weather]] and [[climate]] can lead to large changes in the growth, reproduction and survival of animals and plants.  The [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Joint science academies' statement: The science of climate change |url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13619 |quote=The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |date=2001-05-17 |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000125/http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13619 |archivedate=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=2007-10-18 | title=Rising to the climate challenge | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=449 | issue=7164 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/full/449755a.html | accessdate=2007-11-06 | pages=755 | doi=10.1038/449755a | pmid=17943093}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
is that the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases due to human activity caused most of the warming observed since the start of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial era]]. These changes are in turn affecting human and natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;CCSP 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One major challenge is to predict where, when and with what magnitude changes are likely to occur so that we can mitigate or at least prepare for them.&lt;ref name="Clark et al. 2001"/&gt; Ecological forecasting applies existing knowledge of how animals and plants interact with their physical environment&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006"&gt;Kearney 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to ask how changes in  environmental factors might result in changes to the ecosystems as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wethey and Woodin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Ecological forecasting varies in spatial and temporal extent, as well as in what is being forecast (presence, abundance, diversity, production, etc.).

* Population models may be used to generate short-term abundance forecasts using knowledge of [[population dynamics]] and recent environmental conditions. These models are used especially in [[Population dynamics of fisheries|fisheries]] and [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|disease]] forecasting. 
* [[Environmental niche modelling|Species distribution models]] (SDMs) may be used to forecast [[species distribution]] (presence or abundance) over longer ecological time scales using information about past and projected environmental conditions across the landscape.
** Correlative SDMs, also known as climate envelope models, rely on statistical correlations between existing species distributions (range boundaries) and environmental variables to outline a range (envelope) of environmental conditions within which a species can exist.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;Pearson and Dawson 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elith|first=Jane|last2=Leathwick|first2=John R.|date=2009|title=Species Distribution Models: Ecological Explanation and Prediction Across Space and Time|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=677–697|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159|issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New range boundaries can then be forecast using future levels of environmental factors such as [[temperature]], [[rainfall]], and [[salinity]] from climate model projections. These methods are good for examining large numbers of species, but are likely not a good means of predicting effects at fine scales.
** Mechanistic SDMs use information about a species' physiological tolerances and constraints, as well as models of organismal body temperature and other biophysical properties, to define the range of environmental conditions within which a species can exist. These tolerances are mapped onto current and projected environmental conditions in the landscape to outline current and forecasted ranges for the species.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to "climate envelope" approaches, mechanistic SDMs model the fundamental niche directly, and are therefore much more exact.&lt;ref name="Kearney 2006" /&gt;  However, the approach requires more information is also usually more time consuming.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;
*Other types of models may be used to forecast (or hindcast) biodiversity over evolutionary time scales. Palaeobiology modeling uses fossil and phylogenetic evidence of biodiversity in the past to project the trajectory of biodiversity in the future. Simple plots can be constructed and then adjusted based on the varying quality of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sahney, S.|author2=Benton, M.J.|author3=Ferry, P.A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forecasting examples==

===Biodiversity===
Using fossil evidence, studies have shown that vertebrate biodiversity has grown exponentially through Earth's history and that biodiversity is entwined with the diversity of Earth's habitats. 
{{quote|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence biodiversity will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."|Sahney ''et al''.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;}}

Winner of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s 2014 Award for Corporate Excellence
,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/ace# |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106173159/https://www.state.gov/e/eb/ace/# |archive-date=January 6, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2010 by Troy Wiseman and Camille Rebelo, EcoPlanet Bamboo has pioneered the industrialization of bamboo as an alternative fiber for timber manufacturing industries. To date the Company has 37,250 acres of bamboo farms under ownership, in Central American, Western and Southern Africa, with larger scale [[plantation]]s underway.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is a privately owned United States Company, registered in Delaware and with corporate headquarters located outside of Chicago, Illinois. It is a US Series LLC allowing each geographic region and individual bamboo plantation to be funded and operated separately but under the same umbrella.

The Company has been recognized for its social impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131017005822/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Wins-IAIR-Award-Sustainability|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Wins IAIR Award for Sustainability|website=Businesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; created more than 750 jobs and operates in some of the poorest parts of the world in [[Nicaragua]], South Africa and [[Ghana]].

EcoPlanet Bamboo plants species of tropical clumping ([[sympodial]]) bamboos, using only highly degraded&lt;ref&gt;''EcoPlanet Bamboo uses the UNFCCC tool for the Identification of Degraded Land.''&lt;/ref&gt; and marginal land to produce a tree free, [[deforestation]] free fiber. The Company has developed a framework for what sustainability means in respect to [[bamboo]]. Farms reach maturity in 5–7 years and the fiber is targeted towards [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]] dependent on wood and fiber as their raw resource.

The company is highly decentralized with individual bamboo plantations operating under EcoPlanet Bamboo Groups standardized operational framework to achieve [[Forest restoration|Forest Landscape Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etfrn.org/file.php/302/4.6-ecoplanet-bamboo.pdf|format=PDF|title=4.6 Commercial bamboo plantations as a tool for restoring landscapes|website=Etfrn.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full set of qualified managerial staff exists on each farm and is overseen by a core managerial team.

==Bamboo in China==
Although bamboo is a plant that has been grown and harvested in China for generations, it occurs only within a smallholder model. There are few commercial or large scale managed plantations. The majority of area under bamboo comprises plots of a few Mu in size, owned by individual farmers or families, and managed as part of a [[Crop diversity|diverse]] mix of livelihood crops. Throughout China bamboo has been planted only in areas not suitable for agriculture, which generally mean mountainous land that is often inaccessible. Most of China's bamboo industry is focused on a single iconic species – [[Phyllostachys edulis|Moso (''Phyllostachys edulis'')]]

The processing of bamboo in China is dominated by low and medium level processing, with a large focus on two very different markets (1) the global handicraft industry and (2) the production of [[Bamboo shoot|edible bamboo shoots]] for the food industry. In recent years there has been an increase in the production of [[bamboo floor]]ing.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is working in a different manner growing certified bamboo fiber for the [[pulp and paper industry]], textiles and [[Engineered wood|engineered timber]].

==Historical barriers to industrialization of bamboo==
EcoPlanet Bamboo claims to have overcome many barriers to industrialize bamboo as a commercial crop:
# A lack of planting material.  See “[[Bamboo#Mass flowering|bamboo mass flowering]]".
# Lack of knowledge on the growth, ecology and yields of bamboos other than Moso.
# High investment required to take bamboo through the 6–7 years required to reach maturity.
# Difficulty of operating in remote parts of the developing world.

==Bamboo sustainability==
EcoPlanet Bamboo is a triple bottom line company promoting the concept of conscious capitalism. The company has pioneered the concept of sustainability certification for commercially produced bamboo.

'''Ecotechnology''' - not to be confused with [[ecotechnics]] - is an [[applied science]] that seeks to fulfill [[human]] needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the '[[ecology]] of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of [[ecosystems]] and societies. All [[sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of [[biodiversity]] and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology.

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered.

Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment.

Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Max|title=Eco-Friendly IT Solutions that Minimise Environmental Damage and Save Natural Resources|url=https://magora-systems.com/eco-friendly-it-solutions/|publisher=Magora|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources,
* control of impacts on ecosystems,
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,
* eco-marketing,
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public.

During ''Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering'' in [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]], the participants agreed on the definition: "Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames."

As each egg was laid, it would roll from the hen's cage and trigger a mercury switch, connected to a panel. The panel would relay a pulse to the Eggatron, prompting a converted P.M.G. teletyper to print and time-stamp on a roll of paper tape. The recorded data was duplicated on magnetic tape, and fed into a [[SILLIAC]] computer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 1962|title=The Eggatron|url=|journal=Rural Research in CSIRO|location=East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia|publisher=CSIRO: Agricultural Research Liaison Section|volume=41|pages=36-[37].|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape data assisted in identifying the birds with high egg production levels, who were then selected for breeding.

First mentioned in a 1962 Australian journal article,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the development of the Eggatron was attributed to Dr. P.J. Claringbold of Sydney University's Veterinary Physiology Department, but the device was designed by Dr. Rathgeber of the Physics Department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Eggatron is but one of many [[tron]]-like developments of Cold War science that sought to control nature through technology, primarily through large centralized computer systems. The development of the [[phytotron]], [[algatron]], ecotron and zootron represents the explosion of these technologies through the 1950s and 1960s.

'''Environmental studies''' is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies [[human behavior|human interaction]] with the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the interests of solving complex problems. Environmental studies brings together the principles of the physical sciences, commerce/economics and social sciences so as to solve contemporary environmental problems. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]], and the sets of relationships between them. The field encompasses study in basic principles of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], as well as associated subjects such as [[environmental ethics|ethics]], [[environmental geography|geography]], [[anthropology]], [[environmental policy|policy]], [[environmental politics|politics]], [[urban planning]], [[environmental law|law]], [[environmental economics|economics]], [[environmental philosophy|philosophy]], [[environmental sociology|sociology]] and [[environmental justice|social justice]], [[environmental planning|planning]], [[pollution control]] and [[natural resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Education Statistics]].

'''Euxinia''' or '''euxinic conditions''' occur when water is both [[Anoxic event|anoxic]] and sulfidic. This means that there is no [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a raised level of free [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Euxinic bodies of water are frequently strongly stratified, have an oxic, highly productive, thin surface layer, and have anoxic, sulfidic bottom water.  The word euxinia is derived from the Greek name for the Black Sea- Εὔξεινος Πόντος (''Euxeinos Pontos)''- which translates to "hospitable sea".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Katja M.|last2=Kump|first2=Lee R.|date=2008-04-29|title=Oceanic Euxinia in Earth History: Causes and Consequences|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=251–288|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinic deep water is a key component of the [[Canfield ocean]], a model of oceans during the Proterozoic known as the [[Boring Billion]] proposed by [[Donald Canfield]], an American geologist, in 1998.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is still debate within the scientific community on both the duration and frequency of euxinic conditions in the ancient oceans.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|date=2008-08-15|title=Ironing Out Ocean Chemistry at the Dawn of Animal Life|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/923|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=923–924|doi=10.1126/science.1162870|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18703731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euxinia is relatively rare in modern bodies of water, but does still happen in places like the Black Sea and certain fjords.

== Background ==
Euxinia most frequently occurred in the Earth's ancient oceans, but its distribution and frequency of occurrence are still under debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Timothy W.|last2=Anbar|first2=Ariel D.|last3=Severmann|first3=Silke|last4=Scott|first4=Clint|last5=Gill|first5=Benjamin C.|date=2009-04-27|title=Tracking Euxinia in the Ancient Ocean: A Multiproxy Perspective and Proterozoic Case Study|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=507–534|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.36.031207.124233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original model was that it was quite constant for approximately a billion years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some meta-analyses have questioned how persistent euxinic conditions were based on relatively small [[black shale]] deposits in a period when the ocean should have theoretically been preserving more organic matter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] happened approximately 2.3 billion years ago, there was little free oxygen in either the atmosphere or the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12415-5_1|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|last=Torres|first=Martha E.

Sosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought that the ocean accumulated oxygen soon after the atmosphere did, but this idea was challenged by Canfield in 1998 when he proposed that instead of the deep ocean becoming oxidizing, it became sulfidic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=D. E.|year=|title=A new model for Proterozoic ocean chemistry|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/24839|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6710|pages=450–453|doi=10.1038/24839|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is partially based on the disappearance of [[banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s from the geological records 1.8 billion years ago. Canfield argued that although enough oxygen entered the atmosphere to erode sulfides in continental rocks, there was not enough oxygen to mix into the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would result in an anoxic deep ocean with an increased flux of sulfur from the continents. The sulfur would strip iron ions from the sea water, resulting in [[iron sulfide]] (pyrite), a portion of which was eventually buried. When sulfide became the major oceanic [[oxidant]] instead of iron, the deep water became euxinic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This has become what is known as the [[Canfield ocean]], a model backed by the increase in presence of δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sedimentary [[pyrite]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the discovery of evidence of the first sulfate [[evaporite]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melezhik|first=Victor A.|last2=Fallick|first2=Anthony E.|last3=Rychanchik|first3=Dmitry V.|last4=Kuznetsov|first4=Anton B.|date=2005-04-01|title=Palaeoproterozoic evaporites in Fennoscandia: implications for seawater sulphate, the rise of atmospheric oxygen and local amplification of the δ13C excursion|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x/abstract|journal=Terra Nova|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.2005.00600.x|issn=1365-3121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anoxic event|Anoxia]] and sulfidic conditions often occur together. In anoxic conditions anaerobic, sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate into sulfide, creating sulfidic conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emergence of this metabolic pathway was very important in the pre-oxygenated oceans because adaptations to otherwise inhabitable or "toxic" environments like this may have played a role in the diversification of early eukaryotes and protozoa in the pre-Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Euxinia still occurs occasionally today, mostly in [[meromictic lakes]] and silled basins such as the [[Black Sea]] and some fjords.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is rare in modern times; less than 0.5% of today's sea floor is euxinic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:How oceans become euxinic.png|thumb|600x600px|Diagram of mechanisms of euxinia in the Canfield Ocean]]
The basic requirements for the formation of euxinic conditions are the absence of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and the presence of [[Sulfate|sulfate ions]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), organic matter (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|bacteria]] capable of reducing sulfate to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria utilize the [[redox]] potential of sulfate as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] and organic matter as a [[Reducing agent|reductant]] to generate chemical energy through [[Anaerobic respiration|cellular respiration]]. The chemical species of interest can be represented via the reaction:

2CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

In the reaction above the sulfur has been reduced to form the [[By-product|byproduct]] hydrogen sulfide, the characteristic compound present in water under euxinic conditions. Although sulfate reduction occurs in waters throughout the world, most modern-day aquatic habitats are oxygenated due to [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] production of oxygen and [[gas exchange]] between the atmosphere and surface water. Sulfate reduction in these environments is often limited to occurring in [[seabed]] [[sediment]]s that have a strong [[redox gradient]] and become [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] at some depth below the [[Sediment–water interface|sediment-water interface]]. In the ocean the [[Reaction rate|rate]] of these reactions is not [https://online.science.psu.edu/biol011_active002/node/4343 limited] by sulfate, which has been present in large quantities throughout the oceans for the past 2.1 billion years.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] increased atmospheric oxygen concentrations such that oxidative [[weathering]] of [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]] became a major source of sulfate to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=E.

The reduction of sulfate does not give as much energy to an organism as reduction of oxygen or [[nitrate]], so the concentrations of these other elements must be nearly zero for sulfate-reducing bacteria to out-compete [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[denitrifying bacteria]]. In most modern settings these conditions only occur in a small portion of sediments, resulting in insufficient concentrations of hydrogen sulfide to form euxinic waters.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Conditions required for the formation of persistent euxinia include [[anoxic waters]], high [[nutrient]] levels, and a [[Stratification (water)|stratified]] water column.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These conditions are not all-inclusive and are based largely on modern observations of euxinia. Conditions leading up to and triggering large-scale euxinic events, such as the [[Canfield ocean]], are likely the result of multiple interlinking factors, many of which have been inferred through studies of the [[geologic record]] at relevant locations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The formation of stratified anoxic waters with high nutrient levels is influenced by a variety of global and local-scale phenomena such as the presence of nutrient traps and a warming climate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nutrient traps ===
In order for euxinic conditions to persist, a positive feedback loop must exist that perpetuates organic matter export to bottom waters and reduction of sulfate under anoxic conditions. Organic matter export is driven by high levels of primary production in the [[photic zone]], supported by a continual supply of nutrients to the oxic surface waters. A natural source of nutrients, such as phosphate ({{chem|PO|4|3−}}), comes from [[weathering]] of rocks and subsequent transport of these dissolved nutrients via rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=C. M.|last2=Mills|first2=M. M.|last3=Arrigo|first3=K. R.|last4=Berman-Frank|first4=I.|last5=Bopp|first5=L.|last6=Boyd|first6=P. W.|last7=Galbraith|first7=E. D.|last8=Geider|first8=R.

==== Geography ====
[[File:FjordCirculation.JPG|thumb|399x399px|A simplified model of estuarine circulation in a silled basin. Depicted here is a three-layered body of water which has been further simplified in the article by combining the intermediate and deep layers.]]
The arrangement of the continents has changed over time due to [[plate tectonics]], resulting in the [[bathymetry]] of ocean basins also changing over time. The shape and size of the basins influences the circulation patterns and concentration of nutrients within them. [[Computer simulation|Numerical models]] simulating past arrangements of continents have shown that nutrient traps can form in certain scenarios, increasing local concentrations of phosphate and setting up potential euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On a smaller scale, silled basins often act as nutrient traps due to their typical [[Estuarine water circulation|estuarine circulation]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Estuarine circulation occurs where surface water is replenished from river input and precipitation, causing an outflow of surface waters from the basin, while deep water flows into the basin over the sill. This type of circulation allows for anoxic, high nutrient bottom water to develop within the basin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Stratification ====
Stratified waters, in combination with slow vertical mixing, are essential to maintaining euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stratification occurs when two or more water masses with different densities occupy the same basin. While the less dense surface water can exchange gas with the oxygen-rich atmosphere, the denser bottom waters maintain low oxygen content. In the modern oceans, [[thermohaline circulation]] and [[upwelling]] prevent the oceans from maintaining anoxic bottom waters. In a silled basin, the stable stratified layers only allow surface water to flow out of the basin while the deep water remains anoxic and relatively unmixed. During an intrusion of dense saltwater however, the nutrient-rich bottom water upwells, causing increased [[Primary production|productivity]] in the surface, further enhancing the nutrient trap due to [[biological pump]]ing. Rising sea level can exacerbate this process by increasing the amount of deep water entering a silled basin and enhancing estuarine circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelburg|first=J.

=== Warming climate ===
A warming climate increases surface temperatures of waters which effects multiple aspects of euxinic water formation. As waters warm, the [[solubility]] of [[Ocean deoxygenation|oxygen decreases]], allowing for deep anoxic waters to form more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hotinski|first=Roberta M.|year=2001|title=Ocean stagnation and end-Permian anoxia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235451836_Ocean_Stagnation_and_end_Permian_anoxia|journal=Geology|volume=29|pages=7–10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the warmer water causes increased respiration of organic matter leading to further oxygen depletion. Higher temperatures enhance the hydrologic cycle, increasing evaporation from bodies of water, resulting in increased precipitation. This causes higher rates of weathering of rocks and therefore higher nutrient concentrations in river outflows. The nutrients allow for more productivity resulting in more [[marine snow]] and subsequently lower oxygen in deep waters due to increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Volcanism has also been proposed to be a factor in creating euxinic conditions. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) released during [[Volcanism|volcanic]] outgassing causes [[global warming]] which has cascading effects on the formation of euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Evidence for euxinic events ==

=== Black shale ===
[[File:Black shale, Kansas City MO - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Black shale is one of the preliminary indicators of anoxia and perhaps euxinia]]
Black shales are organic rich, microlaminated sedimentary rocks often associated with bottom water anoxia. This is because anoxia slows the degradation of organic matter, allowing for greater burial in the sediments. Other evidence for anoxic burial of black shale includes the lack of [[bioturbation]], meaning that there were no organisms burrowing into the sediment because there was no oxygen for respiration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There must also be a source of organic matter for burial, generally from production near the oxic surface. Many papers discussing ancient euxinic events use the presence of black shale as a preliminary proxy for anoxic bottom waters, but it should be noted that their presence does not in and of itself indicate euxinia or even strong anoxia. Generally geochemical testing is needed to provide better evidence for conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Geochemistry ===
Some researchers study the occurrence of euxinia in ancient oceans because it was more prevalent then than it is today. Since ancient oceans cannot be directly observed, scientists use geology and chemistry to find evidence in [[sedimentary rock]] created under euxinic conditions. Some of these techniques come from studying modern examples of euxinia, while others are derived from geochemistry. Though modern euxinic environments have geochemical properties in common with ancient euxinic oceans, the physical processes causing euxinia most likely vary between the two.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Isotopes ====
[[Stable isotope ratio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s can be used to infer the environmental conditions during the formation of sedimentary rock. Using [[stoichiometry]] and knowledge of [[redox]] pathways, paleogeologists can use [[isotope]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ratios of elements to determine the chemical composition of the water and sediments when burial occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945435170|title=Stable isotope geochemistry|last=Jochen.|first=Hoefs,|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319197159|oclc=945435170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur isotopes are frequently used to look for evidence of ancient euxinia. Low δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in black shales and sedimentary rocks provides positive evidence for euxinic formation conditions. The pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in euxinic basins typically has higher concentrations of light sulfur isotopes than pyrite in the modern ocean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The reduction of sulfate to sulfide favors the lighter sulfur isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S) and becomes depleted in the heavier isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S). This lighter sulfide then bonds with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to form FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is then partially preserved in the sediments. In most modern systems, sulfate eventually becomes limiting, and the isotopic weights of sulfur in both sulfate and sulfide (preserved as FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) become equal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Molybdenum (Mo), the most common transition metal ion in modern seawater, is also used to look for evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Weathering of rocks provides an input of MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; into oceans. Under oxic conditions, MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;  is very unreactive, but in modern euxinic environments such as the [[Black Sea]], molybdenum precipitates out as oxythiomolybdate (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4−x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; ).&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=G.

==== Trace-element enrichment ====
Under euxinic conditions, some trace elements such as Mo, U, V, Cd, Cu, Tl, Ni, Sb, and Zn, become insoluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algeo|first=Thomas J|last2=Maynard|first2=J.

==== Organic biomarkers ====
[[File:Purple and Green Sulfur Bacteria and Their Biomarkers.png|thumb|440x440px|Pigments from purple and green sulfur reducing bacteria are strong evidence for euxinic conditions]]
Bacteria such as [[green sulfur bacteria]] (GSB) and [[purple sulfur bacteria]] (PSB), which exist where the photic zone overlaps with euxinic water masses, leave pigments behind in sediments.  These pigments can be used to identify past euxinic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The pigments used to identify past presesnce of GSB are [[chlorobactane]] and [[isorenieratene]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overmann|first=Jörg|last2=Cypionka|first2=Heribert|last3=Pfennig|first3=Norbert|date=1992-01-01|title=An extremely low-light adapted phototrophic sulfur bacterium from the Black Sea|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0150/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=150–155|doi=10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0150|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pigments used to identify past presence of PSB is [[okenane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overmann|first=Jörg|last2=Sandmann|first2=Gerhard|last3=Hall|first3=Ken J.|last4=Northcote|first4=Tom G.|date=1993-03-01|title=Fossil carotenoids and paleolimnology of meromictic Mahoney Lake, British Columbia, Canada|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00877257|journal=Aquatic Sciences|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=31–39|doi=10.1007/BF00877257|issn=1015-1621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iron geochemistry ====
[[Pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral formed by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and bioreactive iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). In oxic bottom waters pyrite can only form in sediments where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. However, in iron-rich euxinic environments, pyrite formation can occur at higher rates in both the water column and in sediments due to higher concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Threfore the presence of euxinic conditions can be inferred by the ratio of pyrite-bound iron to the total iron in sediments.

== Euxinic events in Earth's history ==

  [[File:Timeline of euxinia in ancient oceans.png|thumb|660x660px|Presence of euxinia in the world's ancient deep oceans. According to Canfield, the deep ocean became sulfitic around 1.8 billion years ago and stayed that way for much of the boring billion. Periodic euxinia dominated through the Late Devonian Kelwasser events, and then most likely disappeared during the Carboniferous. Euxinia reemerged at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, and may have been present during the Ocean Anoxia Events of the Mesozoic. Euxinia is rare in Cenozoic oceans. Adapted from Lyons, 2008&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;]]

=== Proterozoic ===
The Proterozoic is the transition era between anoxic and oxygenated oceans. The classic model is that the end of the [[Banded iron formation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BIFs) was due to the injection of oxygen into the deep ocean, an approximately 0.6 billion year lag behind the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Heinrich D.|date=2006-06-29|year=|title=The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/361/1470/903|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=361|issue=1470|pages=903–915|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1838|issn=0962-8436|pmid=16754606|via=|pmc=1578726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canfield, however, argued that anoxia lasted much longer, and the end of the banded iron formations was due to the introduction of sulfide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supporting Canfield's original hypothesis, 1.84 billion year old sedimentary records have been found in the Animike group in Canada that exhibit close to full pyritization on top of the last of the banded iron formations, showing evidence of a transition to euxinic conditions in that basin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poulton|first=Simon W.|last2=Fralick|first2=Philip W.|last3=Canfield|first3=Donald E.|date=2004-09-09|title=The transition to a sulphidic ocean {{!}}[sim]{{!}} 1.84 billion years ago|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7005/full/nature02912.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=431|issue=7005|pages=173–177|doi=10.1038/nature02912|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for full pyritization to happen, nearly all of the sulfate in the water was reduced to sulfide, which stripped the iron from the water, forming pyrite. Because this basin was open to the ocean, deep euxinia was interpreted as being a widespread phenomena.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This euxinia is hypothesized to have lasted until about 0.8 billion years ago, making basin bottom euxinia a potentially widespread feature throughout the [[Boring Billion]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Further evidence for euxinia was discovered in the McArthur Basin in Australia, where similar iron chemistry was found.

Molybdenum isotopes have been used to examine the distribution of euxinia in the Proterozoic eon, and suggest that perhaps euxinia was not as widespread as Canfield initially postulated. Bottom waters may have been more widely suboxic than anoxic, and there could have been negative feedback between euxinia and the high levels of surface primary production needed to sustain euxinic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=C.|last2=Lyons|first2=T.

=== Phanerozoic ===
There is evidence for multiple euxinic events during the Phanerozoic. It is most likely that euxinia was periodic during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but geologic data is too sparse to draw any large scale conclusions. In this eon, there is some evidence that euxinic events are potentially linked with mass extinction events including the [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Paleozoic ====

The periodic presence of euxinic conditions in the Lower Cambrian has been supported by evidence found on the Yangtze platform in South China. Sulfur isotopes during the transition from Proterozoic to Phanerozoic give evidence for widespread euxinia, perhaps lasting throughout the Cambrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Benjamin C, Timothy W Lyons, Seth a Young, Lee R Kump, Andrew H Knoll, and Matthew R Saltzman. 2010. “Geochemical Evidence for Widespread Euxinia in the Later Cambrian Ocean.” ''Nature'' 469 (7328): 80–83. doi:10.1038/nature09700.&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the Lower Cambrian, the euxinic chemocline grew deeper until euxinia was present only in the sediments, and once sulfate became limiting, conditions became anoxic instead of euxinic. Some areas eventually became oxic, while others eventually returned to euxinic for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Tatiana|last2=Strauss|first2=Harald|last3=Guo|first3=Qingjun|last4=Liu|first4=Congqiang|date=2007-10-08|title=Reconstructing marine redox conditions for the Early Cambrian Yangtze Platform: Evidence from biogenic sulphur and organic carbon isotopes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018207001800|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|series=From Snowball Earth to the Cambrian bioradiation: calibration of Ediacaran-Cambrian history in South China|volume=254|issue=1–2|pages=175–193|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.03.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geological records from the paleozoic in the Selwyn Basin in Northern Canada have also shown evidence for episodic stratification and mixing, where, using δ&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S, it was determined that hydrogen sulfide was more prevalent than [[sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodfellow|first=Wayne D|last2=Jonasson|first2=Ian R|year=1984|title=Data from ocean stagnation and ventilation defined by secular trends in pyrite and baritye, Selwyn Basin, Yukon|url=|journal=Geology|volume=12|pages=583–586|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not originally attributed to euxinia, further studies found that seawater in that time likely had low concentrations of sulfate, meaning that the sulfur in the water was primarily in the form of sulfide. This combined with organic-rich black shale provide strong evidence for euxinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=Tim K.|last2=Hardie|first2=Lawrence A.|last3=Timofeeff|first3=Michael N.|last4=Demicco|first4=Robert V.|title=Secular variation in seawater chemistry and the origin of calcium chloride basinal brines|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG19728R.1|journal=Geology|volume=31|issue=10|doi=10.1130/g19728r.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is similar evidence in the black shales in the mid-continent North America from the Devonian and early Mississippian periods.

Evidence for euxinia has also been tied to the [[Kellwasser event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the Late Devonian Extinction event. Euxinia in basinal waters in what is now central Europe (Germany, Poland, and France) persisted for part of the late Devonian, and may have spread up into shallow waters, contributing to the extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=David|last2=Wignall|first2=Paul B.|last3=Racki|first3=Grzegorz|date=2004-03-01|title=Extent and duration of marine anoxia during the Frasnian–Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction in Poland, Germany, Austria and France|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/div-classtitleextent-and-duration-of-marine-anoxia-during-the-frasnianfamennian-late-devonian-mass-extinction-in-poland-germany-austria-and-francediv/E23779056D0B8D8520D5A7E04FFF5B1D|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=141|issue=2|pages=173–193|doi=10.1017/S0016756804008866|issn=1469-5081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was perhaps a period of oxygenation of bottom waters during the [[Carboniferous]], most likely between the Late Devonian Extinction and the Permian-Triassic Extinction, at which point euxinia would be very rare in the paleo oceans.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] may also have some ties to euxinia, with hypercapnia and hydrogen sulfide toxicity killing off many species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=K.

==== Mesozoic ====

The Mesozoic is well known for its distinct [[Ocean anoxic event|Ocean Anoxic Event]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (OAEs) which resulted in the burial of layers of black shale. Although these OAEs are not stand alone evidence for euxinia, many do contain biomarkers which support euxinic formation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Again, evidence is not universal. OAEs may have spurred the spread of existing euxinia, especially in upwelling regions or semi-restricted basins, but photic zone euxinia did not happen everywhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cenozoic ====
Few episodes of euxinia are evident in the sedimentary record during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since the end of the Cretaceous OAEs, it is most likely that the oceanic bottom waters have stayed oxic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Modern euxinia ==
 
Euxinic conditions have nearly vanished from Earth's open-ocean environments, but a few small scale examples still exist today. Many of these locations share common biogeochemical characteristics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, low rates of overturning and vertical mixing of the total water column is common in euxinic bodies of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Small surface area to depth ratios allow multiple stable layers to form while limiting wind-driven overturning and thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, restricted mixing enhances stratified layers of high nutrient density which are reinforced by biological recycling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the chemocline, highly specialized organisms, such as green sulfur bacteria (GSB) take advantage of the strong redox potential gradient and minimal sunlight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The only connection between the open ocean and the Black Sea is the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Strait]], through which dense Mediterranean waters are imported.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Subsequently, numerous rivers, such as the [[Danube]], [[Don River (Russia)|Don]], [[Dnieper]], and [[Dniester]], drain fresh water into the Black Sea, which floats on top of the more dense Mediterranean water, causing a strong, stratified water column.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This stratification is maintained by a strong [[pycnocline]] which restricts ventilation of deep waters and results in an intermediate layer called the [[chemocline]], a sharp boundary separating oxic surface waters from anoxic bottom waters usually between 50m and 100m depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=J.

[[Meromictic lake]]s are poorly mixed and anoxic bodies of water with strong vertical stratification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While meromictic lakes are frequently categorized as bodies of water with the potential for euxinic conditions, many do not exhibit euxinia.

[[File:Mariager fjord vinter.jpg|thumb|Mariager fjord often produces a "rotten egg" smell in the summer due to sulfur content.]]

=== North Sea fjords ===
Some [[fjord]]s develop euxinia if the connection to the open ocean is constricted, similar to the case of the Black Sea. This constriction prohibits relatively dense, oxygen-rich oceanic water from mixing with the bottom water of the fjord, which leads to stable stratified layers in the fjord.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low salinity melt water forms a lens of fresh, low density water on top of a more dense mass of bottom water.

==== Framvaren Fjord ====

This fjord was born as a glacial lake that was separated from the open ocean (the North Sea) when it was lifted during glacial rebound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A shallow channel (2m deep) was dug in 1850, providing a marginal connection to the North Sea.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A strong pycnocline separates fresh surface water from dense, saline bottom water, and this pycnolcine reduces mixing between the layers. Anoxic conditions persist below the chemocline at 20m, and the fjord has the highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic marine world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millero|first=Frank J.|date=1991-07-01|title=The oxidation of H2S in Framvaren Fjord|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=36|issue=5|pages=1007–1014|doi=10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.1007|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Like the Black Sea, vertical overlap of oxygen and sulfur is limited, but the decline of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S approaching the chemocline from below is indicative of oxidation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which has been attributed to manganese and iron oxides, photo-autotrophic bacteria, and entrainment of oxygen horizontally from the boundaries of the fjord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Wensheng|last2=Millero|first2=Frank J.|title=The chemistry of the anoxic waters in the Framvaren Fjord, Norway|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01025231|journal=Aquatic Geochemistry|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=53–88|doi=10.1007/BF01025231|issn=1380-6165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These oxidation processes are similar to those present in the Black Sea.

Two strong seawater intrusion events have occurred through the channel in recent history (1902 and 1942).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seawater intrusions to fjords force dense, salty, oxygen-rich water into the typically anoxic, sulfidic bottom waters of euxinic fjords.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pakhomova|first=Svetlana|last2=Braaten|first2=Hans Fredrik|last3=Yakushev|first3=Evgeniy|last4=Skei|first4=Jens|date=2014-04-28|year=|title=Biogeochemical consequences of an oxygenated intrusion into an anoxic fjord|url=http://www.geochemicaltransactions.com/content/15/1/5|journal=Geochemical Transactions|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1186/1467-4866-15-5|issn=1467-4866|pmid=24872727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events result in a temporary disturbance to the chemocline, raising the depth at which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is detected. The breakdown of the chemocline causes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to react with dissolved oxygen in a redox reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This decreases the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the biologically active photic zone which can result in basin-scale fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The 1942 event, in particular, was strong enough to chemically reduce the vast majority of oxygen and elevate the chemocline to the air-water interface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This caused a temporary state of total anoxia in the fjord, and resulted in dramatic fish mortality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mariager Fjord ====

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

'''Food for the Hungry''' (also known as FH) is an international relief and development organization with operations in more than 20 countries. Food for the Hungry was founded in 1971 by Dr. Larry Ward.&lt;ref name="ECFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfa.org/MemberProfile.aspx?ID=5160 |title=Food for the Hungry (Accredited Organization Profile) |publisher=ECFA.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food for the Hungry's stated mission is "to walk with leaders, churches and families in overcoming all forms of human poverty by living in healthy relationship with [[God]] and His creation"&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/vision |title=About &amp;#124; Vision and Mission &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was taken from [[Book of Psalms]] 146:7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. Food for the Hungry is a charter member of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], since February 1, 1980.&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt;

== History ==
Larry Ward founded the organization in 1971, with offices in [[Southern California]]. He moved the offices to [[Arizona]] in 1974. Early projects included helping [[refugees]] in war-torn [[Bangladesh]], victims of the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]], rescuing Vietnamese "[[boat people]]" from the [[South China Sea]], and helping hungry and needy people in [[Haiti]] and West Africa. The child sponsorship program was started in 1978. Hunger Corps, the people-sending division of Food for the Hungry, began in 1979.

Dr. Larry Ward retired as president of both the U.S. fundraising office and the international implementation arm of Food for the Hungry in 1984. He was succeeded by [[Ted Yamamori]], Ph.D. As a young child, Yamamori had his own near-starvation experience at the end of [[World War II]] in [[Japan]]. He survived, thanks to the kindness of strangers. Dr. Yamamori retired in 2001, at which point two people were hired to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/feeding-the-hungry|title=Feeding the Hungry Dr. Tetsunao Yamamori &amp; Food for the Hungry|publisher=Mission Frontiers|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Randall Hoag was appointed president of Food for the Hungry International, and Benjamin K. Homan was appointed president of Food for the Hungry/U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/food-for-the-hungry-phoenix-officials-assess-relief-programs-in-indonesia-15685/ |title=Food For The Hungry, Phoenix Officials Assess Relief Programs in Indonesia |publisher=Global.christianpost.com |date=2005-05-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, FH has consolidated its U.S. and international operations, led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

=== Evolution of FH's work ===
When Larry Ward founded FH, it was the result of his hurting heart for the 12,000 children who were then dying of hunger related causes.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/food_hungry |title=The Food for the Hungry Story |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant relief theory of the day was that poverty was caused by a lack of resources, so providing resources was the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askquestions.tv/category/speakers/keith-wright/ |title=Keith Wright - Redux |publisher=Askquestions.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward left his position as executive vice president and overseas director at [[World Vision]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/world-vision-international-inc |title=World Vision International, Inc.: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed out to help impoverished people by taking to Haiti resources he had purchased with his personal credit card.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations" /&gt;

FH's first official response was to help returnees of war in the newly forming nation of [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) in 1971. The focus on relief operations continued into the late 1970s, although many of those countries became areas where FH helped the people recover through long-term development projects.

'''Disaster Responses that became Development Areas in 1970s'''

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Year !! Location !! Disaster
|-
| 1971 || Bangladesh || Returnees of war
|-

|-
| 1976 || Guatemala || Earthquake victims
|-
| 1978 || Philippines || Refugees of war
|-
| 1979 || Dominican Republic || Hurricane victims
|}

Beginning in 1978, FH began to more intentionally increase its development work. This is when FH first began working in countries without first responding to a humanitarian disaster, through its [[child sponsorship]] program. The child sponsorship&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; program was launched in 1978 in [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Philippines]]. Additional fields that were added in the 1980s included [[Peru]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Uganda]].

'''Growth of Development Areas in the 1980s'''

| FH Peru || Child Development
|-
| FH Ethiopia || [[Drought]] victims
|-
| FHDR || Haiti border
|-
| FH Mozambique || Civil war victims
|-
| FH Uganda || AIDS &amp; Civil war victims
|}

Throughout the early 1990s, a greater emphasis on the community began to emerge as the focus for development. At the same time, conflicts such as [[terrorism]], [[genocide]] and communist rebel activity were on the rise. FH developed a concise set of development principles focused on transforming communities by working closely with the churches, leaders and families. Over time, new and existing areas of operation would increasingly focus on addressing the whole of the community as an essential approach to serving the most vulnerable. Several fields of operation were added in the 1990s under this principle.

The first ten years of the 21st century would prove to be challenging yet provide new opportunities to adapt to developing global realities. Challenges came through several major emergencies that were added to the ongoing issues of hunger, poverty, HIV/AIDS and war.&lt;ref name="Fex profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fex.ennonline.net/5/agencyprofile |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; ENN |publisher=Fex.ennonline.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|}

Beginning in 1997 FH began implementing the innovative model of Cascade Groups into their developmental structure and programming. They have since been considered a leader and expert in the facilitation of these groups through their diligence and successful execution.

Cascade Groups uses of the idea of [[social networking]] to work in communities. Within this model, groups of 10-15 community-based [[volunteering|volunteers]] educate their neighbors about health issues. The volunteer educators regularly meet together with FH staff for training and supervision. Each of the volunteers meets regularly with 10-15 of her neighbors to share what she has learned and to facilitate behavior change at the household level. This not only creates a multiplying effect, but it also provides the structure for a community health information system that reports on new pregnancies, births and deaths.

Since the Cascade Group model was first pioneered, it has been used by 20 (and counting) other Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in more than 20 countries, largely through the support of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]. In particular, the USAID Child Survival and Health Grants Program and the USAID [[Food for Peace]] (Title II Food Security) Program have helped to fund programs using the Cascade Group model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caregroupinfo.org/blog/criteria |title=Definition &amp; Criteria |publisher=Care Group Info |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implementation of Child-focused Community Transformation (CFCT) in the 2010s'''

FH developed the concept of CFCT between 2005 and 2011 and officially launched CFCT as a unified model for community transformation with child-focused outcomes at the center of field implementation and the organization's strategic plan. Since September 2011, CFCT has formed the base of all Food for the Hungry program models. A core component of Food for the Hungry's mission is to "focus on the most vulnerable," with children believed to be the most prominent and vulnerable members of the communities Food for the Hungry serves. Child-focused does not mean that all development activity is centered solely on children, since children are supported and cared for by their families and community leaders. Therefore, the majority of CFCT activities are focused on strengthening families, the church, and community leaders. "Transformation" encompasses the process of radical change in behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and worldviews of individuals, communities, and cultures toward living in healthy relationship with God, others, themselves, and creation (Four Key Relationships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=Bryant L.|title=Walking with the poor : principles and practices of transformational development|date=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, N.Y.|isbn=978-1570759390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "transformational development" refers to the work that Food for the Hungry staff and community members do to achieve mutual transformation and advance and accelerate measurable well-being improvements for the most vulnerable.

=== Organizational Structure ===
Food for the Hungry, Inc. (FH/US) was incorporated by Larry Ward in the United States in 1971 and has existed continuously since then. Ward incorporated Food for the Hungry International (FHI) in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1980. FHI was part of Ward's dream to implement unified relief and development programs worldwide through an international partnership of supporting national organizations (NOs) or affiliates.

FH/US became a supporting NO for FHI, along with like NOs in Japan (established in 1981), [[Canada]] (established in 1988), [[Sweden]] (established in 1988), [[Switzerland]] (established in 1988), [[Korea]] (established in 1989), [[United Kingdom]] (established in 1989) and a second organization in the United States, Korea-American Food for the Hungry International (established in 2002).&lt;ref name="Fex profile" /&gt;

In 2006, FH restructured to align operations with NOs in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States as members of FH Association (FHA), which was registered in Switzerland in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/food-hungry-association-fh |title=Food for the Hungry Association (FH) &amp;#124; GPPlatform |publisher=Gpplatform.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan and Korea aligned as Food for the Hungry International Federation (FHF) and, though loosely affiliated as members of a larger FHI "family," operate separately from FHA.&lt;ref&gt;https://vocf.net/uploaded_project/fhifdir07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FH is the umbrella for all FHA NOs and relief and development fields. Field work occurs primarily in Asia, Africa, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/work/countries |title=Work &amp;#124; Countries &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOs support this work by raising funds, supplying human resources and helping to design and evaluate field programs.

FH is governed by a unified Board of Directors providing direct oversight of FHA and FH/US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/leadership/board |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

== Biblical Holism ==

A [[Christian worldview|biblical worldview]] is both a foundation and umbrella for FH's work. Food for the Hungry's Statement of Faith&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt; corresponds to the Statement of Faith of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.net/about-us/statement-of-faith |title=Statement of Faith |publisher=Nae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FH functions on the belief that poverty is the result of broken relationships: (1) between humans and humans, (2) between humans and creation and (3) between humans and God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fh.org/2012/08/biblical-worldview/ |title=Biblical Worldview: Both a Foundation and an Umbrella - Food for the Hungry Blog |publisher=Blog.fh.org |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoring these relationships in a holistic way is the key to overcoming poverty.

FH is not affiliated with any specific church or denomination, and its work is available to the world's most vulnerable people, regardless of race, gender or religion. While staff do not proselytize (use religious coercion or require a beneficiary to listen to a religious message before receiving help), biblical values infuse FH programs by promoting concepts that mend the broken relationships that result in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/organizations/food-for-the-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Berkleycenter.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global FH partnership is committed to transformational development. This requires walking with churches, leaders and families to help them identify and overcome the issues that lock them in poverty. One of these issues is fatalistic worldviews that steal people's hope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130215215831/http://dinkumfiles.com/2009/07/07/eastern-university-to-host-transformational-development-conference-august-7th-9th/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations acknowledge that faith can be vital in development, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/partnership-opportunities/faith-based-community-organizations/history |title=Partnership Opportunities &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2014-07-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Heartbeat ===
In 2014, Food for the Hungry created a revised version of their "Vision, Mission, and Values" called "The Heartbeat of FH." The heartbeat is the values and principles that guide and shape the organization and is composed of values, vision, and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fh.org/about/values-vision-purpose/|title=FH Values, Mission, and Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=Food for the Hungry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Values'''
# We follow Jesus. ''We are ambassadors of Jesus in our thoughts, words, and deeds''.
# Our work is relational. ''We pursue reconciled relationships of grace with those with whom we work, partner, and serve.'' 
# We invest wisely and focus on results. ''We are stewards in God's kingdom and strive to invest all resources to maximize missional impact.'' 
# We serve with humility. ''We recognize the dignity of others and put their interests above our own.''
# We pursue beauty, goodness, and truth. ''We pursue beauty, goodness, and truth.'' 
'''Vision'''

''All forms of human poverty ended worldwide.''

'''Purpose'''

''Together we follow God's call responding to human suffering and graduating communities from extreme poverty.''

== Examples of International Impact ==

=== The Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
FH installed a community water pump in Kamalenge. The community uses the water pump for farming and personal use. Since installation, the water management committee in Kamalenge has managed the water pump. FH also helped families in [[Kateba]] learn about health and nutrition through songs and flipcharts. Villages that FH was able to work in are now free of malnutrition. FH also helped to build a seed multiplication station in Emilingombre so farmers would have more direct access to seeds and seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/08/a-lasting-impact-on-food-security/ |title=A Lasting Impact on Food Security &amp;#124; USAID Impact |publisher=Blog.usaid.gov |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti and the Dominican Republic ===
In 2012, when [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)]] hit [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], FH staff helped families who lost homes, animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/when-the-spotlight-on-disasters-fade-the-work-goes-on-11820/ |title=When the Spotlight on Disasters Fade, the Work Goes on &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
Among several other countries, Food for the Hungry offers child sponsorships to children in [[Ethiopia]]. Sponsoring children in Ethiopia provides children with food, medical care, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/bringing-hope-to-the-hard-places-11847// |title=Bringing Hope to the Hard Places &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, FH reached approximately 84,652 households in Ethiopia. In addition to their work with families, FH helped 180,456 farmers improve access to markets due to road construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Foodaid"&gt;[http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722232838/http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf |date=July 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Mozambique ===
Food for the Hungry worked in Mozambique to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality – especially among children 0–23 months of age and pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caregroupinfo.org/docs/FH_Final_Eval_Report_27Dec2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, FH helped develop 182 Farmer Field and Life Groups in Mozambique with 3,276 people receiving services. Their efforts have helped impact approximately 111,000 people.&lt;ref name="Foodaid" /&gt;
FH's Mozambique Child Survival Project was called one of the world's best examples of what can be achieved at low cost to improve the health of children in high-mortality, low-resource settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry B.

== Funding ==
FH is a charter member in good standing of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; Their audited financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 shows that 35 percent of funding came from the U.S. government, 62 percent from individuals, 3 percent from churches, businesses, and foundations. Of this funding, 83 percent was used on programs, 11 percent on fundraising and 6 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fh_us/docs/2011_annual_report_sm?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 |title=Food for the Hungry 2011 Annual Report by Food for the Hungry |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 2012, Food for the Hungry was one of hundreds of non-profits chosen by the [[IRS]] for a routine audit of their tax return for 2007. They cooperated fully with the IRS. A preliminary letter listed several issues that IRS wanted to clarify. That letter was illegally leaked to the media, launching a media controversy over unconfirmed facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/gik |title=Gifts-in-Kind &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Food for the Hungry received a letter from the IRS. The letter accepted the tax return as originally submitted, and acknowledged that Food for the Hungry had followed all laws and accepted accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|website=www.fh.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505182100/https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As charter members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], Food for the Hungry are in compliance with their Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship. In addition, the organization has received [https://www.guidestar.org/profile/95-2680390 GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency], which is the highest level of recognition offered by Guidestar to non-profits and charities. 

There are no outstanding issues concerning Food for the Hungry's involvement in issues with the IRS.

== Accomplishments ==
Food for the Hungry's HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities previously were smaller projects compared to its food distribution and development programs. In 2005, FH was awarded an $8.3 million grant through the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to expand its prevention programs in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mozambique]] and Haiti. This grant is part of a $100-million pool of PEPFAR abstinence funds awarded by USAID through its [[Abstinence]] and Healthy Choices for Youth program in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marina Walker Guevaraemail |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2006/11/30/6400/food-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; Center for Public Integrity |publisher=Publicintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Davis, formerly Chief Program Officer for FH, developed the Barrier Analysis methodology earlier in his career and was a pioneer of the Care Group model, which empowers volunteer peer educators to promote life saving behaviors with mothers at the community level. In 2012, while working with FH, his work earned him the [[American Public Health Association]] Gordon-Wyon Award for Excellence in Community-Oriented Public Health, Epidemiology and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.org/membergroups/sections/aphasections/intlhealth/cbphcw/activities/Gordon+Wyon+Awards.htm |title=Gordon Wyon Awards |publisher=APHA |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[David Evans (administrator)|David Evans]], then U.S. President of Food for the Hungry spoke at the 2012 Faith Suc   vg ncv   n   mmit on AIDS in [[Washington, DC]]. They were recognized for their volunteer efforts like transporting water, washing clothes, bathing those in need, counseling, and praying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/faith-summit-on-aids-receives-accolades-11034/ |title=Faith Summit on AIDS Receives Accolades &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Sports Initiatives ===
In the 2010s, Food for the Hungry began partnering with several [[Major League Baseball]] players and cultural icons. This culminated in the creation of two sports campaigns, Striking Out Poverty in 2016, which partners with players in the [[MLB]], and FH Champions in 2017, which focuses on partnerships with players in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Striking Out Poverty (also known as "K Poverty" or "SOP") began with a focus on ending poverty in nine communities in the [[Dominican Republic]], where baseball is the national sport and more than 500 baseball players in the MLB hail from the Dominican Republic. Food for the Hungry's Global Ambassador is [[Roberto Clemente Jr.|Roberto Clemente Jr]]., a former pro baseball player and son of [[Roberto Clemente]], the first Latin American player to compile 3,000 hits in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fh.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Roberto-Clemente-Jr-Ambassador.pdf|title=Food for the Hungry Names Roberto Clemente Jr. Global Ambassador|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2017|work=Food for the Hungry|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other athletes who have participated in Striking Out Poverty campaigns and vision trips include [[Nick Ahmed]], [[Chase Anderson]], [[Dee Gordon]], [[Yasmani Grandal]], [[Liam Hendriks]], [[Starling Marte]], [[Gregory Polanco]], [[Rob Refsnyder]], [[Moisés Sierra]], [[Adam Wainwright]], and [[Luke Weaver (baseball)|Luke Weaver]]. NFL athletes who have worked with Food for the Hungry formerly as "Pro Player Partners" or as part of Champions by FH include [[Jarvis Jenkins]], [[Jonathan Meeks]], [[Derrick Morgan (American football)|Derrick Morgan]], [[Coty Sensabaugh]], and [[Michael Thomas (defensive back)|Michael Thomas]].

=== Artists and Influencers ===
Food for the Hungry also partners with Christian artists and influencers including [[TobyMac]], [[Lecrae]], [[Switchfoot]], [[Third Day]] and more as part of its Artists Program to promote Food for the Hungry at their concerts and events around the country. Each artists sponsors his or her own child with Food for the Hungry as part of their shared God-given mission with FH to end extreme poverty.

'''Formal sciences''' are [[formal language]] disciplines concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[robotics]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}   Strictly speaking, formal science is not science but a variety of fundamentally abstract logical systems that are applied to both the natural world and human constructs.  Whereas the [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s seek to characterize [[physical systems]] and [[social system]]s, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences are language [[tools]] concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by [[sign systems]]. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures the latter use to describe the world, and what inferences may be made about them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==History==
Formal sciences began before the formulation of the [[scientific method]], with the most ancient [[Mathematics|mathematical]] texts dating back to 1800&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Babylonian mathematics]]), 1600&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Egyptian mathematics]]) and 1000&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Indian mathematics]]). From then on different cultures such as the Indian, [[Greek mathematics|Greek]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab and Persian]] made major contributions to mathematics, while the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese]], independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition.

Besides mathematics, [[logic]] is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: [[Indian logic|India]] from the {{nowrap|6th century BC}}, [[Logic in China|China]] in the {{nowrap|5th century BC}}, and Greece between the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} and the {{nowrap|1st century BC}}. The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of [[Aristotelian logic]], which was then further developed by [[logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logicians]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian tradition also continued into the [[early modern period]]. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond [[Ancient history|antiquity]], though Indian logic was later adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] China.

As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed into a relatively advanced level. [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] (1654), and [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1657) started the earliest study of [[probability theory]]. In the early 1800s, [[Gauss]] and [[Laplace]] developed the mathematical theory of [[statistics]], which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new [[mathematical science]]s and engineering disciplines such as [[operations research]] and [[systems engineering]]. These sciences benefited from basic research in [[electrical engineering]] and then by the development of [[Computer|electrical computing]], which also stimulated [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]] ([[scientific computing]]), and [[theoretical computer science]]. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of [[mathematical logic]], which included the [[theory of computation]].

==Differences from other forms of science==
{{quote|One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.|[[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]], for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.  

Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not a science.  It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at the real things, information and thoughts that we experienced.  As [[Francis Bacon]] pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature.  Formal science is a method that is helpful to science but cannot replace science.

Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds – whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, [[general relativity]] or [[evolutionary biology]], do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of [[axioms]] and [[definitions]] from which other statements ([[theorems]]) are deduced. In other words, theories in formal sciences contain no [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic statements]]; all their statements are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21686">'''German studies''' is the field of [[humanities]] that researches, documents, and disseminates [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], [[German history]], and [[German politics]] in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are {{lang|de|Germanistik}}, {{lang|de|Deutsche Philologie}}, and {{lang|de|Deutsche Sprachwissenschaft und Literaturwissenschaft}}. In English the terms '''Germanistics''' or '''Germanics''' are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as ''German studies'', ''German language and literature'', or ''German philology''.

Modern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines:  German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.

==German linguistics==

German linguistics is traditionally called [[philology]] in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists{{vague|date=September 2012}}. It is roughly divided as follows:
* [[Old High German]] (''Althochdeutsch'') 8th – 11th centuries
* [[Middle High German]] (''Mittelhochdeutsch'') 11th – 14th centuries
* [[Early New High German]] (''Frühneuhochdeutsch'') 14th – 17th centuries
* [[Modern German]] ([[Standard German]], [[German dialectology]]) 18th – 21st centuries

In addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).

==German literature studies==

The study [[German literature]] is divided into two parts: {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} ''Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft'' deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by ''Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft''. The field systematically examines German literature in terms of [[genre]], [[wikt:form|form]], [[Content (media and publishing)|content]], and [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch.  Important areas include [[edition philology]], [[history of literature]], and [[textual interpretation]].  The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-14-051363-9}}) is printed in English but contains many [[German-language]] literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of [[literary criticism]]; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by [[English-language]] critics and scholars.

== German teacher education ==
At least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the left navigation at the web page of one of the [[Cologne University]] German studies institutes at http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linguistics]] of [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|Sprachwissenschaft}}'')
* German language and literature of up to about 1750 (''{{lang|de|Ältere Sprache und Literatur}}'')
* German language and literature since approximately 1750 (''{{lang|de|Neuere Literaturwissenschaft}}'')
* Specifics of the [[didactics]] of teaching German (''{{lang|de|Fachdidaktik}}'')
Several universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called "''{{lang|de|Deutsch (Lehramt)}}''". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the [[federal states of Germany]] cultural authorities, called the ''{{lang|de|[[Staatsexamen]]}}'' ("state exam").

==German media studies==
In recent years{{when|date=September 2012}}, German{{who|date=September 2012}} has looked for links with the fields of [[communication]]s, [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]].  In addition, the sub-branch of [[film studies]] has established itself.

==History==

As an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to [[Tacitus]]' ''Germania''. The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval [[Bible]] translations, were all undertaken during the [[German Renaissance]] of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies.  As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by  [[Georg Friedrich Benecke]], the [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[Karl Lachmann]].

Released in 2016, '''Guess the Correlation''' is a minimalistic [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[game with a purpose]] developed by Omar Wagih at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]].&lt;ref name=Yong&gt;{{cite news |title=The 8-Bit Game That Makes Statistics Addictive |author=Ed Yong |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/the-8-bit-game-that-makes-statistics-addictive/475848/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]] |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wagih&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guessthecorrelation.com|title=Guess the Correlation|author=Omar Wagih|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed to study human perception in scatter plots.&lt;ref name=Tarran&gt;{{cite news |title=A game about correlations that's more than just fun |author=Brian Tarran |url=https://www.statslife.org.uk/the-statistics-dictionary/2675-a-game-about-correlations-that-s-more-than-just-fun |newspaper=[[Significance (magazine)|Significance]] |date=9 February 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables and are asked to guess how positively correlated they are. Guesses closer to the real correlation, are rewarded more points. The game features both single and two-player modes and has a retro 8-bit design and sound effects.&lt;ref name=Yong&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Condliffe&gt;{{cite news |title=This 8-Bit Guess-the-Correlation Game Is Way More Fun Than It Should Be |author=Jamie Condliffe |url=https://gizmodo.com/this-8-bit-guess-the-correlation-game-is-way-more-fun-t-1756336680 |newspaper=[[Gizmodo]] |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collected guesses are used to better understand how humans perceive correlations in scatter plots by identifying features within scatter plots, such as outliers, that cause players to over or under estimate the true correlation.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

By 1 February 2016, over 2 million guesses had been collected from 100,000 participants.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

==Gameplay==



In the single-player mode, players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables. The aim is to guess the true [[Pearson correlation coefficient]], where the guess can range from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Players start out with three lives and no points. Guesses made within 0.05 of the true correlation are awarded a life and five points. Guesses made within 0.10 are awarded one point, and guesses over 0.10 are not awarded any points and a life is deducted. The game ends when the player has run out of lives.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

In the two player mode, opponents challenge each other at guessing the true correlation. Once a session has been initiated between two players, both players are presented with the same scatter plot. The player with the closest guess to true correlation is awarded a point. In the event of a draw, no points are awarded to either player. The first player to reach 10 points is declared the winner.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

This '''history by period''' summarizes significant eras in the [[history of the world]], from the ancient world to the present day.

== Ancient history (60,000 BC – 650 AD) ==
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period in which scientists have found the earliest remains of human activity, approximately 60,000 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 650 AD.

The [[Bronze Age]] is the time period in which humans around the world began to use [[bronze]] as a major metal in tools. It is generally accepted as starting around 3600 BC and ending with the advent of iron in 1000 BC.

The [[Iron Age]] is often called Antiquity or the Classical Era, but these periods more commonly refer to only one region. It begins around 1000 BC with the widespread use of [[iron]] in tools. It is often accepted to end at approximately 650 AD, with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations.

Note that BC and BCE refer to the same time period. BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era, and BC for Before Christ. AD is Anno Domini, and CE is Common Era. This is done in order to standardize time periods across the world ([[ISO 8601]]).
*[[Stone Age]] Ended between 6,000 and 2,000 BC (depending on the area; until 1600s European contact in Australia)
*[[History of Mesopotamia]] 6000 BC - 1100 BC
*[[Indus Valley Civilization]] 3300 BC - 1300 BC

*[[Six Dynasties]] (China, 220 AD–581 AD)
**[[Three Kingdoms]] (China, 220–280)
*[[Late Antiquity]] (Europe, circa 300 AD - circa 476 AD)

== Postclassical Era (500 – 1500) ==
{{main article|Postclassical Era}}
The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for [[Europe]], the [[Middle Ages]], begins around 500 CE after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of [[Islam]].

'''In situ chemical reduction''' (ISCR) is a new type of [[environmental remediation]] technique used for soil and/or [[groundwater remediation]] to reduce the concentrations of targeted environmental contaminants to acceptable levels.  It is the mirror process of [[In situ oxidation|In Situ Chemical Oxidation]] (ISCO). ISCR is usually applied in the environment by injecting chemically reductive additives in liquid form into the contaminated area or placing a solid medium of chemical reductants in the path of a contaminant plume.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ada/gw/iscr.html&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to remediate a variety of organic compounds, including some that are resistant to natural degradation.

The ''in situ'' in ISCR is just Latin for "in place", signifying that ISCR is a chemical reduction reaction that occurs at the site of the contamination. Like ISCO, it is able to decontaminate many compounds, and, in theory, ISCR could be more effective in ground water remediation than ISCO.

Chemical reduction is one half of a [[redox]] reaction, which results in the gain of electrons. One of the reactants in the reaction becomes oxidized, or loses electrons, while the other reactant becomes reduced, or gains electrons. In ISCR, reducing compounds, compounds that accept electrons given by other compounds in a reaction, are used to change the contaminants into harmless compounds.

==History==
ISCR is a relatively new type of ground water remediation technology. The most work on this method of remediation has been done in the past 10–15 years, so there are still many gaps in the understanding of the chemistry behind this process. The development of ISCR started out when K.H. Sweeny conducted research with zero-valent copper and iron in the late 1970s. He was able to treat a number of different chlorinated substances such as [[DDT]], [[endrin]], [[chloroform]], and [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]] to name a few. His work has been the basis of ISCR today.&lt;ref name=technical&gt;{{Cite conference  | first = R.A.  | last = Brown |author2=Lewis, R.L |author3=Fiacco, J. |author4=Leahy, M.C  | title = The technical basis for in situ chemical reduction  | booktitle = Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds  | publisher = Battelle Press  | date = May 2006  | location = Columbus, OH  | isbn = 1-57477-157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Gillham, Tratnyek, Kriegman, Zhang, and Batchelor all made significant contributions in testing different metals and oxides for the use of ISCR.&lt;ref name=presentation/&gt; Gillham and Tratnyek in particular applied the reductive chemistry to groundwater treatment with the emplacement of ZVI barriers. Although it has been shown that other metals like aluminum and magnesium can produce the same effect in the laboratory, ground water treatment most generally focuses on the use of iron.&lt;ref name=technical/&gt; Other major contributions in this field includes Zhang, who researched nanoscale iron, and Batchelor, who researched zero-valent iron clay (ZVI Clay). This past decade, more aspects of ISCR have been researched and new methods of implementation, such as ZVI clay and emulsified ZVI (EZVI), have been created. Scientists have also found that certain iron minerals, like green rust, magnetite, and pyrite, also have reductive capabilities although they contain ferrous iron rather than ZVI.&lt;ref name=presentation/&gt;

==Reductants==

===Zero valent metals (ZVMs)===
{{Main|Zerovalent iron}}
Zero Valent Metals are the main reductants used in ISCR. The most common metal used is iron, in the form of ZVI (zero valent iron), and it is also the metal longest in use. However, some studies show that zero valent zinc (ZVZ) could actually be up to ten times more effective at eradicating the contaminants than ZVI.&lt;ref name=zvz&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Cheng  | first = S.F  |author2=Wu, S.C  | title = The enhancement methods for the degradation of TCE byzero-valent metals  | journal = Chemosphere  | volume = 41| issue = 8  | pages = 1263–1270  | year = 2000  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V74-40D60YB-S&amp;_user=925913&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2000&amp;_rdoc=22&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_srch=doc-info%28%23toc%235832%232000%23999589991%23197376%23FLA%23display%23Volume%29&amp;_cdi=5832&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=28&amp;_acct=C000048262&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=925913&amp;md5=f0791aff9588607e864a0f994645f51e&amp;searchtype=a  | issn = 0045-6535  | doi = 10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00530-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some applications of ZVMs are to clean up [[Trichloroethylene]] (TCE) and [[Hexavalent chromium]] (Cr(VI)).&lt;ref name=tarr&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Tratnyek  | first = P.G. |author2=Scherer, M.M. |author3=Johnson, T.L. |author4=Matheson, L.J.  | title = Chemical Degradation Methods for Wastes and Pollutants: Environmental and Industrial Applications  | publisher = MARCEL DEKKER, INC.  | location = Basel, New York  | pages = 374  | isbn = 978-0-8247-4307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZVMs are usually implemented by a [[permeable reactive barrier]]. For example, iron that has been embedded in a swellable, organically modified [[silica]] creates a permanent soft barrier underground to capture and reduce small, organic compounds as groundwater passes through it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Nanotechnology:_Applications_for_Environmental_Remediation/cat/Application/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron minerals===
There are also many iron minerals that can actively be used in dechlorination. These minerals use {{chem|Fe|2+}}. Particular minerals that can be used include [[green rust]], [[magnetite]], [[pyrite]], and [[glauconite]].&lt;ref name=presentation&gt;{{Cite conference  | first = Brown  | last = R.A.  | title = State of the Practice in In Situ Biogeochemical Reduction Transformations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most reactive of the iron minerals are the [[iron sulfide]]s and [[iron oxide|oxides]]. Pyrite, an iron sulfide, is able to dechlorinate [[carbon tetrachloride]] in suspension. These substances are very interesting because they are naturally present, and learning about how they produce reductive zones could lead to the development of better reductants for ISCR.&lt;ref name=technical/&gt;

===Polysulfides===
[[Polysulfides]] are compounds that have chains of sulfur atoms. This is a relatively new reactant, but it has been tested on the field in treating TCE and in comparison to EHC. The use of Polysulfides is a type of abiotic reduction and works best in anaerobic conditions where iron (III) is available. The benefit of using polysulfides is that they do not produce any biological waste products; however, the reaction rates are slow and they require more time to create the DVI (dual valent iron) minerals that are needed for the reduction to occur.&lt;ref name=casestudy&gt;Svendsen, B. G., D. Brown, and E. Dmitrovic. "Chemical Reduction of TCE with EHC and Calcium Polysulfide." http://www.adventusgroup.com/pdfs/presentations/Chemical%20Reduction%20of%20TCE%20with%20EHC%20and%20Calcium%20Polysulfide.pdfERM. Keynote.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dithionite===
[[Dithionite]] ({{chem|S|2|O|4|2-}}) can also be used as a reductant. It is usually used in addition to iron reduce contaminants. A number of reactions take place and eventually the contaminant is removed. In the process, ditionite is consumed and the final product of all the reactions is 2 sulfur dioxide anions. The dithionite is not stable for a long period of time.

===Bimetallic materials===
{{Main|Zerovalent iron#Bimetallic combinations}}
[[bimetal|Bimetallic materials]] are materials that are made out of two different metals or alloys that are tightly bonded together. A good example of a bimetallic material would be a [[bimetallic strip]] which is used in some kinds of thermometers. In ISCR, bimetallic materials are small pieces of metals that are coated lightly with a catalyst such as palladium, silver, or platinum. The catalyst drives a faster reaction and the small size of the particles allows them to effectively move into and remain in the target zone.&lt;ref name=navfac&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Gavaskar  | first = A. |author2=Tatar, L. |author3=Condit, W.  | title = Cost and Performance Report: Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron Technologies for Source Remediation  | pages = 3  | publisher = NACFAC (Naval Facilities Engineering Command)  | url = http://cluin.org/download/remed/cr-05-007-env.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proprietary materials===
One proprietary material present today for ISCR is the EHC technology created by Adventus. This particular product is actually a mixture of carbon, nutrients, and zero-valent iron. The theory behind this product is that the carbon in the mixture will promote bacterial growth in the subsurface. The growing bacteria consume oxygen, which easily accepts electrons, present in the subsurface which increases reducing potential. The growing bacteria also ferment and produce fatty acids that act as electron donors to other bacteria and substances. Adventus uses this combination of biotic and abiotic processes to implement ISCR. EHC is injected as a "slurry" (a mixture that is 15 to 40% solids and weight with the rest being liquid) into the substratum.&lt;ref name=adventus&gt;http://www.adventusgroup.com/products/ehc.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Another material worth mentioning is EZVI (emulsified ZVI) which is a NASA technology. EZVI is used mainly to treat [[halogenated hydrocarbons]] and [[DNAPL]]s. EZVI is nanoscale iron that is placed into a biodegradable oil [[emulsion]]. The emulsion is then injected into the substratum.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, Lew. "Emulsified Zero-Valent Iron (EZZVI." Technology. NASA, n.d. Web. 18 Mar 2011. &lt;http://technology.ksc.nasa.gov/technology/TOP12246-EZVI.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions in ISCR==

===Reductive processes===
In ISCR, there are many reductive processes that can take place. There are [[hydrogenolysis]], β-elimination, [[hydrogenation]], α-elimination, and [[electron transfer]]. The specific combination of reductive processes that actually take place in the subsurface depends on the species of contaminant that is present and also the type of reduction being used. The natural and biological processes that take place in the substratum also affect the kinds of reductive processes that are found.&lt;ref name=presentation/&gt;

===Surface catalyzed reactions===
{{multiple image
| align      = right
| footer     = &lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;Surface catalyzed reactions&lt;/div&gt;
| image1     = Iron Remediation Reaction Processes.jpg
| width1     = {{#expr: (230 * 366 / 628) round 0}}
| image2     = Iron Remediation Reaction Processes II.jpg
| width2     = {{#expr: (230 * 375 / 592) round 0}}}}

The reactions that occur with permeable reactive barriers and ferrous iron are surface based. The surface reactions take three different forms: direct reduction, electron shunting through ferrous iron, and reduction by production and reaction of hydrogen. Pathway A represents direct electron transfer (ET) for Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to the adsorbed halocarbon (RX) at the metal/water point of contact, resulting in dechlorination and production of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pathway B shows that Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (resulting from corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) may also dechlorinate RX, producing Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pathway C shows that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the anaerobic corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; might react with RX if a catalyst is present.

===Enhancement of reductive pathways===
The reductive processes discussed above can be enhanced in two ways. One is by increasing the amount of usable iron in the subsurface to increase the rate of the reduction by chemical or biological means. The second method is to enhance the reducing ability of the iron by coupling it with other chemical reductants or using biological reduction with it. Using this processes, scientists combined sodium dithionite with iron to treat Chrominum VI and TCE effectively.&lt;ref name=technical/&gt;

Combining bacterial action and biological processes with iron is also known to be effective. The most evident uses of biological processes are with the EZVI technology created by NASA and with the EHC product created by Adventus. Both of these materials have iron within some biological matrix (iron is suspended in vegetable oil in EZVI and in organic carbon in EHC) and use microbial organisms to enhance the reduction zone and to create a more anaerobic environment for the reactions to take place in.

==Implementation==
The most common type of implementation of ISCR is the installation of permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), but there are instances when the reductant can be directly injected into the subsurface to treat source areas.

===Semi-permeable reactive barrier===
{{Main|Permeable reactive barrier}}
These barriers are usually made out of [[ZVI PRB|zero-valent iron]] (ZVI) but can also be made with any other zero-valent metal. The most common way they are made is by filling a trench with ZVI, nanoscale iron, or palladium. Nanoscale iron particles can also be injected directly into the subsurface to treat plumes, and they have large surface areas and, therefore, high reactivities and can be distributed more evenly in the contamination site. Palladium's reaction rates are rapid. The main advantages of PRBs are that it can reduce many a variety of contaminants and it has no above-ground structure. Problems with PRBs include that even with well constructed barriers, there might be the problem of hydraulic short-circuiting.&lt;ref name=serdp&gt;"Chemical oxidation and reduction for chlorinated solvent remediation." In ''In Situ Remediation of Schlorinated Solvent Plumes''; Stroo, H.F.; Ward C.H. (Eds); New York, NY: Springer. pp. 293-294. {{ISBN|978-1-4419-1400-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct injection of reductants===
Nanoscale iron can be directly into the subsurface because they are small enough to be distributed thoroughly. Because the particles are so small, they have a comparatively large reactive surface, providing a more effective reaction. As of now, nanoscale iron is the only material that has been used with this injection strategy, and it is probably the only material that is effective in injection.&lt;ref name=serdpB&gt;{{Cite journal  | title = Chlorinated Solvent Source Zone Initiative  | journal = SERDP and ESTCP Summary Report  | date = November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of ISCR==
ISCR is a relatively new technology, so there much scope for research and improvement. Right now, although the reactions that make up ISCR have been studied extensively, there is not much background on what factors most contribute to the effectiveness of ISCR. One thing that needs to be done is find out exactly what reactions are taking place in the subsurface. ISCR is fairly more complex than ISCO because there are substances in the subsurface that will naturally reduce contaminants. The pathways that a contaminant can go through are consequently more diverse. Also, questions that need to be kept in mind are:&lt;ref name=potential&gt;{{Cite conference  | first = Tratnyek  | last = P.G.  | title = Chemical reductants for ISCR: the potential for improvement  | booktitle = 7th International Conference on Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds  | date = April 21, 2010  | location = Monterey, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Which reducing agent will work best with a particular conaminant?
#How can we improve the ISCR technology that is already commercially available?

[[File:Galerie Colbert.jpg|thumb|The INHA is located in the Colbert Gallery]]
The '''Institut national d'histoire de l'art''' (INHA; National Institute for Art History) is a French research institute, created and governed by Decree No. 2001-621 (July 12, 2001) and situated in [[Paris]].

The Institute develops scientific activity and contributes to international cooperation in most fields of [[art history]] and heritage by exercising research, training and knowledge-diffusion. It is located in the Galerie Colbert in Paris, which houses the Department of Education and Research and the Richelieu Quadrilateral Area. The latter's Labrouste Room houses the Department of Documentation, which holds collections from the Art and Archeology Library founded by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] in 1897 and donated in 1917 to the [[University of Paris]].

The INHA's mission is to promote international art historical research in all fields of the history of art. It pilots a large number of programs by gathering together university researchers and curators. It organises study days, symposiums, conferences and meeting-debates and develops different resources, documentary bases and research programs in art history. Each year, the INHA invites about sixty art historians, among them experienced researchers, academics, curators, art critics and doctoral students. Twice a year, the INHA publishes a scientific review on art history entitled ''Perspective''. Many documentary bases are to be found on the INHA's website.

The institute is located in Paris at 2, Rue Vivienne, in a former 17th century town house converted into a gallery in the 19th century. Its art history library, one of the largest in the world with more than {{formatnum:1700000}} documents, is located in the Labrouste room of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] at 58 rue de Richelieu.

The INHA provides access to external and internal online databases like [https://www.inha.fr/fr/ressources/outils-documentaires/acces-global-et-organise-aux-ressources-en-histoire-de-l-art-agorha.html AGORHA (''Accès global et organisé aux ressources en histoire de l’art'')] which allows several search modes in the different research fields of the INHA: [https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/jsp/portal/index.jsp general search] (or use « ''Rechercher'' » in the bar), [https://www.inha.fr/_contents/ametys-internal%253Asites/inha/ametys-internal%253Acontents/montee-de-version-d-agorha-apercu-des-nouveautes-article/_metadata/content/_data/rBtOsQxW1GywhbJvoKIEvJX4xm3Abz_aOUdCDp3zTWGgSS41vm-XB6J2M1rCTzU33ZVZFIuNerUFNetDEetmaftLiJg7ZKS1Zb0ec2bdC99b9g3gFWlorw-em_EHOCzivIj3CF97 simple search], expert search and search by links, in particular in the RETIF ([https://agorha.inha.fr/inhaprod/ark:/54721/0014 ''répertoire des tableaux italiens dans les collections publiques françaises (XIIIe-XIXe siècles))''] which gives the {{formatnum:13761}} italian paintings held in French public collections.

'''The Institution of Environmental Sciences''' (IES) is a UK professional body leading debate, dissemination and promotion of environmental science and sustainability. The IES has ties with [[higher education]] and promotes and supports environmental sciences and [[sustainable development]] in universities and colleges nationally and internationally.

The IES is a charitable organisation, which raising public awareness of [[environmental science]] by supporting professional scientists and academics working in the area.

IES is a constituent body of both the [[Society for the Environment]] (SocEnv), and the [[Science Council]] which enables IES members to progress  to [[Chartered Environmentalist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socenv.org.uk/members/list-of-member-bodies/|title=Licensed Partners|work=socenv.org.uk|accessdate=2 Jan 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820024214/http://www.socenv.org.uk/members/list-of-member-bodies/|archivedate=2007-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chartered Scientist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencecouncil.org/about-us/our-members-and-licensed-bodies/|title=Licensed Partners|work=sciencecouncil.org/|accessdate=2 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; status

==History==
The Institution of Environmental Sciences was founded as a result of an initiative by Dr John Rose during a series of meetings held during 1971-1972 at the Royal Society in London and chaired by Lord Burntwood.

==Affiliations==
The IES is a member of the [[Society for the Environment]], the [http://www.sciencecouncil.org Science Council] and the [http://www.efaep.org European Network of Environmental Professionals].

The IES provides administration for two sister organisations. The [http://www.ches.org.uk/ Committee of Heads of Environmental Science] who accredit programmes of study in universities and to support and promote the discipline in higher education and the [[Institute of Air Quality Management]].

==Publications==
The IES produces four editions of its journal '''environmental SCIENTIST''' each year. Articles are written by experts and professionals working in the environmental field. Each issue examines a topic of importance to environmental science; an expert in the area acts as guest editor, introducing the articles and providing an overview of the subject at hand.  Previous editions of the journal can be viewed on the [http://www.the-ies.org/environmental_scientist IES website].

The IES produces reports that are available to download from [http://www.the-ies.org/reports the website].

In addition to the journal and reports, the IES produces a monthly newsletter, '''ES News''', focusing on a lighter dissemination of expert knowledge and the sharing of institution news.

==History==
IAML was founded after [[World War II]] to "promote international cooperation and standardization in such matters as [[cataloging]], standards of service, personnel training and the exchange of materials between [[libraries]]."&lt;ref name=Lonn&gt;Anders Lönn, "International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres," The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 12, p. 491. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of IAML was a three-year process from 1949 to 1951. It was part of the [[United Nations]]' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in [[Basel]] and [[Florence]] in 1949, in [[Lüneburg]] in 1950, and in [[Paris]] in 1951, the last one conducted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music Librarianship in the United Kingdom |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Turbet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |date=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=9780754605720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Accademia Nazionale [[Luigi Cherubini]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the [[International Musicological Society]] in 1927, but the [[Second World War]] prevented anything from taking shape.&lt;ref name="Pleßke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleßke|first=Hans-Martin|title=Geschichte und Funktion der Internationalen Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken (IVMB)|journal=Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen|date=1972|volume=86|issue=6|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused heavy losses at many [[libraries]], and international cooperation was of utmost importance. 

The goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Eitner's|de}} ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' ([[Leipzig]], 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for [[Microform|microfilming]] musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to [[Music librarianship#Cataloging and Classification|music cataloging]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]].

In 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The International Association of Music Libraries |journal=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] |first=Thor E. |last=Wood |pages=697–699 |volume=25 |issue=4 |date= June 1959 |jstor=896620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991,&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt; with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.

IAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, [[the International Association of Music Information Centres]] and the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.&lt;ref name=Lonn /&gt;

==Structure==
The IAML board of directors is made up of the [[president]], past president, [[Secretary (club)|secretary general]], [[treasurer]], and [[vice presidents]].&lt;ref name=Meinhold&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Alexandra|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110226379|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.

IAML is affiliated with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), the [[International Music Council]], and the IMS.&lt;ref name=Meinhold /&gt;

==Activities==
IAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the "R projects" of [[musicology]]: ''Répertoire international des sources musicales'' (RISM), ''[[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|Répertoire international de littérature musicale]]'' (RILM), ''Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale'' (RIdIM) and ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the "R projects".&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt;

===Annual Conferences===
IAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.&lt;ref name=Geering&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geering|first=Mireille|title=Geschichte und Gegenwart der AIBM|journal=Forum Musikbibliothek|date=1991|volume=3|pages=197–212.

'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.

Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.

==Synonyms==
Other commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:

* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; 
* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and
* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.

==Benefits==

The US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts
GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:

* Social and economic [[revitalization]]
* Sustainability
* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]
* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores
* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Social and economic revitalization===

Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.

The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.

By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.

===Sustainability===
[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Land recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.

By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.
[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.

===An alternative to sprawl===
Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.

Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.

By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.

Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.

Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.

===Directing development to urban cores===
Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.

===Addressing climate change===
Land recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent &lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.

{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.

==Challenges==
While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:

* market factors
* environmental-liability risks
* uncertainty and cost
* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements
* difficulty in obtaining project financing
* the lure of greenfields

===Market factors===
As the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.

====Greenfields competition====
Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.

===Brownfields===
As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is “real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant”. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

====Uncertainty and costs====
Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.

====Project financing====
Obtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.

===Environmental-liability risks===
Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or “mothball” a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.

====Regulatory requirements====
The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">In [[Social Science]], '''Methodological Nationalism''' is a term used to describe  an intellectual orientation and pattern in scholarly research that conceives of the nation-state as the sole unit of analysis or as a container for social processes. This term has been greatly developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define '''methodological nationalism''' as "understood as the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological nationalism and beyond: nation-state building, migration and the social sciences|journal=Global Networks 2|volume=2|issue=4|pages=301–334|url=http://www.suz.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:1296e4ec-3ca6-4efe-b083-163b9b649bab/Text_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and the interdisciplinary field of [[migration studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as [[Saskia Sassen]], who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the "terrains of the global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=The global inside the national A research agenda for sociology|url=http://www.saskiasassen.com/pdfs/publications/the-global-inside-the-national.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three types of methodological nationalism ==

Per Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological Nationalism and Migration Studies ==

'''Methodological Nationalism''' and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized  in numerous studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayall|first1=James|title=Nationalism and international society|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0521389617|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and modernism : a critical survey of recent theories of nations and nationalism|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415063418|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the historical prevalence of '''methodological nationalism''' within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have  "conflated the necessary
conceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the
nation-state’s diminishing relevance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chernilo|first1=Daniel|title=The critique of methodological nationalism|journal=Thesis Eleven|date=August 2011|volume=106|issue=1|pages=98–117|doi=10.1177/0725513611415789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, research on  [[transnationalism]] and [[transmigrants]] has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of '''methodological nationalism''' as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quayson|first1=Ato|last2=Daswani|first2=Girish|title=A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism|date=September 2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8826-5|pages=600|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-140518826X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.

Research on transnational Latina motherhood has negotiated issues of the nation-state as well as transnationalism. The conceptual frameworks of power geometries, social location, and geographic scales is positiojed to counteract the analytical tendency to fall back on methodological nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pessar |first= Patricia |title= Transnational Migration: Bringing Gender in |date=June 1971 |publisher= Center for Migration Studies of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boehm |first=Deborah |title="For My Children:" Constructing Family and Navigating the State in the U.S.-MexicoTransnation |date=Fall 2003 |publisher= George Washington University for Ethnographic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly research has combined transnational migration studies and conceptual frameworks such as [[coloniality of power]] to avoid '''methodological nationalism''' and better account for the intersecting transnational phenomena that constitutes the experiences of [[transmigrants]] and better explains the processes of transnational migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Cervantes-Rodríguez, Margarita |last2=Grosfoguel,|first2=Ramón |last=Mielants |first=Eric |title=Caribbean migration to Western Europe and the United States essays on incorporation, identity, and citizenship|date=2009|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781592139569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Sujata|title=Colonial Modernity and Methodological Nationalism in Sociology of India |website= vimeo.com/34815428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microecosystems''' can exist in locations which are precisely defined by critical [[Natural environment|environmental]] factors within small or tiny spaces.

Such factors may include [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[chemical]] milieu, [[nutrient]] supply, presence of symbionts or solid substrates, gaseous atmosphere ([[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] or [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]]) etc.

==Some examples==
===Pond microecosystems===
These microecosystems with limited [[water]] volume are often only of temporary duration and hence colonized by organisms which possess a drought-resistant [[spore]] stage in the lifecycle, or by organisms which do not need to live in water continuously. The ecosystem conditions appliying at a typical pond edge can be quite different from those further from shore. Extremely space-limited water ecosystems can be found in, for example, the water collected in [[bromeliad]] leaf bases and the "pitchers" of ''[[Nepenthes]]''.

===Soil microecosystems===
A typical soil microecosystem may be restricted to less than a millimeter in its total depth range owing to steep variation in humidity and/or atmospheric gas composition. The soil grain size and physical and chemical properties of the substrate may also play important roles. Because of the predominant solid phase in these systems they are notoriously difficult to study microscopically without simultaneously disrupting the fine spatial distribution of their components.

===Terrestrial hot-spring microecosystems===
These are defined by gradients of water temperature, nutrients, dissolved gases, [[salt]] concentrations etc. Along the path of terrestrial water flow the resulting temperature gradient continuum alone may provide many different minute microecosystems, starting with thermophilic bacteria such as [[Archaea]] "Archaebacteria" (100+ °C), followed by conventional [[thermophiles]] (60–100 °C), [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) such as the motile filaments of ''Oscillatoria'' (30–60 °C), [[protozoa]] such as Amoeba, [[rotifers]], then [[green algae]] (0–30 °C) etc.
Of course other factors than temperature also play important roles. Hot springs can provide classic and straightforward ecosystems for microecology studies as well as providing a haven for hitherto undescribed organisms.

===Deep-sea microecosystems===
The best known contain rare specialized organisms, found only in the immediate vicinity (sometimes within centimeters) of underwater [[volcanic vent]]s (or "smokers"). These ecosystems require extremely advanced diving and collection techniques for their scientific exploration.

===Closed microecosystem===
One that is sealed and completely independent of outside factors, except for temperature and light. A good example would be a plant contained in a sealed jar and submerged under water. No new factors would be able to enter this ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">The '''Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES)''' is a research network for environmental studies based primarily in the humanities. By organizing regular conferences, symposia and workshops, NIES aims to create opportunities for researchers in the [[Nordic countries]] who address environmental questions to exchange ideas and develop their work in various interdisciplinary contexts. Fields represented by members of the network include [[Ecocriticism]], [[Environmental history]], [[Environmental philosophy]], [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[Art history]], [[Media studies]], [[Ecological economics]], [[Human Geography]], [[Cultural studies]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archeology]], [[Sustainability Studies]], [[Education for Sustainability]] and [[Landscape Studies]].

NIES is responsible for organizing and editing the research series '''''Studies in the Environmental Humanities (SEH)''''' published by [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]].

Formed in 2007, NIES was originally a cooperation among small academic groups in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Today, it includes more than 100 researchers from all the [[Nordic countries]].  The network actively sponsors a wide range of educational initiatives, research projects and public outreach activities and is a key partner in pan-European and other international initiatives to build capacity and foster theoretical advancement in the Environmental Humanities. Since January 2011, the network's primary anchoring institution is Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden. National anchoring institutions include University of Turku, University of Oslo, University of Iceland, Uppsala University and University of Southern Denmark. The network's current phase of operations (2011–2015) is supported by NordForsk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11623">The '''pizza effect''' is a term used especially in [[religious studies]] and [[sociology]] for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; It is named after the idea that modern [[pizza]] toppings were developed among [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]] [[History of immigration to the United States|in the United States]] (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in [[Italian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="dandavats"/&gt;

Related phrases include "hermeneutical feedback loop", "re-enculturation", and "self-orientalization". The term "pizza effect" was coined by the Austrian-born [[Hindu]] [[Dashanami Sampradaya|monk]] and professor of Anthropology at [[Syracuse University]], [[Agehananda Bharati]]&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name=knott/&gt;&lt;ref name="dandavats"&gt;[[Steven J.

== Examples ==
The original examples given by Agehananda Bharati mostly had to do with popularity and status:
*The [[Apu trilogy]] films of [[Satyajit Ray]], which were flops in India before they were given prizes in [[Western countries]] and re-evaluated as classics of the [[Indian cinema]]&lt;ref name="expat"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The popularity in India of movements like those of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and [[ISKCON]] based on their popularity in the west&lt;ref name="expat" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The exalted status of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in Hinduism, where, although it was always highly regarded, it gained its current prominence only following Western attempts to identify a single canonical "Hindu Bible"&lt;ref name="ab70" /&gt;

Analyst [[Mark Sedgwick]] wrote that [[Islamist terrorism]], and specifically [[suicide bombing]], can be seen as examples, beginning as isolated interpretations of the concept of [[shahid]], or martyrdom, then being re-exported to the greater Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Day of the Dead]] parade in Mexico City was inspired by an event in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', which was fictional at the time of the film's production. &lt;ref&gt;David Agren, October 30, 2016, The Gaurdian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/day-of-the-dead-parade-james-bond-mexico-city Mexico City's James Bond-inspired Day of the Dead parade gets mixed reviews], retrieved October 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], from where they spread their views within India.&lt;ref name="knott"&gt;{{citation | year=2000 | title = Hinduism: a very short introduction | author1=Kim Knott | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-285387-5 | page=78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8XK_GU9icC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Buddhist modernism]] or "Protestant Buddhism" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, "mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product", and they in turn influenced [[Sri Lankan Buddhist]] [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.&lt;ref name="blackships"&gt;

According to scholar Kim Knott, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] "was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in English in [[Sir Edwin Arnold]]'s translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook."&lt;ref name="knott" /&gt;

''One Into Many: Translation and the Dissemination of Classical Chinese Literature'' (Issue 18 of Approaches to translation studies). [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2003. Start page 39. {{ISBN|9042008156}}, 9789042008151. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fact there had been interest in translating the novel into English "gave life and fame" to ''Haoqiu zhuan'' and therefore affected its standing in China.&lt;ref name="StAndrep39" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for "…the renewed interest in the four [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]], as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts," and that due to this interest, "Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1981| author1 = Miller | first1 = D.| jstor = 40014933| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| issue = 2| pages = 186–198| title = Sources of Hindu Ethical Studies_ a Critical Review| journal = The Journal of Religious Ethics| volume = 9| doi = 10.2307/40014933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Scholar Jørn Borup wrote about an "inverted pizza-effect", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including [[Martin Heidegger]] "appear to have been significantly inspired by [[Eastern thought]] - an Eastern thought itself presented through "[[Protestant]]" or [[Western culture|"Western" eyes]]. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in [[religious studies]], where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2004 | title = Zen and the Art of Inverting Orientalism | author1=Jørn Borup | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-017698-X | page=477 | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110211702.3.451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced [[American cuisine]]: "...pizza-loving American tourists, [[Tourism in Italy|going to Italy]] in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed [[pizzeria]]s to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of "authentic" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of "authentic" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted."&lt;ref name="blackships" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin,  etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22684">{{short description|The relationship between plants and animals and a polar environment}}
'''Polar ecology''' is the relationship between plants and animals in a polar environment. Polar environments are in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. Arctic regions are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and it contains land and the islands that surrounds it. [[Antarctica]] is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and it also contains the land mass, surrounding islands and the ocean. [[Polar region]]s also contain the subantarctic and [[subarctic]] zone which separate the polar regions from the [[temperate region]]s. Antarctica and the Arctic lie in the [[polar circle]]s. The polar circles are not visible on the earth but it is shown on maps to be the areas that receives less sunlight due to less radiation. These areas either receive sunlight ([[midnight sun]]) or shade ([[polar night]]) 24 hours a day because of the [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|earth's tilt]]. Plants and animals in the polar regions are able to withstand living in harsh weather conditions but are facing environmental threats that limit their survival.

==Climate==
{{see also|Polar meteorology}}
[[Polar climate]]s are cold, windy and dry. Because of the lack of [[precipitation]] and low temperatures the Arctic and Antarctic are considered the world's largest [[desert]]s or [[Polar desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/records/largest-desert.shtml The World's Largest Deserts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/types/ Types of Seserts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[radiation]] from the sun that is received is reflected off the snow making the polar regions cold.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 23&lt;/ref&gt; When the radiation is reflected, the heat is also reflected. The polar regions reflect 89-90% of the sun radiation that the earth receives.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 24&lt;/ref&gt; And because Antarctica is closer to the sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]], it receives 7% more radiation than the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/152724/ Factors affecting surface ultraviolet radiation levels in the Arctic]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the polar region, the atmosphere is thin. Because of this the [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]] that gets to the atmosphere can cause fast [[sun tanning]] and [[Photokeratitis|snow blindness]].

Polar regions are dry areas; there is very little precipitation due to the cold air. There are some times when the [[humidity]] may be high but the [[water vapor]] present in the air may be low. Wind is also strong in the polar region. [[Wind]] carries snow creating [[blizzard]] like conditions. Winds may also move small organisms or vegetation if it is present.&lt;ref name="stone44"&gt;Stonehouse, 44&lt;/ref&gt; The wind blows the snow making [[snowdrift]]s or snow dunes which may exist even in the spring when the snow is thawing out.&lt;ref name="stone44"/&gt; It is hard for meteorologists to measure the amount of precipitation. This is because it is expensive to take care of the stations that collect weather data and it hard for them to measure snow fall amounts because the wind blows the snow too much to calculate exact amounts.

The temperatures are similar between the Arctic and Antarctic. The temperatures in the Arctic are different depending on the location. Temperatures in the Arctic have a higher range than in the Antarctic. Temperatures can range as much as {{convert|100|C-change|0}}. Along the coast in the Arctic temperatures average {{Convert|-30|to|-40|C}} in December, January and February.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ice melts along the coast during the summer months which are around June, July and August and the temperature may rise a few degrees above freezing causing there to be some vegetation. During these same months in the northern regions there will be 24 hours of daylight. Arctic regions also receive a lot of snowfall. The [[Arctic Basin]] has snow 320 days out of the year while the Arctic Seas have snow cover 260 days a year.&lt;ref name="mel14"/&gt; The thickness of the snow averages {{Convert|30|–|40|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="mel14"&gt;Melnikov, 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greenland]], temperatures have an average temperature of {{convert|-40|C}} in the winter and in the summer the temperatures reach {{Convert|-12|C}}. Iceland on the other hand is in a subarctic region meaning it is near the temperate zone. Because of this the temperatures are above the freezing point throughout much of the year. In Russia temperatures are extremely cold. In [[Verkhoyansk]], Siberia it has reached the coldest temp of {{Convert|-68.8|C}} in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures in the summer in Siberia can get to {{Convert|36|C}}.

In the Antarctic there is less temperature variations. Temperatures only range by around {{Convert|30|C-change|0}}. The winter months are May till September while the summer months will be October till April. The sun reappears in September which then starts the 24 hours of daylight. The temperatures are different between the plateaus in Antarctica and between the coasts. The plateaus are the coldest regions of Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer months there is low precipitation with light winds. [[Vostok Station|Vostok]] has received the lowest temperature worldwide getting as low as {{Convert|-88.3|C}} in 1960. The West Antarctica plateau reaches snow levels of around {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}}. This area is also warmer but it receives the heaviest snow and receives more wind. Because of the cold desert like conditions on the plateaus there are very little plants and animals. Some species of birds though have been seen.

On the coasts in the summer there is more wind, and it is cloudier. Coasts with higher latitudes have a temperature of {{Convert|-24|C}} in the winter months whereas lower latitude coasts get down to {{Convert|-20|C}}. Coastal areas may receive {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} or more of snow.

==Water==
[[Water]] is an important part of human survival. Because of its cold temperature much of the earth's water comes from the polar regions. 90% of the world's water comes from the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic ice cap]] although a lot of this water is not used.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 106&lt;/ref&gt; Water environments are important for many species around the world. Many bacteria thrive there as well as algae and flora.

Many of the ponds or lakes in polar regions are frozen over or snow covered for most of the year. Larger lakes thaw out around the edges during the warmer months while the smaller lakes thaw entirely. There are few rivers in the polar regions. The Arctic has more rivers compared to Antarctica. The regions also have ponds. The ponds that attract birds tend to be rich in nutrients. This is because of the bird droppings or bird feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 109&lt;/ref&gt; There are two different types of lakes in polar regions including Arctic lakes and Antarctic lakes. Of the Arctic lakes they include glacial lakes and permafrost lakes.

The polar regions include the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Southern Ocean]]. The Arctic Ocean covers {{Convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 127&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring the ice covers an area of {{Convert|5000000|-|8000000|km2|abbr=on}} and in the winter it is twice that. In this area it is never totally ice-covered. This is due to the winds breaking up the ice. Because of these cracks in the ice there is more biological productivity in the ocean.

The Southern Ocean is {{Convert|28000000|km2|abbr=on}}. This ocean contains the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]]. The ocean contains large packs of ice that surrounds Antarctica.

==Land==
Because of the cold weather it is hard for plants to grow. Frozen ground covers most of the polar regions for the majority of the year. [[Permafrost]] reaches a thickness of {{Convert|600|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} deep. Large amounts of permafrost can lead to poor water drainage. Due to the permafrost the water in the soil remains frozen for most of the year. In the summer the top of the permafrost may be covered with water due to melting in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering is also common in polar regions. There is rubble from rocks that are scattered on the land due to movement of [[glacier]]s. Also quick temperature change causes weathering.

The main type of soil in the polar regions is ahumic soil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=00v6iF3X4gEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Ahumic+soil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2_LbB1b0v&amp;sig=MqeXHlk65XcGD5L-3ubQDNEHAGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kHh1Uo3jHuKbiAK5qoDADg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ahumic%20soil&amp;f=false Antarctic Soils and Soil Forming Processes: J. C. F. Tedrow, Editor]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the cold desert soil. This soil consists of sand that is frozen. These soils tend to not have a lot of vegetation but [[bacteria]] has been found.

The other type of soil is organic soil. This type of soil is found in areas that are warmer and have more moisture. Some vegetation that lives here are [[algae]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[moss]]es. One type of organic soil is the brown soils, which have drainage.

== Animals ==
Due to the harsh weather in the polar regions, there are not many animals. The animals that do exist in the polar region are similar between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The animals do differ by the temperature. In the Arctic some invertebrates include spiders, mites, mosquitoes and flies. In warmer areas of the polar regions moths, butterflies and beetles can be found. Some of the larger animals that exist are foxes, wolves, rabbits, hares, polar bears, [[Reindeer|reindeer/caribou]]. There are various bird species that have been spotted in the Arctic. Eight species of birds reside on the polar [[tundra]] year round while 150 breed in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The birds that do breed go to the Arctic between May and July. One of the known birds is the [[snowy owl]], which has enough fat on it to be able to survive in the cold temperatures.

In the Antarctic some invertebrates that exist are mites, fleas and ticks. Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a land mammal population.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 105&lt;/ref&gt; There are also no birds that reside in Antarctica. Though, it has been known that various birds from South America have been spotted in Antarctica.

For animals to be able to live in the polar region they have to have adaptations which allow them to live in the cold and windy environments. These animals have originated with these adaptations, and animals that live in these regions are accumulating adaptations to be able to live in this type of environment. Some of these adaptations may be to be big and insolated, have a lot of fur, and to be darker. Also, many animals live in groups to be able to protect themselves from the cold. Animals also tend to be [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] which are animals that maintain a high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;177{{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller invertebrates also tend to be smaller in polar regions which helps them conserve energy.

There are also many different animals that live in the sea water near polar regions. [[Squid]]s are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 202&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. [[Arctogadus glacialis|Arctic cod]] is a major species in the Arctic. [[Halibut]], [[cod]], [[herring]], and [[Alaska pollock]] (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish. In Antarctica there is not a lot of diversity among the fish; there is a lot of the same kind. [[Antarctic silverfish]] and [[lanternfish]] are some examples of fish that live in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pinniped|Seals]] are also found in polar regions and number around 2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 206&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to breed on land in the polar regions. [[Whale]]s are also in the polar regions and can be found near the surfaces of water where they prey.

There are also birds that breed in the polar regions. In the Arctic, 95% of the birds breeding here consist of only four different species. These include the [[northern fulmar]], [[kittiwake]], the [[little auk]] and the [[thick-billed murre]]. These birds breed here when the ice starts to thaw and when there is cracks in the ice so the birds are able to feed. In the Antarctic there are two different birds that live there including the [[penguin]] and the [[procellariiformes]].

== Vegetation ==
There is a wide source of vegetation in the polar region but there are few species in common in the southern and northern polar regions. The Arctic consists of desert and tundra vegetations. The desert vegetation consists of algae, [[lichen]]s, and mosses. Lichens are the most dominant plants. The ground is bare with patchy cover of lichens and mosses.&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Flowering plants are also seen but not as common. It only contains 60 species of flowering plants. The Arctic tundra vegetation also consists of lichens and mosses, but it includes shrubs, [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[forb]]s as well. The amount of vegetation in the tundra consists on how much sun, or snow cover is in the area. The vegetation in this area may grow as tall as {{Convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. In the southern part of the Arctic there tend to be more shrubs whereas the northern parts there is less plant cover. In wet areas of the tundra there is tussock grasses and cotton grasses. In moist areas there are short grasses, mosses, [[willow]]s, and [[birch]]es.

The Antarctic vegetation consists of algae or lichens, and some bacteria and fungi. Mosses and lichens dominate though. The algae and lichens grow where there is moisture, and they hide in cracks to be protected from the wind. The dominate grassland is the tussock. These grasses get to be {{Convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, so they provide habitat for many [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Of the {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=on}} of land that makes up Antarctic, less than 2% of it does not have snow or ice.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstrom, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a type of vegetation is a [[crustose]] lichen. These lichens are found in moist areas that are hidden from wind. They hide on the surface of rocks in the cracks. They survive off the water that melts from above. These lichen occur in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], as well as Greenland and IceLand These lichens can be red or orange colored and are known to defoliate rocks.&lt;ref&gt;72 {{Clarify|date=November 2013|reason=Who is this?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats ==
There exist many threats to the polar regions. One threat is whaling. Whaling started in the 16th century. People hunted whales to sell the meat. By 1925 the number of whales being killed rose from 14,000 to 40,000. The [[International Whaling Commission]] tried to stop whaling in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 192&lt;/ref&gt; but was unsuccessful.

[[Overfishing]] is another threat to the polar regions. In the [[Bering Sea]] there is a lot of fishing due to the high populations of halibut and Alaskan Pollock. Around the 1970s [[krill]] began to become a popular [[crustacean]] to catch. The [[Soviet Union]] started advertising food with krill in it and they started overfishing krill. It has been estimated that 40 tonnes of krill per hour were caught during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the [[exclusive economic zone]] was established. This said that a certain country can fish {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} off the shore. The country is now able to control who fishes in their EEZ area. But the EEZ has been unsuccessful.

Another threat is [[pollution]]. There are many land and water areas within the polar regions that are contaminated. This can be due to the transport of oil by large ships. [[Siberia]] is one example of a place that has had major pollution in its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Nuttall, 529&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion on the [[ozone layer]] is one more threat. An [[ozone hole]] has been detected above Antarctica. The cause of the depletion of the ozone layer is due to [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s and other [[greenhouse gas]]es. The other main reason is due to man made gases that are released into the atmosphere. There are many environmental effects due to this because the gases that are being released five times faster than they are destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming]] is also having effect on the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Global warming is causing the temperature on the earth to increase. In ''Plan B 2.0'' [[Lester R. Brown]] talks about how the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 70&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that the temperature in the Arctic region has increased by {{Convert|3|-|4|C-change|0}} within the last half century. And with the increase in temperatures some worry that this will cause the sea level to rise. Scientists believe that if the [[Greenland ice sheet]] melts then the sea level could rise by {{Convert|23|ft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The melting of this [[ice sheet]] or others could have an effect on [[ocean current]]s. It could cause lower temperatures in northern North America. Rising of the sea level will also impact coastal areas. One example is in [[Bangladesh]]. If there was a {{Convert|1|m|abbr=on}} increase in sea level then millions of people would have to migrate from the coast. Global warming is also affecting Antarctica. The [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] or Larsen A is an ice sheet on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The sheet broke in 1995, and then in 2000 an [[iceberg]] that is {{convert|4250|sqmi|abbr=on}} broke off the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Larsen B, which was {{Convert|5500|km2|abbr=on}}, broke off.

Global warming affects plants and animals. For plants, the warmer temperatures induce stress on the plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand&lt;/ref&gt; For animals, there has been a decrease in the number of [[polar bear]]s in the [[Hudson Bay]] area.&lt;ref name="sti294"/&gt; Since 1981, the polar bear population has been declining. This is because global warming causes the ice to break up faster so the polar bears are going to the coasts when there are poor conditions.&lt;ref name="sti294"&gt;Stirling, 294&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Whoever owns the land is responsible or managing it. And the owners of the land differ between the Antarctic and Arctic and also within the polar regions. In the Arctic, there are six nations that own the land about 60°N. These nations include: Canada, [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[United States|USA]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 193&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Arctic cooperation and politics|international treaties]] set up so there are no disputes. These nations have also have set their government to manage the land properly. They have set up [[national park]]s, [[Wilderness area|land for wilderness]], and also land for research. In the polar regions there have been laws set up to manage the number of visitors. There have been rules set up allowing only a certain amount of mining done and other measures to protect the environment from damages.

In the Antarctic the owners of the land are less clear. Some areas of Antarctica are controlled by the French, while other areas are controlled by [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever owns Antarctic is still unclear therefore many other countries have put out scientific stations. The [[Antarctic Treaty System]] of 1961 was established to make sure all the conflicts were resolved about who owned the land. This and other treaties have shown interest in helping to conserve the Antarctic region. All of these countries have conservation laws. These laws manage the amount of hunting in the area, monitor invasive species, and control burning and settlement.

==Still unexplored?==
In a [[meta-analysis]] of the published work in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s since the term [[biodiversity]] appeared in the bibliography, the Arctic and Antarctic Polar regions were found to still be unexplored. In addition, the north Pacific Ocean (Pacific Northeast and [[Pacific Northwest]]), still has few citations in comparison to its large size. This limits our perception of the world's [[Aquatic biodiversity research|aquatic biodiversity]]. Consequently, we do not have sufficient information about biodiversity in most places on earth. Even though biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles in [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, this is still a hypothesis to be tested in aquatic and especially [[marine ecosystem]]s where causes of this phenomenon are unclear. In addition, particularly in marine ecosystems, there are several well stated cases where diversity in higher latitudes actually increases.&lt;ref&gt;Moustakas et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the lack of information on biodiversity of Polar Regions prevents scientific conclusions on the distribution of the world's aquatic biodiversity.

'''Restoration''' is a process that attempts to return [[cultural heritage]] to some previous state that the restorer imagines was the "original". This was commonly done in the past. However, in the late 20th century a separate concept of [[conservation-restoration]] was developed that is more concerned with preserving the work of art for the future, and less with making it look pristine. Restoration is controversial, since it often involves some irreversible change to the original material of the artwork with the goal of making it "look good." The attitude that has developed in recent years with the development of conservation is to attempt to make all restoration reversible.
 
==Techniques==
[[File:Carroll Wales, Art Restorer, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration- Boston.jpg|thumbnail|Restoration of [[Kariye Camii]], Istanbul, 1957]]
Art conservation can involve the cleaning and stabilization of art work. Ideally, any process used is reversible, departures from that ideal not being undertaken lightly. Cleaning is not a reversible process and can sometimes be controversial due to fears that cleaning would damage a piece, or on the grounds that damage or residue forms part of the history of a given piece and should not be modified. [[Michelangelo]]'s [[David (Michelangelo)|statue of David]] has undergone two cleanings to remove dirt that had accumulated on the statue's surface.

Art restoration is vital to the survival of classical paintings and is part of the scientific application of chemistry.  It often involves research to determine the original colors and materials of a work.

===Watercolor on fresco===
The use of watercolor paints to inpaint damages on fresco is an example of a technique utilized to achieve almost complete reversibility. This is the technique used in the 20 year [[Conservation-restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper|restoration of Da Vinci's ''The Last Supper'']] in Milan. One of the most popular inpainting techniques used today is the Tinted Varnish Treatment. This process is done once the piece is fully cleaned and varnished. This last step in the restoration process is to then go into spots where original paint may be missing, or where patched holes and other irregularities may lie. The restorer then goes in with tinted varnish over the top of the non-tinted varnish. This gives the illusion that the spots have been "re-painted", while in fact it is just a spot of tinted varnish. Most commonly "stippling" is used while using tinted varnish, in order for light to reflect similar to paint. This is done by using tiny dots in a row for variance.

===Painting with light===

In 2014, Harvard Art Museums exhibited murals by [[Mark Rothko]] from 1961 and 1962 which had faded due to their original display in a dining room.  It restored the works to their original appearance by digitally projecting light carefully calibrated at each pixel from a photograph of the original colors, which made up the difference between the current and original appearance without damaging the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2014-06-03|accessdate=2015-06-07|url=http://www.gizmag.com/rothko-harvard-murals/32374/|title=Harvard uses projection technology to shine new light on faded Rothko murals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/about/press/mark-rothko%E2%80%99s-harvard-murals-feature-harvard-art-museums%E2%80%99-inaugural-special-exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3108">'''Romance studies''' is an academic discipline that covers the study of the languages, literatures, and cultures of areas that speak a [[Romance languages|Romance language]].  Romance studies departments usually include the study of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  Additional languages of study include [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], on one hand, and culture, history, and politics on the other hand.

Because most places in [[Latin America]] speak a Romance language, Latin America is also studied in Romance studies departments.  As a result, non-Romance languages in use in Latin America, such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], are sometimes also taught in Romance studies departments.

Romance studies departments differ from single- or two-language departments in that they attempt to break down the barriers in scholarship among the various languages, through interdisciplinary or comparative work.  These departments differ from Romance ''language'' departments in that they place a heavier emphasis on connections between language and literature, among others.

[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|right|A 12th-century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]
[[File:Sheela na gig, St. Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall.jpg|thumb|Sheela na gig on the south-west pillar of the presbytery in [[St Magnus Cathedral|St. Magnus Cathedral]], Kirkwall, Orkney, ca. twelfth-thirteenth centuries, [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]]]

'''Sheela na gigs''' are figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated [[vulva]]. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found all over [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; on [[church (building)|churches]], [[castles]], and other buildings. The highest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; McMahon and Roberts cite 101 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts – An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland.  There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, Éamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

[[File:Sheelanagigfethardwall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheela na gig on town wall in [[Fethard, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]]]]

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''Síle'' and ''Síla''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''Síle na gcíoch'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 – The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Seán-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gCíoch'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''Síle ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''Síle,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''Síle na gCíoċ'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Foclóir Gaeḋlge agus Béarla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ɡʲiː|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===
[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|text-top|thumb|right|La Fontaine plate, illustrated by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] (1762)]]
Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar González|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

The following countries are known to have (or have had) churches with female exhibitionist figures on them:&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

A significant number of the figures are found in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] contexts,&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; especially in France, northern Spain, Britain, and Norway. In Ireland figures commonly are found in areas of Norman influence.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

R. (July 2004) [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/22554 "Social Savings as a Measure of the Contribution of a New Technology to Economic Growth".] Working Paper 06/04, Department of Economic History, [[London School of Economics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in 1950 by [[United States|American]] economic historian and scientist [[Robert Fogel]], explains the [[methodology]] works to estimate the cost-savings of the new [[technology]] compared with the next best alternative.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; The first oral presentation was at the 1960 Purdue Cliometrics meeting, and the first published version was in the Journal of economic history in 1962.

A recent [[Survey data collection|survey]] can be found in "economic and history: surveys in Cliometrics", edited by David Greasley and Les Oxley and published by Wiley-Blackwell in 2011. The relevant chapter is entitled "social savings" and is by [[Tim Leunig]], [[London School of Economics]]. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00636.x/abstract]

==Calculation==
The amount of social savings (SS) may be calculated as
:SS = (P&lt;sub&gt;T0&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;)T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
where P&lt;sub&gt;T0&lt;/sub&gt; is the price per unit of the alternative technology, P&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; is the price of the technology being evaluated. T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the quantity processed by the technology being evaluated.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; This saving in resource costs may be taken to be equal to the gain in [[Gross National Income|real national income]].&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; Two noted social savings applications include social savings analysis on the contribution of the [[Rail transport in the United States|railway]] to the 19th century economic growth and the impact of [[information technology]] to the 20th century economic growth.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt;

== Railroads and American economic growth ==
Social savings was introduced and applied to the railroads in a seminal book by economic historian and scientist [[Robert Fogel]].&lt;ref name="Fogel64"&gt;Fogel R. (1964) ''Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History'', The Johns Hopkins University Press; 1st Edition. {{ISBN|0-8018-0201-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; The social savings analysis involved using quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 if there were no railroads.&lt;ref name="davis.shtml"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History | Book Reviews | EH.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of railroads, freight transportation by rivers and canals would have been only moderately more expensive along most common routes.  &lt;ref name="davis.shtml"/&gt; Fogel concluded that the difference in cost (or "social savings") attributable to railroads was negligible - about 2.7% of GNP. This [[counterfactual history]] view was vastly different from views proffered by railroad [[historians]] and made a controversial name for [[cliometrics]].

'''Social simulation''' is a research field that applies [[computer|computational]] methods to study issues in the [[social sciences]]. The issues explored include problems in [[computational law]], [[psychology]],&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H. P.

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* '''[[norm (social)|Social norms]]''': [[Robert Axelrod]] has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Axelrod (1986): [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/Axelrod%20Norms%20APSR%201986%20(2).pdf An Evolutionary Approach to Norms]&lt;/ref&gt; others have modeled the emergence of norms using [[meme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flentge, Daniel Polani and Thomas Uthmann (2001) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/4/3.html Modelling the Emergence of Possession Norms using Memes]&lt;/ref&gt; or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Staller and Paolo Petta (2001): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/2.html Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Neumann (2008): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/6.html Homo Socionicus: a Case Study of Simulation Models of Norms] for an overview of the recent (as of 2008) research.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Institutions]]''': by investigating under what conditions agents manage to coordinate,&lt;ref&gt;José Castro Caldas and Helder Coelho (1999): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/2/1.html The Origin of Institutions: socio-economic processes, choice, norms and conventions]&lt;/ref&gt; or by modeling the works of [[Robert Putnam]] on civic traditions&lt;ref&gt;Dan Miodownik, Britt Cartrite and Ravi Bhavnani (2010): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/13/3/1.html Between Replication and Docking: "Adaptive Agents, Political Institutions, and Civic Traditions" Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Reputation]]''', for example by making agents with a model of reputation from [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (image, social esteem, and prestige) and observing their behavior in a virtual marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Hahn, Bettina Fley, Michael Florian, Daniela Spresny and Klaus Fischer (2007) : [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/10/1/2.html Social Reputation: a Mechanism for Flexible Self-Regulation of Multiagent Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO’s contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

'''Sustainability standards and certifications''' are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas.  There are perhaps up to 500 such standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of [[Ecolabel]]s and standards for [[Organic food]] and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Overview article on sustainability standards in the food industry]&lt;/ref&gt; A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as "certification" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.

The basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold.  Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and [[NGO]] movements around the globe demanded action.  For example, campaigns by Global Exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030618203029/http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/sweatshops/nike/ |Global Exchange Campaign - Nike]&lt;/ref&gt; and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “[[sweatshop]]” factories by the likes of [[Nike, Inc.]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the [[SA8000]] and others.  Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the [[Business-to-business|B2B]] supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, organic and other standards.  A leading example of a consumer standard is the [[Fairtrade]] movement, administered by [[FLO International]] and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx Fairtrade Growth] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225094221/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/press_office/press_releases_and_statements/jun_2009/global_fairtrade_sales_increase_by_22.aspx |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a [[Business-to-business|B2B]] standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]’s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.

However, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and [[precompetitive]] industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} .

With the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering ''real'' social, environmental and economic results. The [[ISEAL Alliance]] has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.

Attempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of [[State of Sustainability Initiatives|The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI)]] project, facilitated by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) and the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

== Origin of global standards ==

''Most'' sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by [[social movements]] in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as [[UTZ Certified|Utz Certified]] (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including [[Kraft Foods]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] and [[Nestle]], assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development ([[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit|GIZ]]). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1668888 Article on the Development of the Common Code for the Coffee Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.

Evidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[ISEAL Alliance]] in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.

== Different sustainability standards ==
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}

Numerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1678472 Introduction to different standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Additional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.

=== Fairtrade ===

The [[Fairtrade]] label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The initiative performs [[development work]] and promotes its political vision of an [[alternative economy]], seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The ''most distinguishing'' feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a [[social premium]] that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.

=== Rainforest Alliance ===
{{Tone|date=May 2017}}
The [[Rainforest Alliance]] was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers’ welfare by establishing and securing ''sustainable'' livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed [[floor price]], the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields and enhanced cost efficiency{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Utz Certified ===

[[UTZ Certified]] (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster [[Ahold Coffee Company]] in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. ''Instruments'' include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has ''stringent'' chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).

=== Organic ===
The [[Organic farming|Organic]] standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on [[IFOAM]] Basic Standards{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== trustea ===

The [http://www.trustea.org trustea code] is designed to evaluate the social, economic, [[agronomic]] and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).

It is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly– producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.

=== SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===

SuRe® is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges-africa/news/sustainable-trade-infrastructure-in-africa-a-key-element-for-growth&lt;/ref&gt; GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe® standard at a [[COP21]] event on 9 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomycoalition.org/updates/gib-launches-sure%C2%AE-standard-cop21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
Other types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the [[Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil]] (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as [[GlobalGAP]];
Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as [[Starbucks#Coffee and Farmer Equity .28C.A.F.E..29 practices|Starbucks' CAFE Practices]]; and national programmes such as the [[Bord Bia|Irish Food Board]]'s 'Origin Green' scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Topics/Product-differentiation/Special-report-Implications-of-sustainability-certification-schemes-for-the-ACP ''Agritrade'': Implications of sustainability certification schemes for the ACP] 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards]] (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards|url=https://unfss.org|website=UNFSS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5|location=New York|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable development ties together concern for the [[carrying capacity]] of [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. [[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. [[William Flynn Martin]], David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman [[John Dingell]].{{Citation needed|reason=This is not common historical knowledge and should probably be documented with a secondary source as well.|date=August 2018}}

In 1980 the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.a21italy.it/medias/31C2D26FD81B0D40.pdf|title=World Conservation Strategy: Living Resource Conservation for Sustainable Development|date=1980|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the term "sustainable development".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Age of Sustainable Development|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780231173155|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4}} Two years later, the [[United Nations]] [[World Charter for Nature]] raised five principles of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=World Charter for Nature|date=28 October 1982|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations, General Assembly, 48th Plenary Meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] released the report ''Our Common Future'', commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Brundtland2"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1987|title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm|publisher=United Nations|author=[[Brundtland Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Development, 2nd edition|last=Smith|first=Charles|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-333-72228-0|location=Basingstoke|pages=|id=|authorlink=Charles Emrys Smith|author2=Rees, Gareth}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pull quote|Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:&lt;br /&gt;· The concept of 'needs', in particular, the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and &lt;br /&gt;· The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.|author=[[World Commission on Environment and Development]]|source=''[[Our Common Future]]'' (1987)}}

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/4362669/Reframing_Social_Sustainability_Reporting_Towards_an_Engaged_Approach|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|publisher=University of Melbourne|doi=10.1007/s10668-012-9384-2|author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A.

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth. Philadelphia: [[Westminster John Knox Press|Westminster Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in many fields have highlighted ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Meadows, D.H., D.L. Meadows, J.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996.

====Technology====
{{See also|Appropriate technology|Environmental engineering|Environmental technology}}
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

===Progress===
{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E.

Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===

The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20815">'''Technological innovations''' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age. New technologies are developed and co-exist with the old before supplanting them. Transport offers several examples; from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse-based transportation. '''Technological transitions''' (TT) describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the technological developments TT considers wider societal changes such as “user practices, regulation, industrial networks (supply, production, distribution), infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture”.&lt;ref name="Geels"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; For a technology to have use, it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Hughes&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T.P., 1987. The evolution of large technological systems. In: Bijker, W.E., Hughes, T.P., Pinch, T. (Eds.), The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology. Cambridge (MA): MIT Press. pp. 51-82&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the ‘seamless web’ where physical artefacts, organisations, scientific communities, and social practices combine. A technological system includes technical and non-technical aspects, and it a major shift in the socio-technical configurations (involving at least one new technology) is when a technological transition occurs.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, J., 1993. ‘Configurations: Crystallizing Contingency’, The International Journal of Human Factors in Manufacturing, 3, pp. 15-36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including [[history of science]], technology studies, and [[evolutionary economics]].&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; The focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change, but as a driver of this [[technological change]] has been considered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Geels_a"&gt;Geels, F.W., 2005. Technological transitions and system innovations. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph [[Schumpeter]], in his classic ''Theory of Economic Development''&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, T., 1934. The theory of economic development: an inquiry into profits, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycle. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; placed the emphasis on non-economic forces as the driver for growth. The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.

===Long wave theory===
The Russian economist Kondratiev&lt;ref&gt;Kondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined five cycles in the modern age:

* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770–1830)
* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830–1880)
* The Age of Steel (1880–1930)
* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930–1980)
* The Information Age (1980-?)

Freeman and Perez&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed ‘techno-economic paradigms’, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. 

Following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.

===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===
[[Thomas Kuhn]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]&lt;ref&gt;Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the concept of ’technical paradigms’ and ‘technological trajectories’.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)defined the concept of the ‘technological regime’ which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.

==Multi-level perspective on technological transitions==
In analysing (historic) cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi-level perspective (MLP) as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio-technical systems. (&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone
(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;Kemp, R., Schot, J. and Hoogma, R., 1998. Regime shifts to sustainability through processes of niche formation: The approach of strategic niche management. Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management. 10 (2), pp. 175-198&lt;/ref&gt;)  [[Innovation system]] approaches traditionally focus on the production side. A socio-technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production, with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F. W., 2004. From sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. Insights about dynamics and change from sociology and institutional theory. Research Policy 33 (6-7) pp. 897–920&lt;/ref&gt; Linking the two domains are the distribution, infrastructure and markets of the product. This approach considers a transition to be multi-dimensional as technology is only one aspect. 

The MLP proposes three analytical levels: the niche, regime and landscape. 

'''Niche''' (Micro-level)
Radical innovations occur at the niche level. These act as ‘safe havens’ for fledgling technologies to develop, largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp" /&gt; The US Military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft, radio and the internet. More recently, California’s Silicon Valley has provided an arena for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] focused technologies to emerge. Some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail. 

'''Regime''' (Meso-level)
The socio-technical regime, as defined by Geels,&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; includes a web of inter-linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules.  In effect, the established practices of a given system. Seven dimensions have been identified in the socio-technical regime: technology, user practices and application, the symbolic meaning of technology, infrastructure, policy and techno-scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; Change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level. The actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new. This is known as ‘lock-in’.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

'''Landscape''' (Macro-level)
Exogenous to the previous levels is the socio-technical landscape.&lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt; A broad range of factors are contained here, such as economic pressures, cultural values, social trends, wars and environmental issues. Change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level. 

A transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred. This is the result of the interplay between the three levels.  Regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt; As such, transitions are difficult to achieve. The current regime is typically suffering internal issues. Pressure from the landscape level may cause ‘cracks’ or ‘windows of opportunity’ through which innovations at the niche level may initially co-exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency. Once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed.&lt;ref name="Genus"&gt;Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case study===
The MLP has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio-technical regimes for mobility, sanitation, food, lighting and so on.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; While early research focused on historical transitions, a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport, energy and housing.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Geels &lt;ref name="Geels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation. The technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the UK will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation. 

Great Britain was the world’s leading naval power in the nineteenth century, and led the way in the transition from sail to steam.  At first, the introduction of steam technology co-existed with the current regime. Steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam / sail ships appeared. Landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology. A demand for trans-Atlantic emigration was prompted by the Irish potato famine, European political instability and the lure of gold in California. The requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship-development. From the late 1880s, as steamship technology improved and costs dropped, the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established. The changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices, new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities.

==Transition paths==
The nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot &lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt; defined five transition paths:

* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.
* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.
* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. 
* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).
* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.

==Characteristics of technological transitions==
Six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''
Technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;
 
''Multi-actors are involved''
Scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.

''Transitions occur at multiple levels''
As shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. 

''Transitions are a long-term process''
Complete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt;

''Transitions are radical''
For a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  

''Change is Non-linear''
The rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.

==Diffusion: transition phases==
Diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why. Everett (1962).The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.&lt;ref name="Rotmans"&gt;Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.&lt;ref name="Rotmans" /&gt; This process can be speeded-up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. 

Geels&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phases one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion, external factors – ‘windows of opportunity’ are required.

==Windows of opportunity==
A number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: 

* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.
* Problems external to the system. Such ‘problems’ are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.
* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.
* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation
* Complimentary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough

Alongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt; These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.&lt;ref name="Rip" /&gt; Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.

==Societal relevance==
The study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Geels_a" /&gt;  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. 

Developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.

==Criticisms==
Genus and Coles&lt;ref name="Genus" /&gt; outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.&lt;ref&gt;Shove E, Walker G, 2007, "CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."—from ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in nature…i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as “infocognitive potential”, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

'''Transdisciplinarity''' connotes a research strategy that crosses many [[Discipline (academia)|disciplinary]] boundaries to create a [[Holism|holistic]] approach. It applies to research efforts focused on problems that cross the boundaries of two or more disciplines, such as research on effective [[information system]]s for [[biomedical research]] (see [[bioinformatics]]), and can refer to concepts or methods that were originally developed by one discipline, but are now used by several others, such as [[ethnography]], a field research method originally developed in [[anthropology]] but now widely used by other disciplines.
The Belmont Forum &lt;ref&gt;http://www.belmontforum.org&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated that a transdisciplinary approach is enabling inputs and scoping across scientific and non-scientific stakeholder communities and facilitating a systemic way of addressing a challenge. This includes initiatives that support the capacity building required for the successful transdisciplinary formulation and implementation of research actions.

==Usage==
Transdisciplinarity has two common meanings:

===German usage===
In German-speaking countries, ''Transdisziplinarität'' refers to the integration of diverse forms of research, and includes specific methods for relating knowledge in problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstrass 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 conference held at the [[University of Göttingen]] showcased the diverse meanings of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinarity and made suggestions for converging them without eliminating present usages.&lt;ref&gt;Brand/Schaller/Völker 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When the very nature of a problem is under dispute, transdisciplinarity can help determine the most relevant problems and research questions involved.&lt;ref&gt;(Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; A first type of question concerns the cause of the present problems and their future development (system knowledge). Another concerns which values and norms can be used to form goals of the problem-solving process (target knowledge). A third relates to how a problematic situation can be transformed and improved (transformation knowledge). Transdisciplinarity requires adequate addressing of the complexity of problems and the diversity of perceptions of them, that abstract and case-specific knowledge are linked, and that practices promote the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch Hadorn et al. 2008, Jaeger &amp; Scheringer 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity arises when participating experts interact in an open discussion and dialogue, giving equal weight to each perspective and relating them to each other. This is difficult because of the overwhelming amount of information involved, and because of incommensurability of specialized languages in each field of expertise. To excel under these conditions, researchers need not only in-depth knowledge and know-how of the disciplines involved, but skills in moderation, mediation, association and transfer.

===Wider usage===
Transdisciplinarity is also used to signify a unity of knowledge beyond disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] introduced this usage of the term in 1970, and in 1987, the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CIRET) adopted the Charter of Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inters.org/Freitas-Morin-Nicolescu-Transdisciplinarity Charter of Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1st World Congress of Transdisciplinarity, Convento da Arrabida, Portugal, November 1994.

In the CIRET approach, transdisciplinarity is radically distinct from [[interdisciplinarity]]. Interdisciplinarity, like pluridisciplinarity, concerns the transfer of methods from one discipline to another, allowing research to spill over disciplinary boundaries, but staying within the framework of disciplinary research.

As the prefix "trans" indicates, transdisciplinarity concerns that which is at once between the disciplines, across the different disciplines, and beyond each individual discipline. Its goal is the understanding of the present world, of which one of the imperatives is the overarching unity of knowledge.

Another critical defining characteristic of transdisciplinary research is the inclusion of stakeholders in defining research objectives and strategies in order to better incorporate the diffusion of learning produced by the research. Collaboration between stakeholders is deemed essential&amp;nbsp;– not merely at an academic or disciplinary collaboration level, but through active collaboration with people affected by the research and community-based stakeholders. In such a way, transdisciplinary collaboration becomes uniquely capable of engaging with different ways of knowing the world, generating new knowledge, and helping stakeholders understand and incorporate the results or lessons learned by the research.&lt;ref&gt;Wickson, F., Carew, A.L. &amp; Russell, A.W. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity is defined by [[Basarab Nicolescu]] through three methodological postulates: the existence of levels of Reality, the logic of the included middle, and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinarity&amp;nbsp;– Theory and Practice (Ed.), Hampton Press, Cresskill, NJ, USA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality ; moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.

According to Nicolescu, transdisciplinarity is nevertheless radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity because of its goal, the understanding of the present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010). Theme-based research in the transdisciplinary field of educational linguistics. In F.M. Hult (Ed.), ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics'' (pp. 19-32). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, transdisciplinarity is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new applied researches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Big History]] represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. According to Collado,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bioethics as a transdisciplinary science of complexity: a coevolutive introduction from the Big History |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transdisciplinary methodology applied in the field of [[Big History]] seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos, and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. In abstract, the teaching of [[Big History]] in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] implies a transdisciplinary vision that integrates and unifies diverse epistemes that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, including ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach.

==Arts and humanities==
Transdisciplinarity can be found in the arts and humanities. For example, the [[Planetary Collegium]] seeks "the development of transdisciplinary discourse in the convergence of art, science, technology and consciousness research." The [http://www.plasticites-sciences-arts.org/plasticities-sciences-arts/ Plasticities Sciences Arts] (PSA) research group also develops transdisiciplinary approaches regarding humanities and fundamental sciences relationships as well as the Art &amp; Science field.

==Global education==
Transdisciplinarity can be also found in Global Education. For example, [[Global Education Magazine]], an international journal supported by [[UNESCO]] and [[UNHCR]]:
"transdisciplinarity represents the capable germ to promote an endogenous development of the evolutionary spirit of internal critical consciousness, where religion and science are complementary. Respect, solidarity and cooperation should be global standards for the entire human development with no boundaries. This requires a radical change in the ontological models of sustainable development, global education and world-society. We must rely on the recognition of a plurality of models, cultures and socio-economical diversification. As well as biodiversity is the way for the emergence of new species, cultural diversity represents the creative potential of world-society." &lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinary Education as Ethic of the Diversity Reform in the World-Society of the 21st Century, article published by Javier Collado on June 20th: World Refugee Day in Global Education Magazine, {{ISSN|2255-033X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human sciences==
The range of transdisciplinarity becomes clear when the four central questions of biological research ((1) ''[[Causality|causation]]'', (2) ''[[ontogeny]],'' (3) [[adaptation]], (4) [[phylogeny]] [after [[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963, see also [[Tinbergen's four questions]], cf. [[Aristotle]]: Causality / Four Major Causes]) are graphed against distinct levels of analysis (e.g. [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], ''[[individual]], [[Group (sociology)|group]]''; [cf. "Laws about the Levels of Complexity" of [[Nicolai Hartmann]] 1940/1964, see also [[Rupert Riedl]] 1984]):&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Medicus 2005, with the authors permission&lt;/ref&gt;

In this "scheme of transdisciplinarity", all anthropological disciplines (paragraph C in the table of the pdf-file below), their questions (paragraph A: see pdf-file) and results (paragraph B: see pdf-file) can be intertwined and allocated with each other for examples how these aspects go into those little boxes in the matrix, see e.g. the table {{cite web|title=The Framework of Anthropological Research|url=http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707071403/http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-07|df=}} This chart includes all realms of anthropological research (no one is excluded). It is the starting point for a systematical order for all human sciences, and also a source for a consistent networking and structuring of their results. This "bio-psycho-social" orientation framework is the basis for the development of the "Fundamental Theory of Human Sciences" and for a transdisciplinary consensus. (In this tabulated orientation matrix the questions and reference levels in ''italics'' are also the subject of the humanities.). Niko Tinbergen was familiar with both conceptual categories (i.e. the four central questions of biological research and the levels of analysis), the tabulation was made by [[Gerhard Medicus]]. Certainly, a humanist perspective always involves a transdisciplinary focus. A good and classic example of mixing very different sciences was the work developed by Leibniz in seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in order to create a universal system of justice.&lt;ref&gt;See José Andrés-Gallego, 42. "Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream": Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118-132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Typesetting''' is the composition of [[Written language|text]] by means of arranging physical [[Sort (typesetting)|types]]&lt;ref name="typesetting random house dictionary definition"&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 23 December 2009. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typeset Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called [[sort (typesetting)|sorts]] in mechanical systems and [[glyphs]] in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's [[orthography]] for visual display. Typesetting requires one or more [[font]]s (which are widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for [[typeface]]s). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A., ''The Library: An Illustrated History'', ALA edition, Skyhorse, 2009, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-digital era==

===Manual typesetting===
{{Main|Movable type}}
During much of the [[Letterpress printing|letterpress era]], movable type was composed by hand for each [[page (paper)|page]]. Cast metal ''[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]'' were composed into words, then lines, then paragraphs, then pages of text and tightly bound together to make up a ''form'', with all letter faces exactly the same "height to paper", creating an even surface of type. The form was placed in a press, inked, and an impression made on paper.

During typesetting, individual sorts are picked from a type case with the right hand, and set into a composing stick held in the left hand from left to right, and as viewed by the setter upside down. As seen in the photo of the composing stick, a lower case 'q' looks like a 'd', a lower case 'b' looks like a 'p', a lower case 'p' looks like a 'b' and a lower case 'd' looks like a 'q'. This is reputed to be the origin of the expression "mind your p's and q's". It might just as easily have been "mind your b's and d's".

The diagram at right illustrates a cast metal sort: '''a''' face, '''b''' body or shank, '''c''' point size, '''1''' shoulder, '''2''' nick, '''3''' groove, '''4''' foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. Not shown, and more the concern of the casterman, is the “set”, or width of each sort. Set width, like body size, is measured in points.

In order to extend the working life of type, and to account for the finite sorts in a case of type, copies of forms were cast when anticipating subsequent printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. This was particularly prevalent in book and newspaper work where rotary presses required type forms to wrap an impression cylinder rather than set in the bed of a press. In this process, called [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyping]], the entire form is pressed into a fine matrix such as [[plaster of Paris]] or [[papier mâché]] called a [[flong]] to create a positive, from which the stereotype form was electrotyped, cast of [[type metal]].

Advances such as the [[typewriter]] and [[computer]] would push the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and [[letterpress]] printing have not fallen completely out of use, and since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a revival as an [[artisanal]] pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market.

===Hot metal typesetting===
{{main|Hot metal typesetting}}
The time and effort required to manually compose the text led to several efforts in the 19th century to produce mechanical typesetting. While some, such as the [[Paige compositor]], met with limited success, by the end of the 19th century, several methods had been devised whereby an operator working a keyboard or other devices could produce the desired text. Most of the successful systems involved the in-house casting of the type to be used, hence are termed "hot metal" typesetting. The [[Linotype machine]], invented in 1884, used a keyboard to assemble the casting matrices, and cast an entire line of type at a time (hence its name). In the [[Monotype System]], a keyboard was used to [[Punched tape|punch a paper tape]], which was then fed to control a casting machine. The [[Ludlow Typograph]] involved hand-set matrices, but otherwise used hot metal. By the early 20th century, the various systems were nearly universal in large newspapers and publishing houses.

===Phototypesetting===
{{Main|Phototypesetting}}
[[Image:Linotype CRTronic 360.jpg|thumb|200px|Linotype CRTronic 360 phototypesetting terminal]]
[[Phototypesetting|Phototypesetting or "cold type"]] systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass or film disks or strips (one per font) that spun in front of a light source to selectively expose characters onto light-sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were connected to computer front ends.

One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a [[punched tape|punched paper tape]] corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device that mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative [[film]]. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a [[Galley proof|galley]].  The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or [[paste up]] of a whole page.  A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make [[Printing plate|plate]]s for [[offset printing]].

==Digital era==
[[File:Door toename automatisering in krantenbedrijf verdwijnt het oude zettersvak Weeknummer, 77-14 - Open Beelden - 13160.ogv|thumb|Dutch newsreel from 1977 about the transition to computer typesetting]]
The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a [[cathode ray tube]]. Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 (1963),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA351 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology], 1976&lt;/ref&gt; IBM 2680 (1967), [[Information International, Inc.|I.I.I.]] VideoComp (1973?), Autologic APS5 (1975),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G6a2tSuOoq8C&amp;pg=PA352 Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Linotron 202 (1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linotype.com/en/49-14026/19731989.html Linotype History]&lt;/ref&gt; These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Such machines could be "driven online" by a computer front-end system or took their data from magnetic tape. Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives.

&lt;/ref&gt; Character-by-character, computer-aided [[phototypesetting]] was, in turn, rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems employing a [[raster image processor]] to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] an entire page to a single high-resolution [[digital image]], now known as imagesetting.

The first commercially successful laser imagesetter, able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp. ECRM, [[Compugraphic]] (later purchased by [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]]) and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own.

Early [[minicomputer]]-based typesetting software introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[Datalogics]] Pager, Penta, [[Atex (software)|Atex]], Miles 33, Xyvision, troff from [[Bell Labs]], and IBM's [[IBM SCRIPT|Script]] product with CRT terminals, were better able to drive these electromechanical devices, and used text [[markup language]]s to describe [[typeface|type]] and other page formatting information. The descendants of these text markup languages include [[SGML]], [[XML]] and [[HTML]].

The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste-up and eventually produced entire pages and [[signature]]s of 4, 8, 16 or more pages using [[imposition]] software on devices such as the Israeli-made [[Scitex]] Dolev. The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters, often proprietary or specific to a manufacturer or device, drove development of generalized printer control languages, such as [[Adobe Systems]]' [[PostScript]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s [[Printer Command Language|PCL]].

[[Image:Oscar wilde english renaissance of art 2.png|thumb|right|200px|Text sample (an extract of the essay ''The Renaissance of English Art'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]) typeset in [[Iowan Old Style]] roman, italics and small caps, adjusted to approximately 10 [[Line length|words per line]], with the typeface sized at 14 [[point (typography)|points]] on 1.4 x [[leading]], with 0.2 points extra [[tracking (typography)|tracking]].]]

Computerized typesetting was so rare that ''[[BYTE]]'' (comparing itself to "the proverbial shoemaker's children who went barefoot") did not use any computers in production until its August 1979 issue used a Compugraphics system for typesetting and page layout. The magazine did not yet accept articles on floppy disks, but hoped to do so "as matters progress".&lt;ref name="helmers197908"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Helmers |first=Carl |date=August 1979 |title=Notes on the Appearance of BYTE... |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1979-08/1979_08_BYTE_04-08_LISP#page/n157/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1980s, practically all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was performed by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest, where labor was cheap and paper was produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers.

In 1985, [[desktop publishing]] became available, starting with the [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] (and later [[QuarkXPress]]) and [[PostScript]]. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] and [[WordPerfect]], revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules (''H and J'').

By the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to outsource to freelancers and graphic design specialists.

The availability of cheap or free [[font]]s made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier, but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of [[PostScript]], supplemented by the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computers and operating systems.

===SCRIPT variants===
{{Main|SCRIPT (markup)}}
[[Image:John A Prior Health Sciences Library Mural Typesetter.jpg|thumb|Mural mosaic "Typesetter" at John A. Prior Health Sciences Library in Ohio]]
IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word "SCRIPT". Later versions of SCRIPT included advanced features, such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, [[Column (typography)|multicolumn]] page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.utk.edu/~mnewman/ibmguide07.html U01-0547, "Introduction to SCRIPT,"] is available through PRTDOC.&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP-67/CMS SCRIPT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html SCRIPT 90.1 Implementation Guide], June 6, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterloo Script was created at the University of Waterloo later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html CSG.uwaterloo.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AA/CS at UW took over project development in 1974. The program was first used at UW in 1975. In the 1970s, SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer. By the late 1980s, the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/1974.shtml A Chronology of Computing at The University of Waterloo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May 1975 issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter, which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT:

a) It easily handles footnotes.

b) Page numbers can be in Arabic or Roman numerals, and can appear at the top or bottom of the page, in the centre, on the left or on the right, or on the left for even-numbered pages and on the right for odd-numbered pages.

c) Underscoring or overstriking can be made a function of SCRIPT, thus uncomplicating editor functions.

d) SCRIPT files are regular OS datasets or CMS files.

e) Output can be obtained on the printer, or at the terminal…" 
The article also pointed out SCRIPT had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents, though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs.  Thus, SCRIPT had many of the capabilities computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/ChronologyGlossary.pdf Glossary of University of Waterloo Computing Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SCRIPT/VS]] was a SCRIPT variant developed at IBM in the 1980s.

DWScript is a version of SCRIPT for MS-DOS, called after its author, D. D. Williams,&lt;ref&gt;DWScript – Document Composition Facility for the IBM Personal Computer Version 4.6 Updates, DW-04167, Nov 8th, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but was never released to the public and only used internally by IBM.

Script is still available from IBM as part of the [[Document Composition Facility]] for the [[z/OS]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/printsoftware/dcfhome_z_ww.html IBM Document Composition Facility (DCF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SGML and XML systems===
The standard generalized markup language ([[SGML]]) was based upon IBM [[Generalized Markup Language]] (GML). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM Script. [[Document Style Semantics and Specification Language|DSSSL]] is an international standard developed to provide a stylesheets for SGML documents.

[[XML]] is a successor of SGML. [[XSL Formatting Objects|XSL-FO]] is most often used to generate PDF files from XML files.

The arrival of [[SGML]]/[[XML]] as the document model made other typesetting engines popular.

Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's [[XML Professional Publisher (XPP)]], [[FrameMaker]], [[Arbortext]]. XSL-FO compatible engines include [[Apache FOP]], [[Antenna House Formatter]], [[RenderX]]'s [[XEP (software)|XEP]].
These products allow users to program their SGML/XML typesetting process with the help of scripting languages.

YesLogic's [[Prince XML|Prince]] is another one, which is based on CSS Paged Media.

===Troff and successors===
{{Main|Troff}}
During the mid-1970s, [[Joseph Ossanna]], working at [[Bell Laboratories]], wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T [[phototypesetter]] owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by [[Brian Kernighan]] to support output to different equipment, such as [[laser printer]]s. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a [[GNU]] work-alike called [[groff (software)|groff]], are now [[open source]].

===TeX and LaTeX===
[[Image:AMS Euler sample.png|right|200px|thumb|Mathematical text typeset using TeX and the AMS [[Euler font]].]]
{{Main|TeX}}
The [[TeX]] system, developed by [[Donald E. Knuth]] at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system that has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics. [[LuaTeX]] and LuaLaTeX are variants of [[TeX]] and of [[LaTeX]] scriptable in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].  TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own, and deals more with appearance than structure. The [[LaTeX]] macro package written by [[Leslie Lamport]] at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface, and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document. LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books. Although standard TeX does not provide an interface of any sort, there are programs that do. These programs include [[Scientific Workplace]], [[Texmacs|TeXmacs]], [[MiKTeX]] and [[LyX]], which are graphical/interactive editors.

==Other text formatters==
Several other text formatting software exist, but are not widely used. Notably  [[Lout (software)|Lout]], [http://patoline.org/ Patoline], [http://sile-typesetter.org Sile], [https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/ Pollen], [http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/systems/ant/ Ant]

'''Universal design''' is the [[design]] of buildings, products or environments to make them [[accessibility|accessible]] to all people, regardless of age, [[disability]] or other factors.

The term "universal design" was coined by the [[architect]] [[Ronald Mace]] to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_us/usronmace.htm |title=Ronald L. Mace on NC State University, College of Design |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of ''Designing for the Disabled'' (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the [[curb cut|dropped curb]] – now a standard feature of the built environment.

Universal design emerged from slightly earlier '''barrier-free''' concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and [[adaptive technology|adaptive]] and [[assistive technology]] and also seeks to blend [[aesthetics]] into these core considerations. As [[life expectancy]] rises and [[modern medicine]] increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments.

Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  [[Contrast (vision)|Color-contrast]] dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another.  There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's [[public transit]] systems, low-floor [[bus]]es that "kneel" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with [[Wheelchair ramp|ramp]]s rather than on-board lifts.

==Principles==
The Center for Universal Design at [[North Carolina State University]] expounds the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/ |title=Center for Universal Design at North Carolina State University |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# [[Social equality|Equitable]] use
# [[Flexibility (engineering)|Flexibility]] in use
# [[Simplicity|Simple]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]]
# [[Perception|Perceptible]] information
# [[fault tolerance|Tolerance for error]]
# Low physical effort
# Size and space for approach and use

Each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm |title=The Principles of Universal Design Version 2.0 |publisher=Design.ncsu.edu |date=1997-04-01 |accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be applied to design processes in any realm: physical or digital.

These principles are broader than those of [[accessible design]] and barrier-free design.

==Goals of Universal Design==
In 2012, The Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access at [[The University at Buffalo]] expanded definition of the principles of universal design to include social participation and health and wellness. Rooted in evidence based design, the 8 goals of universal design were also developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universaldesign.com/what-is-ud/ |title=The Goals of Universal Design |publisher=Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access |date=April 10, 2012 |access-date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

# Body Fit
# Comfort
# Awareness
# Understanding
# Wellness
# Social Integration
# Personalization
# Cultural Appropriateness

The first four goals are oriented to human performance: [[anthropometry]], [[biomechanics]], [[perception]], [[cognition]]. Wellness bridges human performance and social participation. The last three goals addresses social participation outcomes. The definition and the goals are expanded upon in the textbook "Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1=Steinfeld | editor-first1=Edward | editor-last2=Maisel | editor-first2=Jordana | title=Universal Design: Creating Inclusive Environments | publisher=Wiley | date=April 10, 2012 | pages=408 pages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Smooth, ground level entrances without stairs
* Surface textures that require low force to traverse on level, less than 5 pounds force per 120 pounds rolling force
* Surfaces that are stable, firm, and slip resistant per ASTM 2047
* Wide interior doors (3'0"), hallways, and alcoves with 60" × 60" turning space at doors and dead-ends
* Functional clearances for approach and use of elements and components
* Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs
* Single-hand operation with closed fist for operable components including fire alarm pull stations
* Components that do not require tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist
* Components that require less than 5 pounds of force to operate
* Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches
* Buttons and other controls that can be distinguished by touch
* Bright and appropriate lighting, particularly task lighting
* Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays
* Visual output redundant with information in auditory output
* Contrast controls on visual output
* Use of meaningful icons with text labels
* Clear lines of sight to reduce dependence on sound
* Volume controls on auditory output
* Speed controls on auditory output
* Choice of language on speech output
* Ramp access in swimming pools
* Closed [[captioning]] on television networks
* Signs with light-on-dark visual contrast
* Web pages that provide alternative text to describe images
* Instruction that presents material both orally and visually
* Labels in large print on equipment control buttons
* A museum that allows visitors to choose to listen to or read descriptions

==Design standards==
In 1960, specifications for barrier free design were published. It was a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research. In 1961, the specifications became the first Barrier Free Design standard called the American National Standard, A1171.1 was published. It was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals. The research started in 1949 at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] and continues to this day. The principal investigator is Dr. [[Timothy Nugent]] (his name is listed in the front of the 1961, 1971, 1980 standard). In 1949 Dr. [[Timothy Nugent|Nugent]] also started the [[National Wheelchair Basketball Association]]. This [[ANSI]] A117.1 standard was adopted by the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] [[General Services Administration]] under 35 FR 4814 - 3/20/70, 39 FR 23214 - 6/27/74, 43 FR 16478 ABA- 4/19/78, 44 FR 39393 7/6/79, 46 FR 39436 8/3/81, in 1984 for UFAS and then in 1990 for ADA. The archived research documents are at the [[International Code Council]] (ICC) - ANSI A117.1 division. Dr. [[Timothy Nugent|Nugent]] made presentations around the globe in the late 50's and 60's presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design.

Another comprehensive publication by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] published three editions 1963, 1967, 1976 and 1997 of Designing for the Disabled by [[Selwyn Goldsmith]] UK. These publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities. Both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder.

Disability ergonomics should be taught to designers, engineers, non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities.

In October 2003, representatives from [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] met in [[Beijing, China|Beijing]] and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as it prepared to host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

The [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization]], and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] have developed:

==Design for All (DfA)==
The term '''Design for All''' (DfA) is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products, services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation. "Design for All is design for human diversity, social inclusion and equality" (EIDD Stockholm Declaration, 2004). According to the [[European Commission]], it "encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone: technologies that are suitable for the [[elderly]] and people with [[disabilities]], as much as the teenage techno wizard."&lt;ref name="European Commission"/&gt; The origin of Design for All&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibletourism.org/resources/uk_museumsand-galleries_disability_directory_pdf_6877.pdf |title=The UK Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  lies in the field of barrier free [[accessibility]] for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design.

===Background===
''Design for All'' has been highlighted in Europe by the European Commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in Europe.&lt;ref name="European Commission"&gt;European Commission: [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/policy/accessibility/dfa/index_en.htm Design for All (DfA)].&lt;/ref&gt; Design for All is about ensuring that environments, products, services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances.

Design for All has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition. It follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market. Easy-to-use, accessible, affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens. Design for All permits access to the built environment, access to services and user-friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons. Including Design for All early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market. This is best achieved by identifying and involving users ("stakeholders") in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of Design (for All) in a wide range of socio-economic situations.

===Examples===
The following examples of Designs for All were presented in the book ''Diseños para todos/Designs for All'' published in 2008 by Optimastudio with the support of Spain's Ministry of Education, Social Affairs and Sports (IMSERSO) and CEAPAT:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optimastudio.com/disenosparatodos Feo, Roberto &amp; Hurtado, Rosario &amp; Optimastudio ''Diseños para Todos/Designs for All'' Madrid 2008] {{ISBN|978-84-691-3870-0}} Downloadable free version of ''Designs for All''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In information and communication technology (ICT)===
{{Main article|Design for All (in ICT)}}

Design for All criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the [[Information society]]. The European Union refers to this under the terms eInclusion and eAccessibility. A three-way approach is proposed: goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or, failing that, products being easy to adapt according to different needs, or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology. To this end, manufacturers and service providers, especially, but not exclusively, in the [[Information and Communication Technologies]] (ICT), produce new technologies, products, services and applications for everyone.&lt;ref name="European Commission" /&gt;

===European DfA organizational networks===
In Europe, people have joined in [[Social network|networks]] to promote and develop Design for All:

*The European Design for All eAccessibility Network (EDeAN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edean.org/ European Design for All eAccessibility Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211231505/http://www.edean.org/ |date=December 11, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched under the lead of the European Commission and the European Member States in 2002. It fosters Design for All for eInclusion, that is, creating an information society for all. It has national contact centres (NCCs) in almost all EU countries and more than 160 network members in national networks.
*EIDD - Design for All Europe is a [[NGO]] and a 100% self-financed European organization that covers the entire area of theory and practice of Design for All, from the built environment and tangible products to communication, service and system design. Originally set up in 1993 as the European Institute for Design and Disability (EIDD), to enhance the quality of life through Design for All, it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business. EIDD - Design for All Europe disseminates the application of Design for All to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently (2016) has 31 member organizations in 20 European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfaeurope.eu|title=Design for All Europe|author=|date=|website=EIDD - DfA Europe|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EuCAN - The European Concept for Accessibility Network started in 1984 as an open network of experts and advocates from all over Europe in order to promote and support the Design for All approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eca.lu|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.eca.lu|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination work of EuCAN and the functioning of the network are mainly voluntary work. In 1999 the Luxembourg Disability Information and Meeting Centre (better known by its acronym “Info-Handicap”) took over the coordination of the steering group, together with the implicit responsibility for the follow-up of the [[European Concept for Accessibility]] (ECA). The EuCAN publications - like ECA - aim to provide practical guidance. They are neither academic nor policy documents.

==The "Barrier-Free" concept==
'''{{Nihongo|Barrier-free|バリアフリー|bariafurii}}''' building modification consists of modifying [[building]]s or facilities so that they can be used by people who are [[disabled]] or have physical impairments. The term is used primarily in Japan and non-English speaking countries (e.g. German: Barrierefreiheit; Finnish: Esteettömyys), while in English-speaking countries, terms such as "accessibility" and "handicapped accessible" dominate in regular everyday use. An example of barrier-free design would be installing a [[Wheelchair ramp|ramp]] for [[wheelchair]]s alongside or in place of steps. In the case of new buildings, however, the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design, which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access.

Freeing a building of barriers means:
* Recognizing the features that could form barriers for some people
* Thinking inclusively about the whole range of impairments
* Reviewing everything - from structure to smallest detail
* Seeking feedback from users and learning from mistakes

Barrier free is also a term that applies to handicap accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] Guidelines don't make specifications.

An example of a country that has sought to implement barrier-free accessibility in housing estates is Singapore. Within five years, all public housing estates in the country, all of 7,800 blocks of apartments, have benefited from the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mndsingapore.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/making-hdb-towns-user-friendly/|title=Making HDB Towns User Friendly|author=|date=19 November 2012|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vienna School of Art History''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte}}) was the development of fundamental [[art history|art-historical]] methods at the [[University of Vienna]]. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.

A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a "scientific" ("wissenschaftlich") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School  combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.

The concept of a Viennese "school" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by [[Otto Benesch]] in 1920 and by [[Julius von Schlosser]] in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.

== History ==

===Pragmatic art history===

[[Rudolf Eitelberger]] is considered to have been the "forefather" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the [[Vormärz]], and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.

The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was [[Moritz Thausing]], who in 1879 became the second ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from [[aesthetics]].

===Formalist art history===

Thausing's students [[Franz Wickhoff]] (Professor 1891) and [[Alois Riegl]] (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of [[late antiquity]], which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of [[positivism]], focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.

===Idealist art history===

After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by [[Max Dvořák]], who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of [[Mannerism]]. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed "''Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte''" ("art history as intellectual history"), found its most committed champions in [[Hans Tietze]] and [[Otto Benesch]].

===Structuralist art history===

Dvořák also died young, and in 1922 [[Julius von Schlosser]] was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] and of [[Karl Vossler]], a Munich-based professor of the [[Romance languages]], under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the "''Stilgeschichte''" ("style-history") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the "''Sprachgeschichte''" ("language-history") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides [[Ernst Gombrich]], were [[Hans Sedlmayr]] and [[Otto Pächt]], who in the 1930s founded art-historical "structuralism." Their methodology was described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as the "New Vienna School"; it has also been described as the "Second Vienna School."

===Ideological art history===

[[Josef Strzygowski]], who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original "Nordic" character, which was superior to the "Mediterranean." As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the "orthodox" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the "arch-humanist" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the "Attila of art history." The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of "''Planforschung''," which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely "Nordic," was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.

===Synthesis===

The era of [[Nazism]] signified a turning point for the Vienna School.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Aurenhammer, "Zäsur oder Kontinuität? Das Wiener Kunsthistorische Institut im Ständestaat und im Nationalsozialismus." In ''Wiener Schule. Erinnerung und Perspektiven'' (''Wiener Jahrbuch für Kunstgeschichte'', 53). Vienna, Cologne and Weimar 2004, pp. 11-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. [[Hans Sedlmayr]], a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, [[Karl Maria Swoboda]] assumed leadership of the ''Insitut'', where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two ''Ordinarius'' positions were once more created, and were filled by [[Otto Pächt]] (a student of Schlosser) and [[Otto Demus]] (a student of Strzygowski). Under the "two Ottos" Vienna became a "''Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte''" ("a mecca for medieval art history"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of [[Fritz Novotny]]. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

{{For|the railroad device|water crane}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|Deep sea water column]]

A '''water column''' is a conceptual column of water from the surface of a sea, river or lake to the bottom sediment.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, B.H., Axler, R., Hagley C., Host G., Merrick G., Richards C. (2004). "[http://waterontheweb.org/resources/glossary.html#W Glossary]". ''Water on the Web''. University of Minnesota-Duluth. Retrieved 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptively, the deep sea water column is divided into five parts—''[[pelagic zone]]s'' (from Greek πέλαγος (pélagos), 'open sea')—from the surface to below the floor, as follows: ''[[epipelagic]]'', from the surface to 200 meters below the surface; ''[[mesopelagic]]'', from 200 to 1000 meters below the surface; ''[[bathypelagic]]'', from 1000 to 4000 meters below the surface; ''[[abyssopelagic]]'', from 4000 meters below the surface to the level sea floor; ''[[hadopelagic]]'', depressions and crevices below the level sea floor.

The concept of water column is useful since many aquatic phenomena are explained by the incomplete vertical mixing of chemical, physical or biological parameters.  For example, when studying the metabolism of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]], it is the specific bottom layer concentration of available [[chemical]]s in the water column that is meaningful, rather than the average value of those chemicals throughout the water column. 

Water columns are used chiefly for [[environmental science|environmental studies]] evaluating the [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] or mixing of the thermal or chemically stratified layers in a lake, stream or ocean: for example, by wind-induced currents. Some of the common parameters analyzed in the water column are [[pH]], [[turbidity]], [[temperature]], [[hydrostatic pressure]], [[salinity]], [[total dissolved solids]], various [[pesticide]]s, [[pathogen]]s and a wide variety of chemicals and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

The term ''water column'' is also commonly used in [[scuba diving]] to describe the vertical space through which divers ascend and descend.

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the five—and in some cases six—largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=— Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=— Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8–9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12–13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}
