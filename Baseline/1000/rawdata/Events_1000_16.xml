      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4120">The '''AIDSRides''' were a series of fundraising events organised by Pallotta TeamWorks which raised more than $105 million for critical AIDS services and medical research.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} About half of the money raised directly benefited AIDS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2001-12-13/news/17632518_1_aids-patients-pat-christen-executive-director-aids-and-hiv | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=AIDS Ride planners sue S.F. charity over new race | date=2001-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] and the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] ended their partnership with the California AIDSRide over concerns that not enough money was going to the charities. They hired Honeycutt Group, a consulting firm started by three former Pallotta TeamWorks employees, to organize [[AIDS/LifeCycle]], a similar event. [[Dan Pallotta]] unsuccessfully sued the "copycat" event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/03/01/319484/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Dan Pallotta's bike-tour and walkathon business has raised more than $200 million for AIDS research &amp; other charities.

[[File:Victims of Abu Sleem massacre.JPG|thumb|People at a Benghazi rally looking at the photos of victims of Abu Salim prison massacre (February 2011)]]
'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human rights abuses==
[[Amnesty International]] has called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996,&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |title=Investigation needed into prison deaths |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317043628/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |archivedate=2015-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident which some have referred to as the '''Abu Salim prison massacre'''.&lt;ref name="court celebrates massacre"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|title=Libyan legal court celebrates Abu Salim prison massacre|publisher=[[Arabic News]]|date=24 June 2005|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227211022/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|archive-date=2011-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a "site of egregious [[human rights violations]]."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=  Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=  [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

==Libyan civil war==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=RAW,Libya, Rebels and citizens setting prisoners free from Abu Salim Priso in Tripoli 24.08.2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHy2jmVocQ |work=[[YouTube]] |author=FreePressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter [[Matthew VanDyke]] from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in [[Brega]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=American fighting Kadhafi 'lunatics' dreams of free Libya |first=Jay|last=Deshmukh |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 October 2011 |work=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggq9gizU50QT6TMAe6WPD-7Xytrw?docId=CNG.63f3ecd569de01fd9d60c41e9a017daa.931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/25/libya.freed.american/|title = American held in solitary escapes Tripoli prison|author = Phil Gast|work = CNN|date =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a "writer and journalist," but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN" /&gt;

'''Accidental incest''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[marriage]] between persons who were unaware of a family relationship between them which would be considered [[incest]]uous.

The laws of many jurisdictions [[Void marriage|void incestuous marriages]], even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, [[DNA testing]] may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records.

==Causes==
People may be unaware of a [[kinship]] relationship between them in a number of circumstances. For example, [[artificial insemination]] with an anonymous [[sperm donation|donated sperm]] may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iJlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RYgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2368,2279497&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Accidental Incest Risk Increases |date=15 March 1979 |work=Edmonton Journal |agency=Associated Press |page=61 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=coNSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6125,3788930&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Report From A Test Tube Baby |last=Atallah |first=Lillian |date=19 April 1976 |work=Ocala Star-Banner |page=35 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/30/international/europe/30sperm.html |title=Spreading Scandinavian Genes, Without Viking Boats |last=Alvarez |first=Lizette |date=30 September 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others limit sperm donations based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings.

==Notable cases==
*In 2008, it was reported that a British brother and sister, who were twins separated at birth, married without knowing of their relationship. According to the report, the relationship was discovered soon after their wedding, and the marriage was annulled. The case has raised the issue regarding whether adoptions should be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/01/11/twins.married/?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail |title=Unknowing twins married, lawmaker says |publisher=CNN |accessdate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturekitchen.com/mole333/blog/accidental_incest_twins_separated_at_birth_marr |title=Accidental Incest: Twins Separated at Birth Marry |last=Sabater |first=Liza |publisher=Culture Kitchen |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised, however, about whether the story is, in fact, true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 April 2012 |location=London |date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An engaged couple in South Africa, who had been together for five years and were expecting a child, discovered that they were brother and sister just before their wedding. They were raised separately and met as adults in college. Just before the wedding, their parents met and they came to realize that they were siblings. The couple broke off the relationship after the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stewart |last=Maclean |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057081/Engaged-couple-discover-brother-sister-parents-meet-days-wedding.html |title=Engaged couple discover they are brother and sister when their parents meet just before wedding |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' typically occurs from [[inhalation|breathing]] in [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) at excessive levels.&lt;ref name=Sc2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schottke|first1=David|title=Emergency Medical Responder: Your First Response in Emergency Care|date=2016|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1284107272|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are often described as "[[flu]]-like" and commonly include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, vomiting, [[chest pain]], and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Large exposures can result in [[loss of consciousness]], [[arrhythmias]], [[seizures]], or death.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; The classically described "cherry red skin" rarely occurs.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Long term complications may include feeling tired, trouble with memory, and movement problems.&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; In those [[smoke inhalation|exposed to smoke]], [[cyanide toxicity]] should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Gu2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=JA|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=537–48|pmid=22998990|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally or as an [[suicide|attempt to end one's life]].&lt;ref name=Buck2011/&gt; CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating.&lt;ref name=Bl2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleecker|first1=ML|title=Carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2015|volume=131|pages=191–203|pmid=26563790|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62627-1.00024-X|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=978-0444626271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced during [[incomplete combustion|incomplete burning]] of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This can occur from [[motor vehicles]], heaters, or cooking equipment that run on [[carbon-based fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; It can also occur from exposure to [[methylene chloride]].&lt;ref name=Fer2017/&gt; Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) preventing the [[blood]] from carrying [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome oxidase]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent poisoning include [[carbon monoxide detector]]s, proper venting of [[gas appliances]], keeping chimneys clean, and keeping [[exhaust system]]s of vehicles in good repair.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=National Center for Environmental|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning – Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en-us|date=30 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705012403/https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm|archivedate=5 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving [[oxygen therapy|100% oxygen]] along with [[supportive care]].&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This should generally be carried out until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; While [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buck2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=NA|last2=Juurlink|first2=DN|last3=Isbister|first3=G|last4=Bennett|first4=MH|last5=Lavonas|first5=EJ|title=Hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 April 2011|issue=4|pages=CD002041|pmid=21491385|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002041.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living – people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy (see below). However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| page=1154|date=October 1998|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J |title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=February 2002|pages=213–14|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]] and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|page=233|date=October 2003|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt;

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|thumb|Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]], which is located in all cells and breaks down [[heme]]. Under normal conditions, carbon monoxide levels in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are approximately 0 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.&lt;ref name="Kaplan.Physio"&gt;{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|author2=Kudrath, W. |author3=Passo, SS |author4=Wilson, LB|pages=167–68|chapter=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708–11|date=October 2002|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430–62|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152937/http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|date=May 2003|pages=25–38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt;

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis. Cells respond by switching to [[anaerobic metabolism]], causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], [[lactic acidosis]], and eventual cell death.&lt;ref name="PharmacolToxicol2003-alonso"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso JR, Cardellach F, Lopez S, Casademont J, Miro O |title=Carbon monoxide specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase of human mitochondrial respiratory chain|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|date=September 2003|pages=142–46|volume=93|issue=3|pmid=12969439|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0773.2003.930306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of [[oxidative metabolism]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt;

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|pages=270–72|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt; This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders.

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt; Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.&lt;ref name="Greingor"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M |title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy. One case report and review of the literature|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|volume=18|issue=5|pages=399–401|date=September 2001|pmid=11559621|pmc=1725677|doi=10.1136/emj.18.5.399|url=http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11559621}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farrow JR, Davis GJ, Roy TM, McCloud LC, Nichols GR |title=Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=35|issue=6|pages=1448–52|date=November 1990|pmid=2262778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin.]]
As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Varon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bennetto L, Powter L, Scolding NJ |title=Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning presenting without a history of exposure: A case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=2|issue=1|page=118|date=April 2008|pmid=18430228|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-118|pmc=2390579}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] compared to the amount of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.&lt;ref name="Clinical Toxicology2001-ford"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T |title=Clinical Toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0721654851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.&lt;ref&gt;Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 237–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keleş A, Demircan A, Kurtoğlu G |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154–57|date=June 2008|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring===
Carbon monoxide may be quantitated in blood using [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometric]] methods or [[chromatography|chromatographic techniques]] in order to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.

A [[CO-oximeter]] can be used to determine carboxyhemoglobin levels.&lt;ref name="pmid455674"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rodkey FL, Hill TA, Pitts LL, Robertson RF |title=Spectrophotometric measurement of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in blood|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=25|issue=8|pages=1388–93|date=August 1979|pmid=455674|doi=|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=455674|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7361284"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rees PJ, Chilvers C, Clark TJ |title=Evaluation of methods used to estimate inhaled dose of carbon monoxide|journal=Thorax|volume=35|issue=1|pages=47–51|date=January 1980|pmid=7361284|pmc=471219|doi= 10.1136/thx.35.1.47|url=http://thorax.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7361284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulse [[CO-oximeter]]s estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a [[pulse oximeter]].&lt;ref name="pmid18500075"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Coulange M, Barthelemy A, Hug F, Thierry AL, De Haro L|title=Reliability of new pulse CO-oximeter in victims of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Undersea &amp; Hyperbaric Medicine|volume=35|issue=2|pages=107–11|date=March 2008|pmid=18500075|doi=|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8084|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625021038/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/8084|archivedate=2011-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries.&lt;ref name="MaiselEditorial"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Maisel | first = William | authorlink =  |author2=Roger J.

As this is not possible in people who are unresponsive, these devices may not appropriate for use in on-scene emergency care detection of CO poisoning.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

There are many conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref name="Kao"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kao LW, Nañagas KA |title=Toxicity associated with carbon monoxide |journal=Clinics in Laboratory Medicine |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=99–125 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16567227 |doi=10.1016/j.cll.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emedicine"&gt;{{cite web | last =Shochat | first =Guy N | title =Toxicity, Carbon Monoxide | publisher =[[emedicine]] | date =17 February 2009 | url =http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819987-overview | accessdate =2009-04-27 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090309072832/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/819987-overview | archivedate =9 March 2009 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest symptoms, especially from low level exposures, are often non-specific and readily confused with other illnesses, typically [[influenza|flu-like viral syndromes]], [[clinical depression|depression]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[chest pain]], and [[migraine]] or other headaches.&lt;ref name="Chest1990-ilano"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ilano AL, Raffin TA | title=Management of carbon monoxide poisoning | journal=Chest | date=Jan 1990 | pages=165–69 | volume=97 | issue=1 | pmid=2403894 | doi=10.1378/chest.97.1.165  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide has been called a "great mimicker" due to the presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific.&lt;ref name="Kao"/&gt; Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis include [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[altitude sickness]], [[lactic acidosis]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[meningitis]], [[methemoglobinemia]], or [[Opioid overdose|opioid]] or toxic alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref name="emedicine"/&gt;

Prevention remains a vital [[public health]] issue, requiring public education on the safe operation of appliances, heaters, fireplaces, and internal-combustion engines, as well as increased emphasis on the installation of [[carbon monoxide detector]]s.&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ernst A, Zibrak JD |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=339|issue=22|pages=1603–08|date=November 1998|pmid=9828249|doi=10.1056/NEJM199811263392206|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=9828249&amp;promo=ONFLNS19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide is tasteless and odourless, and therefore can not be detected by visual cues or smell.&lt;ref name=Millar20008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air – the potential for evil from within |vauthors=Millar IL, Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=145–51 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063245/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= |pmid=22692708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has stated, "carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are," and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building.&lt;ref name="cpsc.gov"/&gt; These devices, which are relatively inexpensive&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"/&gt; and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Edward R|title=Keeping Watch on Carbon Monoxide|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100533/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building.&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krenzelok EP, Roth R, Full R |title=Carbon monoxide ... the silent killer with an audible solution |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=September 1996 |pages=484–86 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pmid=8765117 |doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90159-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yoon SS, Macdonald SC, Parrish RG |title=Deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and potential for prevention with carbon monoxide detectors |journal=JAMA |date=March 1998 |pages=685–87 |volume=279 |issue=9 |pmid=9496987 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.9.685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[smoke detector]]s, carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the US, NFPA 720-2009,&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=NFPA 720: Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning Equipment|publisher=National Fire Protection Agency|location=Quincy, MA|year=2009|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt; NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt;
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.&lt;ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas Safety in the Home |publisher=UK Gas Safe Register |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012946/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal requirements ===

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law. As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|title=MGL Ch. 148 §28F{{frac|1|2}} – Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006|work=malegislature.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230154311/http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|archivedate=December 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305145343/http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===World Health Organization recommendations===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

For indoor air quality 7&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

The earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; Documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a [[Suicide methods#Carbon monoxide|method of suicide]] date to at least 100 BC in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172025/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work ''Misopogon'': "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside."&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Misopogon'' 341C-D&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]].

[[John Scott Haldane]] identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of [[afterdamp]], the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[canary in a coal mine|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

As part of the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], German [[Nazi]]s used [[gas van]]s at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several [[extermination camp|death camps]] such as [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]] and [[Belzec]]. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in [[action T4]], the programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and [[disabled people]] before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by [[IG Farben]] in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]]. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in the gas vans and the special [[gas chamber]]s used in the [[death camp]]s such as [[Treblinka]]. [[Exhaust fumes]] from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Genocide|vauthors=Totten S, Bartrop P, Markusen E|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|pages=129, 156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526000146/http://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;ots=S8jhBY6NxB&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-05-26|df=|isbn=978-0313346422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt;

==Research==
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the body as a byproduct of converting [[protoporphyrin]] into [[bilirubin]]. This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=R|last2=Bani-Hani|first2=MG|last3=Motterlini|first3=R|title=Use of carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent: promises and challenges.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=649–58|pmid=18286265|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Digitas NewFront''' is an annual [[marketing]] [[Business conference|conference]] first held during [[Internet Week New York]]. Hosted by [[Digitas]] and its brand content entity, The Third Act, the event's stated purpose is to "bring together content creators, distributors, talent and brands to harness creative media opportunities made possible in the age of digital marketing". In 2009, it was broadcast via public webcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewfront.com The NewFronts 2009]. thenewfront.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The event was produced by Amanda Anderson.

==History==
&lt;!-- what about pre-2008 "Digital Content NewFront" history?  Come on. Wikipedia articles are not intended to be proprietary. Discuss in Talk --&gt;
First launched in 2008, the event was titled "Digital Content NewFront". The event title was later shortened to "The NewFront" with the stated mission to "explore and help evolve the brand content and distribution landscape". The event showcased online video content companies like 60 Frames, [[MySpaceTV]], [[MTV New Media]], Generate, [[Next New Networks]] and [[Vuguru]]. Speakers and panelists included [[Michael Eisner]], CEO of Tornate and Vuguru, former Disney CEO and [[Dmitry Shapiro]], the founder of [[Veoh]] Networks.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Caroline (June 5, 2009). [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-9960970-36.html?tag=blog.1 "Who’s afraid of online video? Not Michael Eisner"]. CNET.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the NewFronts ran for one week rather than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shorter NewFronts Highlight Bigger Content Players|last=Lafayette|first=Jon|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=April 30, 2018|pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Displace me X.jpg|thumb|Promotional poster]]

'''Displace Me''' was a nationwide event hosted by the nonprofit [[Invisible Children Inc]]. on April 28, 2007. In 15 cities across the [[United States]], 68,000 individuals came together to raise awareness about the situation of the [[Displaced persons camp|displacement camps]] in northern [[Uganda]].

The event had three main goals:
#To educate participants about displacement camps in the North by simulating, as best as possible, the experience of living in an IDP camp.
#To create greater national and international attention of the humanitarian crises in northern Uganda.
#To garner the political attention needed to see a peaceful resolution to the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]], primarily through the appointment of one senior level U.S. diplomat.

==The event==
Displace Me was created to be an experiential event. To encourage the simulation, participants were asked to bring the following:
*Enough cardboard to build something the size of a small tent.
*A sleeping bag.
*A 1.5-liter bottle of water (with an airtight seal—to be collected upon entry).
*A box of saltine crackers (with sealed packaging—to be collected upon entry).
*A current photo of you wearing a white T-shirt with a red X.

With 15 locations across the United States, participants had to travel long distances to reach their “camps.” The traveling aspect was reflective of the displaced individuals in northern Uganda who were given 48 hours to leave their homes and relocate to displaced camps throughout the region. Once Displace Me participants arrived at their camps, they built “huts” out of cardboard boxes. Throughout the remainder of the night, participants were rationed food and water and heard, via video, personal testimonies from those living in the IDP camps in the North.

Other aspects of the event included a speech at every city from an individual personally connected with the conflict. Speakers included the Gulu District Chairman [[Norbert Mao]], Invisible Children’s Ugandan Country Director '''Jolly Okot''', and the Senior Adviser to the International Crisis Group [[John Prendergast (activist)|John Prendergast]], among others. First Lady [[Laura Bush]] also directly addressed the Displace Me participants via a prerecorded speech shown on video. Participants concluded the night by writing letters to their government leaders and the President of Uganda, calling friends and family who were not aware of the conflict, as well as holding 21 minutes of silence for the 21 years of war.

During the night participants also helped film a video that was to be shown to members of the [[United States Senate]]. Participants in each city held up giant banners with their city's name and one to two phrases from the below statement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">A '''farewell speech''' or '''farewell address''' is a speech given by an individual leaving a position or place. They are often used by public figures such as politicians as a to the preceding career, or as statements delivered by persons relating to reasons for their leaving. The term is often used as a euphemism for "retirement speech", though it is broader in that it may include geographical or even biological conclusion. In the [[Classics]], a term for a dignified and poetic farewell speech is ''apobaterion'' (ἀποβατήριον), standing opposed to the ''epibaterion'', the corresponding speech made upon arrival.

== U.S. presidential farewell addresses ==
Many U.S. presidential speeches have been given the moniker "farewell address" since George Washington's address in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4624166/presidential-farewell-addresses/|title=Barack Obama's Farewell Address and 6 Other Memorable Presidential Goodbyes|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable examples:

* [[George Washington]] – [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] where he warned of the dangers of [[Political party|political parties]] and [[Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances|foreign alliances]].

*[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] – [[Eisenhower's farewell address]] where he warned of the [[military–industrial complex]].
*[[Barack Obama]] – [[Barack Obama's farewell address|Obama's farewell address]] made from Chicago, breaking tradition of holding one in the White House.

==Other notable farewell speeches==

*The speech of [[Aeneas]] to [[Helenus]] and [[Andromache]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book III.
*[[Robert E. Lee]] – [[Lee's Farewell Address]] to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] the day after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].
*[[Douglas MacArthur]] – farewell speeches before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]]; "[[Wikisource:MacArthur's Farewell Speech to Congress|old soldiers never die, they only fade away]]" and "[[Wikisource:Duty, honor, country|duty, honor, country]]".

'''Fictitious''' or '''fake entries''' are deliberately incorrect entries in [[reference work]]s such as [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[encyclopedia]]s, maps, and directories. There are more specific terms for particular kinds of fictitious entry, such as Mountweazel, [[trap street]], paper street, paper town, [[phantom settlement]], and [[:wikt:nihilartikel|nihilartikel]].&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nih1.htm |title=Nihilartikel |publisher=World Wide Words |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictitious entries are included either as a humorous hoax or as a '''copyright trap''' to reveal subsequent [[plagiarism]] or [[copyright infringement]]. 

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''Mountweazel'' was coined by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' based on a fictitious biographical entry in the 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name=mountweazel&gt;Henry Alford, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford "Not a Word"], ''The New Yorker'' August 29, 2005 (accessed August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''nihilartikel'', combining the Latin ''nihil'' ("nothing") and German ''Artikel'' ("article"), is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"/&gt;

== Copyright traps ==
By including a trivial piece of false information in a larger work, it is easier to demonstrate subsequent [[plagiarism]] if the fictitious entry is copied along with other material. An admission of this motive appears in the preface to [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers']] 1964 [[mathematical tables]]: "those [errors] that are known to exist form an uncomfortable trap for any would-be plagiarist".&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Comrie, ''Chambers's Shorter Six-Figure Mathematical Tables'', Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1964, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[trap street]]s may be included in a [[map]], or invented phone numbers in a [[telephone directory]].

Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright (see [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] or ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'', 796 F.Supp. 729, [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992.)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Greguras, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050301065154/http://oikoumene.com/databprotect.html U.S. Legal Protection for Databases], Presentation at the Technology Licensing Forum September 25, 1996. Archived March 1, 2005 on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Official sources ===
Most listings of the members of the [[German parliament]] feature the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]], allegedly a member of the parliament since 1979. Among other activities he is reported to have contributed to a major symposium on the equally fictitious [[stone louse]] in Frankfurt.

=== Reference works ===
Fictitious entries in reference publications often occur in an attempt to catch plagiarism, such as: 

* In August 2005, ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|The New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' gained media coverage&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This later was determined to be the word ''[[esquivalience]]'', defined as "the wilful avoidance of one's official responsibilities," which had been added to the edition published in 2001. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy.
* [[Joel Whitburn]]'s pop chart research books say that [[Ralph Marterie]]'s version of "The Song of Love" peaked at No. 84 for the week ending December 26, 1955. However, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' did not put out an issue that week, and Marterie never recorded this song. A similar situation occurs in his compilation of ''Billboard''{{'}}s rock charts, where Whitburn includes the fictitious song "Drag You Down" by the equally non-existent group "The Cysterz".

=== Maps ===
Fictitious entries on maps may be called [[phantom settlement]]s, [[trap streets]],&lt;ref&gt;SA Mathieson, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/may/11/copyright.epublic "A sidestep in the right direction"], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; paper towns, cartographer's follies, or other names. They are intended to help unmask copyright infringements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-places-that-only-exist-to-catch-copycat-cartog-1695414770 Gizmodo: "Fake places that exist to catch copycats"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1978, the fictional [[Ohio]] towns of [[Beatosu and Goblu]] were inserted into that year's official state of [[Michigan]] map as nods to the [[University of Michigan]] and its traditional rival, [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Monmonier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 |pages= 50–51 |edition=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional town of [[Agloe, New York]], was invented by map makers, but eventually became identified as a real place by its county administration because a building, the Agloe General Store, was erected at its fictional location. The "town" is featured in the novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]].
* Mount Richard, a fictitious peak on the [[continental divide]] in the United States, appeared on county maps in the early 1970s. It was believed to be the work of a draftsman, Richard Ciacci. The fiction was undiscovered for two years.&lt;ref name="Monmonier" /&gt;
* In the United Kingdom in 2001, the [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) obtained a  £20m out-of-court settlement from [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] (the AA) after content from OS maps was reproduced on AA maps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130521130707/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2001/march/centrica.html "Centrica and Ordnance Survey settle AA copyright case"], March 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordnance Survey denied that it included "deliberate mistakes" in its maps as copyright traps, claiming the "fingerprints" which identified a copy were stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark |title=Copying maps costs AA £20m |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictitious English town of [[Argleton]] was investigated by [[Steve Punt]] in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme ''Punt P.I''. The programme concluded that the town's entry may well have originated as a copyright trap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00trzfl ''Punt PI''], BBC Radio 4, September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trivia books, etc. ===

*''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'' placed deliberately false information about the first name of TV detective [[Columbo]] for copy-trap purposes and then sued [[Trivial Pursuit]] (which based some of their questions and answers on the work), without success.

=== Other copyright infringement ===
Other examples of copyright infringement that do not fall under the above categories include: 

* In the summer of 2008, the state-owned Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute ({{lang-sk|Slovenský hydrometeorologický ústav, short: SHMÚ}}) became suspicious that a competing commercial service, the website meteo.sk, was stealing their data. On August 7, 2008, SHMÚ deliberately altered the temperature for [[Chopok]] from 9.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 1&amp;nbsp;°C. In a short time, the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;°C appeared for Chopok at meteo.sk as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.sk/c/4018705/shmu-podozrieva-meteo-ze-opisuje.html SHMÚ suspicious that meteo.sk is stealing their data] News portal SME.sk (in Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] in the Netherlands once deliberately included a false story about a fire in their radio newscast to see if [[Radio Veronica]] takes its news from the ANP. Several hours later, Radio Veronica also aired the story.
* [[Google]], alleging its search results for a misspelling of [[tarsorrhaphy]] started appearing in [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] results partway through the summer of 2010, created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like "[[hiybbprqag]]", "delhipublicschool40 chdjob" and "juegosdeben1ogrande" each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage. Nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by Google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on Bing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=Glenn|title=On Google's Bing Sting|url=https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/on-googles-bing-sting/?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/google-accuses-microsoft-of-stealing-its-search-results-20110202-1acsl.html |title=Bing Copying Google?

== Scrutiny Checks ==
{{see also |List of scholarly publishing stings}}
Some publications such as those published by [[Harvard]] [[biologist]] [[John Bohannon]] are used to detect lack of [[replication crisis|academic scrutiny]], [[peer review | editorial oversight]], [[fraud]] and/or [[p hacking]] on the part of authors or their publishers.  Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).

== Humorous hoaxes ==

=== Reference publications ===
Fictitious entries often occur in reference publications as a prank, or [[practical joke]], in an attempt to be humorous, such as: 

* The [[German language|German-language]] ''[[Der neue Pauly]]. Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sport, ''[[apopudobalia]]'', which resembles modern [[football (soccer)|association football]].
* ''[[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]]'' (1887–1889) contains about two hundred fictitious entries.
* ''[[Zzxjoanw]]'' was the last entry in Rupert Hughes’ ''Music Lovers’ Encyclopedia'' of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a [[Māori language|Māori]] word for a drum. Later, it was proved to be a [[hoax]] (having seemed suspect because Māori does not use the letters J, X or Z).
* The 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' contains a fictitious entry on ''Lillian Virginia Mountweazel'' (1942–1973).&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and [[photographer]], best known for ''Flags Up!'', a collection of photographs of rural American [[Letter box|mailboxes]]. Supposedly she was born in [[Bangs, Ohio]], and died in an explosion while on assignment for ''Combustibles'' magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0320/1224243084358.html "The Life and Times of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel"], Aidan Dunne, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', March 20, 2009. Retrieved March 27 2009 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first printing in 1980 of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' contains two fictitious entries: on Guglielmo Baldini, a non-existent Italian composer, and Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, who purportedly composed a small amount of music for [[flute]]. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in [[Copenhagen]]. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.
* The [[German language|German-language]] medical encyclopedia ''Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch'' features an entry on the ''Steinlaus'' ([[stone louse]]), a rock-eating animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225741.800-the-word-copyright-trap.html The word: Copyright trap] ''New Scientist'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name ''Petrophaga lorioti'' implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]]. The ''Pschyrembel'' entry was removed in 1996 but, after reader protests, was restored the next year, with an extended section on the role of the stone louse in the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].

=== Practical jokes ===
Fictitious entries occasionally feature in other publications in an attempt to be humorous, such as:

*[[Rhinogradentia]] are a fictitious [[mammal]]ian [[Order (biology)|order]], extensively documented in a series of articles and books by the equally fictitious [[Germany|German]] naturalist [[Harald Stümpke]]. Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]], a [[zoology]] professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].
*[[Taro Tsujimoto]] is a fictional character often included in [[Buffalo Sabres]] reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager [[Punch Imlach|George "Punch" Imlach]] designed to fool the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft]]; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later—well after the pick was made official—admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.
*[[Franz Bibfeldt]] is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen's classmate [[Martin Marty]] as an ongoing in-joke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.
* At least two [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|sports teams]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] have long included [[George P. Burdell]], a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of [[Varsity letter|lettermen]] in team media guides:
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Football]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/info-guide-16.pdf |title=All-Time Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Football 2016 Media Guide |page=136 |publisher=Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Men's basketball]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/gtmbb_info_guide_1617.pdf |title=Tech Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Basketball 2016–2017 Information Guide |page=82 |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puzzles/games ===
Many publications have included false items and then challenged readers to identify it, including:
*[[Australia]]n [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Tim Flannery]]'s book ''[[Astonishing Animals]]'' includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.
*The product catalogue for Swedish consumer electronics and hobby articles retailer [[Teknikmagasinet]] contains a fictitious product. Finding that product is a contest, ''Blufftävlingen'', in which the best suggestion for another fictitious product from someone who spotted the product gets included in the next issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |title=Teknikmagasinet – meningen med livet |publisher=Teknik magasinet |language=sv |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |trans-title=Meaning of life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403100827/http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Muse (children's magazine)|Muse]]'', a US magazine for children 10–14, regularly includes a two-page spread containing science and technology news. One of the news stories is false and readers are encouraged to guess which one.
*''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' (a magazine devoted to games and puzzles) used to include a fake advertisement in each issue as one of the magazine's regular games.
*The book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]'' describes many bizarre and obscure films. The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred "Muki the Wonder Dog", named after the authors' own dog

== Fictitious entries in fiction ==
Fictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:

* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, "The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tlön, the setting for much of the country's literature.
* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry "Lillian Mountweazel" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.

== Legal action ==
Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred%20Worth%20lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that "information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.

* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/796/729/1559434/|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co., 796 F. Supp. 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1992)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York Corporation that published and sold a New York City taxi driver's guide entitled ''Official New York Taxi Driver's Guide,'' attempted to sue Hagstrom Map Corporation who published and sold ''New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Drivers Guide,'' that Hagstrom allegedly violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for permanent injunction of their guide, damages, and attorney fees. However, this case was dismissed by the United States Federal Court because it found that fictitious entries (in this case, a "[[trap street]]") are not themselves protected by copyright.
* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that "fictitious names may not be copyrighted" and "the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact."
* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads. 

== Simple Errors ==
Often times there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], "words which have no real existence […] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors."&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Skeat, The Transactions of the Philological Society 1885-7 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1885-7) Vol. II, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

=== Geohazards in Earth's history ===
Eleven distinct [[flood basalt]] episodes occurred in the past 250 million years, resulting in [[large volcanic province]]s, creating [[plateau]]s and [[mountain range]]s on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4866/663 http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1988/1988_Rampino_Stothers_1.pdf|authors=[[Michael R.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

==Biography==
Gigicos is of [[Greece|Greek]] descent and has ancestry from [[Kalamata]]. He studied at [[Birmingham–Southern College]] in Alabama, graduating in 1990. Gigicos worked in advance planning for the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] under President [[George H. W. Bush]] and later worked as an event planner at the [[Orange County Convention Center]] in Florida. He founded a communications firm known as the Telion Corporation in 1999, and also worked for the Republican campaigns of [[George W. Bush]], [[John McCain]], and [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name=greek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.greekreporter.com/2017/01/05/donald-trump-appoints-greek-american-george-gigicos-deputy-assistant-to-the-president/|title=Donald Trump Appoints Greek-American George Gigicos Deputy Assistant to the President|author=Chrysopoulos, Philip|newspaper=[[Greek Reporter]]|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Trump Administration===

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

He is currently the Offensive Coordinator for the University of Tennessee. He is the former head coach of the [[University of Mississippi]]. Freeze served as the head football coach at [[Lambuth University]] from 2008 to 2009 and at [[Arkansas State University]] in 2011. He was previously a successful high school football coach at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he coached [[Michael Oher]] and [[Greg Hardy]]. He would later follow both of them to the University of Mississippi.

==Early life==
Freeze attended [[Senatobia Municipal School District|Senatobia High School]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], from which he graduated in 1992 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] and a minor in coaching and [[sports administration]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.astateredwolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&amp;ATCLID=204944063 Hugh Freeze Bio], Arkansas State University, retrieved December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Briarcrest Christian School===
In 1992, Freeze joined the staff at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], as the football team's [[offensive coordinator]] and [[defensive backs coach]]. Freeze also served as dean of students.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giannotto |first1=Mike|title=At Briarcrest Christian School, Hugh Freeze's legacy is everywhere |url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/2017/07/24/briarcrest-christian-school-hugh-freezes-legacy-everywhere/506677001/ |work=The Commercial Appeal|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he was promoted to head coach. Freeze ran the no huddle spread offense and led his team to the state championship twice, in 2002 and 2004, and the regional championship each year from 1995 to 1998 and in 2001 and 2002. He received Region 8-AA Coach of the Year honors five times and Associated Press Coach of the Year honors six times.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In ten years at Briarcrest, Freeze was 94–30 as head coach (.785 winning percentage) and 126–37 overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213161936/http://briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |archivedate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze was depicted in [[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game|the book]] and motion picture ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'', about one of his former players, current free agent offensive tackle [[Michael Oher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/40483873/ns/sports-college_football/ Oher's HS Coach Gets Top Job at Arkansas State], NBC Sports, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Briarcrest Christian School, Freeze also coached the girls basketball team from 1992 to 2004, and actually had more success in this role, with an overall record of 305–63 (.829 winning percentage), seven straight championship appearances, and four championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/sports/ncaafootball/hugh-freeze-coach-at-ole-miss-follows-an-unlikely-blueprint.html|title=Hugh Freeze, Coach at Ole Miss, Follows an Unlikely Blueprint|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his dismissal from [[Ole Miss]], some former students alleged that Freeze had engaged in inappropriate conduct with female students while at Briarcrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heim|first1=Mark|title=Hugh Freeze stories emerge from former female students at Briarcrest Christian|url=https://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/07/hugh_freeze_stories_emerge_fro.html|work=AL.com|date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peter|first1=Josh|title=Who is Hugh Freeze?

===Ole Miss===
In 2005, the [[University of Mississippi]] hired Freeze as an assistant athletic director for football external affairs. The following season, he became the [[tight ends coach]] and [[recruiting coordinator]], positions he held through 2007.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; After [[2007 Ole Miss Rebels football team|that season]], he replaced head coach [[Ed Orgeron]] on an interim basis before the hiring of [[Houston Nutt]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Freeze interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with Nutt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/13665882.html |title=Nutt Has Long List for New OC |date=January 9, 2008 |work=WTOK.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that eventually went to [[Kent Austin]].

===Lambuth===
In January 2008, [[Lambuth University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), named Freeze its head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambutheagles.com/article/252.php Hugh Freeze Named Lambuth University Head Football Coach], Lambuth University, January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he led Lambuth to an 8–4 record and a first round loss in the NAIA playoffs, marking their first appearance in the playoffs since 2004 under then head coach Vic Wallace. He was considered for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's head coaching position following the 2008 season, but remained at Lambuth University for another season and compiled a 20–5 overall record, and defeating opponents 41–17 on average. In 2009, he led the Eagles to their best regular season record in school history with an unblemished 11–0 mark. Lambuth advanced to the second round of the NAIA playoffs for first time in 11&amp;nbsp;years—having won one game before suffering elimination to finish 12–1 as the sixth-ranked team in the NAIA.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===Arkansas State===
In 2010, he joined the staff at [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] as offensive coordinator after a brief stint as offensive coordinator at [[San Jose State University]] under [[Mike MacIntyre]]. The Red Wolves finished with a 4–8 record, but their offensive rankings jumped from 95th in total offense and 90th in scoring offense in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I FBS]] to 43rd and 46th, respectively. The Red Wolves' offense broke nine school records including total plays (856), first downs (262), pass attempts (438), pass completions (266), completion percentage (.607), passing yards (3,057), passing yards per game (254.8), and passing touchdowns (23). The Red Wolves' offense averaged 403.4 yards per game, eclipsing over 300 yards all 12 times it took the field for the first time in the history of the program. A-State posted at least 400 yards of total offense in seven games during the 2010 campaign, the most ever as an NCAA FBS member, all in his first year as offensive coordinator. After [[2010 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|the season]], Freeze was promoted to replace head coach [[Steve Roberts (American football)|Steve Roberts]].&lt;ref name=hired&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5875374&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NCFHeadlines Hugh Freeze hired at Arkansas St.], ESPN, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, his only season as head coach at Arkansas State, he led the Red Wolves to a 10–2 record and their first Sun Belt Conference title since 2005. The Red Wolves' offense averaged 447.8 ypg (28th nationally, 1st in Sun Belt Conference) including 293.6 ypg passing and 154.2 ypg rushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109125126/http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze left Arkansas State before the Arkansas State's appearance in the [[GoDaddy.com Bowl]] following the season.

===Ole Miss===
On December 5, 2011, Freeze was announced as the 37th head coach of the University of Mississippi. During the press conference to introduce Freeze as the head coach, he stated that he wanted to "retire at Ole Miss." He was signed to a four-year contract with an annual salary of $1.5 million plus incentives up to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="FreezeOMHire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hugh Freeze is Rebels' new coach |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7319777/hugh-freeze-mississippi-rebels-emotional-accepting-coaching-job |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Ole Miss, Freeze led the Rebels to a 6–6 record in the regular season, making Ole Miss bowl eligible for the first time since 2009 with a 41–24 victory over Mississippi State in the [[Egg Bowl]]. His Rebels accepted a bid to play in the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 5, 2013. They beat the University of Pittsburgh 38–17 to finish 7–6.

Freeze received national attention on [[National Signing Day]] 2013 as Ole Miss brought in the fifth ranked recruiting class in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings?class=2013 |title=2013 Football Class Rankings |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeze won the 2014 Grant Teaff Coach of the Year award by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org/2014/01/13/hugh-freeze-named-grant-teaff-coach-of-the-year/ |title=Hugh Freeze named coach of the year by Fellowship of Christian Athletes |work=FCA.org |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Freeze's third season at Ole Miss, he led the Rebels to a 7–0 start, the program's best start since the [[Johnny Vaught]] era. By October, they had risen as high as third in the nation, their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that Ole Miss has won that many games in the regular season. That netted them an appearance in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]]–their first major bowl appearance since the [[1970 Sugar Bowl]], and easily the biggest bowl they had attended since Vaught's tenure.

On September 19, 2015, Freeze's Rebels beat Alabama, 43–37, in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], making Freeze only the third head coach, along with [[Les Miles]] and [[Steve Spurrier]], to defeat a [[Nick Saban]]-coached team in back-to-back years (Michigan's Lloyd Carr beat Saban's Michigan State Spartans in three consecutive years, '96–'98). The victory catapulted the Rebels to #3 in the AP rankings. They went on to tally their second straight nine-win season, and garnered a berth in the [[2016 Sugar Bowl]], where they won 48–20 over [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]]. They finished ninth in the AP Poll and 10th in the Coaches' Poll—their first top-10 finishes in a final poll since 1969.

In January 2016, the NCAA charged Ole Miss with numerous recruiting violations. An investigation turned up evidence that Ole Miss employees and boosters arranged numerous "impermissible benefits" for players, such as car loans and cash. At least one recruit was suspected of getting help on his college entrance exam.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/2/22/14703296/ole-miss-ncaa-allegations-list-2017|title=The updated list of 21 NCAA allegations against Ole Miss football|author=Morgan Moriarty|publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation reopened soon after star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] admitted taking money from one of Freeze's assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laremy Tunsil says he took money from coach at Ole Miss |work=ESPN |date=April 28, 2016 |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/15424437/2016-nfl-draft-laremy-tunsil-admits-taking-cash-ole-miss-rebels-coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017—three months after suffering its first losing season since the year Freeze arrived—Ole Miss withdrew from bowl consideration for the upcoming season. The move came on the same day that the NCAA sent an updated notice of allegations charging the Rebels with eight additional violations. Most seriously, it accused Freeze of not monitoring his assistants, and also accused Ole Miss of not properly controlling the program.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations/&gt;

On July 13, 2017, Freeze's predecessor, [[Houston Nutt]], sued Ole Miss for defamation, contending that Freeze and school officials falsely blamed him for the violations. As part of discovery for the lawsuit, Nutt's attorneys filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request for calls Freeze made on his university-issued cell phone during January 2016. Nutt's attorneys contended that Freeze and others at Ole Miss leaked information to the press as part of an effort to smear their client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-bc-fbc--mississippi-freezes-downfall-20170721-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing those records, Nutt's attorneys discovered a call to a number associated with a female [[escort service]], and alerted Ole Miss officials about it.  Freeze claimed it was a misdialed number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2017/07/20/ole-miss-coach-hugh-freeze-called-number-tied-escort-service/498056001/|title=Ole Miss football coach Hugh Freeze made call to number tied to escort service|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; School officials investigated, and discovered what they later described as "a concerning pattern" of similar calls dating back to shortly after he arrived in Oxford. On July 20, chancellor [[Jeff Vitter]] and athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] gave Freeze an ultimatum: resign or be fired for violating the [[morals clause]] of his contract. Freeze opted to resign; offensive coordinator [[Matt Luke (American football)|Matt Luke]] was named interim coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited |title=Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze resigns; escort-service calls cited |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=July 20, 2017 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |author-link=Mark Schlabach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona Hotshots (AAF)===
On October 11, 2018, Freeze was named as the Offensive Coordinator for the [[Arizona Hotshots]] of the [[Alliance of American Football]].

'''Jessica McClure Morales''' (born March 26, 1986) became famous on October 14, 1987, at the age of 18&amp;nbsp;months after she fell into a [[water well|well]] in her aunt's backyard in [[Midland, Texas]]. Between that day and October 16, rescuers worked for 56 hours to free her from the {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on|spell=in}} [[casing (borehole)|well casing]] {{convert|22|ft|m}} below the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc13.com/30-years-ago-rescue-of-baby-jessica-from-the-well/1555516/|title=30 years ago: Rescue of 'Baby Jessica' from the well|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/18-month-old-girl-saved-1987-article-1.2386153|title=Jessica McClure, an 18-month-old girl, is saved after 58 long hours trapped in a well in 1987 - NY Daily News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained worldwide attention (leading to some criticism as a [[media circus]]), and later became the subject of a 1989 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television movie ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]''.

== Rescue ==
McClure's rescue proved to be a much more difficult ordeal than was first anticipated.  Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling another shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil-drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the  shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the [[jackhammer]]s used were designed for drilling downward, rather than sideways. A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. TV viewers watched as paramedics and rescuers, drilling experts and contractors worked tirelessly to save the baby's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard Jessica singing “[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]” from deep in the well. As long as she was still singing, they knew she was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Darla|title=Baby Jessica 30 Years Later: 'My Life Is a Miracle'|url=http://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-30-years-later-my-life-is-a-miracle/|accessdate=15 October 2017|website=People.com|date=31 May 2017|quote=Television viewers watched as hundreds of paramedics, rescuers, drilling experts and contractors feverishly worked to save the baby's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard Jessica singing “[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]” from deep in the well. As long as she was singing, she was still alive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five hours after McClure fell into the well, the shaft and tunnel were finally completed.

The relatively new technology of [[Water jet cutter|waterjet cutting]], used to cut through the hard rock surrounding the well, was a vital part of the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Week|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-0dAQAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Science Foundation (U.S.)|title=Annual report for fiscal year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EEc-gZcTJkC|year=1987|publisher=The Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Short, a muscular roofing contractor who was born without collar bones because of [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] and so could collapse his shoulders to work in cramped corners, arrived at the site and offered to go down the shaft. They considered his offer, but did not use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= J.

Midland Fire Department paramedic Robert O'Donnell was ultimately able to inch his way into the tunnel and wrestle McClure free from the confines of the well, handing her to fellow paramedic Steve Forbes, who carried her up to safety.

== Media coverage ==
[[CNN]] was on the scene with around-the-clock coverage of the rescue effort. This massive media saturation of the ordeal prompted then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] to state that "everybody in America became godmothers and godfathers of Jessica while this was going on."

From the beginning and throughout the incident, the switchboard of local media outlet [[KMID-TV]] was flooded with telephone calls from news organizations and private individuals around the world, seeking the latest information on rescue efforts. In some cases, they shared their own insight into this and similar incidents.

In 1988, McClure and her parents appeared on ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'' to talk about the incident.

The photograph of McClure being rescued fetched the [[1988 Pulitzer Prize|1988]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography|Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]] to Scott Shaw of the ''[[Odessa American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988 |title= 1988 Winners and Finalists |work= The Pulitzer Prizes |publisher= Columbia University |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC made a television movie of the story in 1989, ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]'', starring [[Patty Duke]] and [[Beau Bridges]]. It featured many participants in the actual rescue and its coverage as extras.

On May 30, 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'' ranked McClure number&amp;nbsp;22 on its list of "25&amp;nbsp;lives of indelible impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koch |first=Wendy |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/top25-people.htm |title=Lives of Indelible Impact |work= [[USA Today]] |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following McClure's rescue on October 16, 1987, surgeons had to amputate a toe due to [[gangrene]] from loss of circulation while she was in the well. She also has a scar on her forehead where her head rubbed against the well casing. She had 15 surgeries over the years and has no first-hand memory of the event.&lt;ref name=Blaney&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www9.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |last= Blaney |first= Betsy |title= Baby Jessica turns 25, gains access to trust fund |work= Xfinity News |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= March 25, 2011 |accessdate= March 25, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110326215656/http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |archivedate= March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced a few years after the rescue.

Paramedic Robert O'Donnell, battling [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] as a result of the arduous rescue effort and struggling to cope with the abrupt decline of the fame and recognition that had been lavished on him following his heroic act, committed suicide in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belkin|first1=Lisa |title=Death on the CNN Curve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/magazine/death-on-the-cnn-curve.html |accessdate=July 18, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=July 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McClure graduated from [[Greenwood Independent School District|Greenwood High School]], in a small community near Midland, in May 2004. On January 28, 2006, nineteen-year-old McClure married Daniel Morales at [[Church of Christ]] in [[Notrees, Texas]], about 40 miles from Midland. They met at a day care center where she worked with his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Celizic |first= Mike |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19165433/ |title= Baby Jessica 20&amp;nbsp;Years Later |publisher= [[MSNBC]] |date= November 6, 2007 |accessdate= November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, a boy born 2007 and a girl born 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-on-the-30-year-anniversary-of-her-rescue-from-a-well-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom/|title=Baby Jessica On the 30 Year Anniversary of Her Rescue from a Well: Her Life as a Wife and Mom|first=Steve|last=Helling|date=October 16, 2017|publisher=[[People magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When McClure turned 25 on March 26, 2011, she received a [[escrow|trust fund]] of donations worth up to $800,000. Her father said she had discussed setting up a trust fund for the college education of her children. It had earlier helped in the purchase of her present home, which is less than {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from the site of the incident.&lt;ref name=Blaney /&gt;

* [[Lucie Brock-Broido]]'s long narrative poem "Jessica from the Well" (1988) tells the story from McClure's point of view, describing her as having a basic understanding of the physical and mythic elements of her situation. It has been reprinted numerous times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Lucie |last= Brock-Broido |chapter= Jessica, from the Well |title= A Hunger |location= New York |publisher=Knopf |year= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-394-56337-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', a heavily fictionalized version of the Jessica McClure story plays out in TV and radio newscasts throughout the film. The entire nation is transfixed as a nine-year-old boy named "Ricky Newman" is believed to have fallen down a well in Fresno, California. Rescuers similarly dig a second well parallel to the one they think he is in, but James Cole (Bruce Willis) tells Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that the boy is, in fact, hiding in a barn. He is later proven right. He knows this because he is a time traveler and remembers the events from when he was a child.

On June 7, 2010, Jesus Mesa Jr., a U.S. Border Patrol agent, shot and killed Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca on the concrete riverbed separating Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and  El Paso, Texas. At the time of the shooting Guereca, a 15-year-old-Mexican national was standing on the Mexican side of the [[US-Mexico border|Mexico–United States border]], while the agent was on the American side. The agent claimed after the shooting that he had used deadly force because Guereca had been throwing rocks.
The shooting led to a protracted court case which examined whether the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th amendment]] protected Guereca's life even though he was not standing on US soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Preston|first=Julia|date=30 June 2014|title=Texas: Panel Rules Agent Can Be Sued Over Shooting Teenager Across Border|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/texas-panel-rules-agent-can-be-sued-over-shooting-teenager-across-border.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 July 2014|title=Court: Mexican family can sue over fatal Border Patrol shooting|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/07/01/court-mexican-family-can-sue-over-fatal-border-patrol-shooting/|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2014|title=Mexican teenager killed by US Border Patrol agents had rights, court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/mexican-teenager-killed-us-border-patrol-agents-constitution|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Inskeep|first=Steve|date=9 Jun 2014|title=After Shootings, Extended Silence: What The Border Patrol Hasn't Said|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/06/09/320220093/foi-request-sheds-some-light-on-border-patrol-shootings|newspaper=[[NPR]]|accessdate=3 Jul 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 February 2017 |title=Supreme Court seems split over Mexican teen's shooting death by Border Patrol agent|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-seems-split-in-case-of-boys-death-near-us-mexico-border/|newspaper=[[CBS]]|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

Since 2017, the movement uses [[W sign]] aka Three Fingers Up as a symbol.

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup 2012==
In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by [[Let's Clean Slovenia|volunteers in Slovenia]] and [[Portugal]].

To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience – Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world. Each group or organisation was leading the cleanup action in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/countries |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==
[[File:Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015.jpg|thumb|Let's Do It! Ukraine 2015]]
The most massive cleanup actions (data: October 2014) within the movement have happened in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo and in Albania.

In 2012, 289,000 '''Slovenians''' came out of the homes and cleaned up the entire country in just one day. This is 14% of the country's population.

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;

|[[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day]] (1835)&lt;br/&gt;"Massacre at Paris" (1600)&lt;ref&gt;Notable for the historically first use of "massacre" in the name of an event, by Marlowe (c. 1600); the name used by Marlowe was "The massacre at Paris". The now-current name of "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day" dates to the first half of the 19th century (Francis Alexander Durivage, ''A Popular Cyclopedia of History'', 1835), translating French 
''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

&lt;!--after 1930 or so, journalistic use of the term "massacre" becomes too indiscriminate to the point of being used synonymously with "murder" or "unjustified killing".
Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Famous historical escapes==
[[File:Famous adventures and prison escapes of the civil war (1893) (14573020789).jpg|{{largethumb}}|On November 27, 1863, [[John Hunt Morgan]] and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron.]]

There have been many infamous escapes throughout history:

===13th century===
* In 1244, whilst imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr]] crafted a make-shift rope made of bed sheets and cloths, lowered it, and climbed down. However, because he was heavy, the rope broke and as a consequence, he fell to his death.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8QY7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=gruffydd+ap+llywelyn+fawr+death+rope&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2i-Gvif7XAhVE-qQKHbfaD2sQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gruffydd%20ap%20llywelyn%20fawr%20death%20rope&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
* In 1621 Dutch author [[Hugo Grotius]] escaped from [[Loevestein|Loevestein Castle]] where he was held captive by hiding himself inside a book chest. He was then smuggled outside.

===18th century===

* Englishman [[Jack Sheppard]] took to theft and burglary in 1723, and was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times, making him a notorious public figure and wildly popular with the poorer classes.
* The Italian author and adventurer [[Giacomo Casanova]] escaped from prison in 1757.

===19th century===
*In the [[Libby Prison Escape]], during the [[American Civil War]], over 109 [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[POWs]] broke out of a building at [[Libby Prison]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] on the night between February 9 and February 10, 1864. All but 50 (two were drowned in the nearby [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]) successfully reached back to Union lines.
*The notorious outlaw [[Billy The Kid]] managed to escape from prison in 1881, but was captured and shot by [[Pat Garrett]] only a few months later.

===1900–1950===
* In 1901, [[Lum You]] was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a [[Pacific County, Washington]] court.  He enjoyed great public sympathy, including from county officials, who supposedly allowed him to escape by leaving his cell door unlocked at night. He eventually seized the opportunity, but within a few days he either gave himself up or was recaptured.&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sydney |last=Stevens |title=Behind Bars in Old Pacific County, 1902: The Hanging of Lum You |newspaper=Chinook Observer |date=June 7, 2011 |url=http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503121544/http://www.chinookobserver.com/news/history/the-hanging-of-lum-you/article_303b3b2a-912f-11e0-a1e7-001cc4c002e0.html |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espy"&gt;{{cite book | first=Willard R. | last=Espy | authorlink=Willard R.

* German Naval Air Service Kapitänleutnant [[Gunther Plüschow]] escaped from the [[Donington Hall]] [[prisoner of war camp]] in 1915.
* [[Frederick Mors]], an Austrian-born American serial killer, was declared insane and placed into the Matteawan Institution for the Insane in the United States in 1915. He escaped in 1916 and was never seen again.
*Leonard T. Fristoe was imprisoned for double murder in 1920 of a police Constable and a deputy Sherriff in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odmp.org/officer/17466-constable-arthur-j-st-clair ODMP memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from Nevada State Prison in 1923. He lived for nearly 46 years under the allias of Claude R. Willis, before being turned in by his own son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-11000/longest-prison-escape/ |title=Longest prison escape |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving several years in prison he died of natural causes .
* [[John Dillinger]] served time at the Indiana State Penitentiary at Michigan City, until 1933, when he was paroled. Within four months, he was back in jail in [[Lima, Ohio]], but his gang sprang him, killing the jailer, Sheriff Jessie Sarber. Most of the gang was captured again by the end of the year in [[Tucson, Arizona]], due to a fire at the Historic Hotel Congress. Dillinger alone was sent to the Lake County jail in [[Crown Point, Indiana]]. He was to face trial for the suspected killing of police officer William O'Malley during a bank shootout in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], some time after his escape from jail. During this time on trial, a famous photograph was taken of Dillinger putting his arm on prosecutor Robert Estill's shoulder when suggested to him by reporters.
* On March 3, 1934, Dillinger escaped from the "escape-proof" (as it was dubbed by local authorities at the time) Crown Point, Indiana county jail, which was guarded by many police officers and national guardsmen. Newspapers reported that Dillinger had escaped using a fake gun made from wood, blackened and shined with shoe polish.
* French prisoner [[René Belbenoît]] escaped from the penal colony of French Guiana on March 2, 1935 when he and five others took to the sea with a boat they had bought. After a series of daring adventures, during which all of the other escapees were captured, he reached United States in 1937. In 1938 his account, ''Dry Guillotine'', was published. Belbenoît had written it in French and it was translated in English by Preston Rambo. It went through 14 printings in less than a year.
* Japanese murderer [[Yoshie Shiratori]] broke out of prison four times between the 1930s and 1940s. A novel and TV-drama ''Hagoku'' was based on his true story.
* [[Fort San Cristóbal (Spain)|Fort San Cristóbal]] is located on the top of the mountain San Cristóbal, which is very close (4&amp;nbsp;km) to [[Pamplona]], [[Spain]]. Built inside the mountain and obsolete since its opening in 1919, due to its weakness against aviation, it served as a prison. On May 22, 1938, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], around 30 prisoners organised a mutiny for a massive prison break. 792 prisoners fled but only three succeeded in getting to the [[France|French]] border; 585 were arrested, 211 died and 14 of the arrested who were considered the leaders were sentenced to death. Most fugitives were intercepted during the following days. In 1988, a sculpture was erected to honour the memory of the Republican people dead there. The fort ceased to be a prison in 1945.
* [[Colditz Castle]] was used as an "escape-proof" prisoner-of-war camp during [[World War II]], but over the course of 300 escape attempts, 130 prisoners escaped.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Thirty escapees eventually managed to reach friendly territory. The men had tunneled, disguised themselves as guards, workmen or women, sneaked away through sewer drains, and even planned to use a glider to get over the wall.
* [[André Devigny]], a French resistance fighter during World War II, escaped [[Fort Montluc|Montluc Military Prison]] in Lyons with his cellmate in April 1943.
* French author [[Henri Charrière]] tried to escape in vain several times, but eventually was successful in 1943. His story, ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'', was published and filmed [[Papillon (1973 film)|under the same name]].
* In [[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]], 76 Allied POWs (primarily Commonwealth airmen) escaped from [[Stalag Luft III]] during World War II. 73 of the escapees were captured and fifty of them were executed by the [[Gestapo]], while only three succeeded in reaching neutral territories.
*In the [[Cowra breakout]], at least 545 out of approximately 1000 Japanese POWs escaped from Number 12 POW Compound at Cowra on the night of 4 August 1944. Out of the roughly 500 escapees, 231 died  and 108 were wounded. 31 killed themselves and 12 were burnt to death in huts set on fire by the Japanese. Sixteen of the wounded showed signs of attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Gavin|year=1963|chapter-url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070308--1-.pdf|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1070206/|title=The Final Campaigns|chapter=Appendix 5 – The Prison Break at Cowra, August 1944|series=Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 1&amp;nbsp;– Army|volume=Volume 7|location=Canberra|publisher=Australian War Memorial|oclc=1297619|pp=623–624}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Great Papago Escape]], over 25 German POWs escaped by tunneling out of [[Camp Papago Park|Camp Papago Park POW facility]], near [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on the night of December 23, 1944. They then fled into the surrounding desert but because the rivers in Arizona were mostly dry and had not been navigable for decades, most of them were recaptured without bloodshed over the next few weeks.
*In the [[Acre Prison break]], 28 members of the Jewish underground groups [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] escaped from [[Acre Prison]] in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Mandatory Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]) on May 4, 1947.

===1950–1975===
*In 1959, [[Frank Freshwaters]] escaped from an Ohio prison while serving a sentence of involuntary manslaughter from a 1957 car accident. After 56 years he was arrested in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/shawshank-redemption-real-frank-freshwater-captured-after-56-years-run-fugitive-1910767 IB Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape|Alcatraz escape on June 11, 1962]], American criminals brothers [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape#John and Clarence Anglin|John and Clarence Anglin]], and [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]] escaped [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] on [[Alcatraz Island]] using an inflatable raft, never to be seen again. It was never determined by the [[FBI]] whether they succeeded in their escape or died in the attempt.
*In 1973, three [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] prisoners escaped in the [[1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape|Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape]], when a hijacked helicopter landed in the exercise yard at [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]].
*In 1975, 28-year-old American convicted [[drug smuggler]] [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]] escaped from a prison in [[İmralı]], [[Turkey]], using a rowboat. He made his way to [[Istanbul]], then to Greece, where he was eventually deported to the U.S. Hayes wrote a book on his experiences, ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'', which was later adapted into the 1978 film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|of the same name]]'' starring [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]] as Hayes.

===1975–1999===
*On 5 April 1976, in the [[Segovia prison break]], twenty nine prisoners escape from prison, in Spain's largest prison break since the country's [[Spanish civil war|civil war]]. The majority belong to the [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] [[separatism|separatist]] group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. The majority of prisoners are recaptured in shoot outs with the authorities in the next few days, during which one escapee is killed, though four manage to escape to France.     
*In 1977, the convicted murderer of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[James Earl Ray]], escaped from Brushy Mountain State Prison in Tennessee, along with six others. Ray was recaptured after two days. He had been running and hiding in the mountainous forest surrounding the prison.
*In 1977, convicted murderer James Robert Jones escaped from prison in Kansas, and lived in Florida for 37 years under the alias of Bruce Walter Keith. He was arrested in March 2014. It is assumed that he used someone else's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11222409 |title=Murderer caught after 37 years on run - World - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1979, [[Assata Shakur]] successfully escaped prison in Union, New Jersey when three members of the Black Liberation Army took prison guards as hostages, freed Assata and fled in a prison van. No one was injured during the prison break, including the guards-turned-hostages who were left in the parking lot. In 1984, Shakur escaped to Cuba where she gained political asylum. Shakur was moved to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List on May 2, 2013.
* On 2 March 1982 in [[Peru]], [[Shining Path|PCP]] guerilla fighters [[Assault of Ayacucho prison|assaulted the Ayacucho prison]], resulting in the release of 255 inmates.
* In the [[1983 Batticaloa Jailbreak]] on 23 September 1983, 41 [[Tamil people|Tamil]] political prisoners and 151 criminal prisoners escaped in eastern [[Sri Lanka]].
* In the [[Maze Prison escape]] on 25 September 1983, 38 [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] members escaped from [[HMP Maze]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the biggest prison escape in Irish or British history.
* In 1984, six death row inmates escaped [[Mecklenburg Correctional Center]], making it the largest mass death row escape in American history. All were recaptured within 18 days, and all six men would eventually be executed. The final execution took place in 1996.
* On 7 March 1993, [[Peter Gibb]] and Archie Butterley escaped from the [[HM Melbourne Assessment Prison|Melbourne Remand Centre]] in Australia, with the help of prison guard Heather Parker who was having a relationship with Gibb. Police found Butterley shot dead six days later, and re-captured Gibb.
* [[Trikala]], [[Greece]], on May 23, 1995, Albanian inmates staged a daring escape from an old Turkish administration building-turned-prison, using weight dumbbells to break the locks of the gates and bed springs as a ladder to scale the wall. 29 prisoners escaped, and about half of them absconded to [[Albania]] and were never recaptured. Only Albanian inmates escaped, having kept escape plans secret from the prison's international population.
* In the [[1995 Vellore Fort Jailbreak]] on 15 August 1995, 43 [[Tamil Tigers|Tamil Tiger]] inmates escaped from [[Vellore Fort]] prison in India.
* In 1998, the Belgian child molester [[Marc Dutroux]] notoriously managed to escape for a few hours. He was caught the same afternoon, but the incident forced two politicians to resign and deepened the loss of faith in the Belgian judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/88889.stm|title=BBC News - EUROPE - Dutroux re-enacts escape|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1999, [[Leslie Dale Martin]] and three other inmates on [[Louisiana]]'s [[death row]] escaped from their cells at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]].  They were caught within hours, before they even managed to escape prison grounds.  The four men had managed the escape with the use of [[hacksaws]] that had been smuggled in for them by a bribed corrections officer.  Other officers were inattentive to the inmates' two to three week effort at cutting their cell doors and window.  After the escape, two corrections officers were fired and two others were demoted.  Two corrections officers later overheard Martin plotting another escape, which included taking hostages and commandeering a vehicle to ram the prison's front gates.  Martin was immediately moved to the holding cell outside the [[death chamber]], a month before his [[execution]] in 2002.

===2000–present===

*Three inmates at an [[Arizona State Prison - Kingman|Arizona State Prison]] for-profit [[Management and Training Corporation]]-operated facility escaped on July 30, 2010. Daniel Renwick and Tracy Province were murderers and John McCluskey had been convicted of attempted murders. Renwick was captured in a shootout in Rifle, Colorado on August 1, 2010. Though he still had 32 years on his sentence in Arizona, he was sentenced to 60 years to be served in Colorado. Province, already a lifer, was captured on August 9, 2010 in Meeteese, Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Inmate Sentenced in Arizona Prison Escape|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/first-inmate-charged-in-arizona-prison-escape-114812684.html|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being sentenced to 38 1/3 years in Arizona, he was quickly extradited to face murder charges in New Mexico. McCluskey, who had been doing consecutive 15-year sentences, was captured with Casslyn Welch, his cousin/accomplice, in eastern Arizona on August 19 in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. He was sentenced to 43 years in an Arizona prison on escape, kidnap, hijacking and robbery charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona inmate gets 43 years for his escape|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/arizona-inmate-gets-43-years-in-prison-after-escape-124114574.html|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Province, Welch and McCluskey were soon extradited for the alleged robbery, hijack and murder of two vacationers in New Mexico.

*On July 11, 2015, Mexican drug lord [[Joaquín Guzmán|Joaquín Guzmán Loera]], also known as 'El Chapo', escaped from Federal Social Readaptation Center No.1, a maximum security prison. His escape involved an elaborate underground tunnel leading from the shower area in his cell stretching 1.5&amp;nbsp;km to a house construction site. The shower area in his cell was not detectable to the security cameras, creating a blind spot. The tunnel lay 10 meters underground and was equipped with a ladder to climb to the bottom, artificial lights, air ducts and various construction materials. A makeshift motorcycle was found in the tunnel, believed to have been used to excavate the tons of earth removed, transport materials and Guzmán himself.

'''Louis Anthony McCall Sr.''' (December 28, 1951 – June 25, 1997) was an American singer, songwriter, drummer, and [[event planner]]. McCall is best remembered as the co-founder and drummer of the American [[Funk]]/[[R&amp;B]] band [[Con Funk Shun]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.last.fm/music/Con+Funk+Shun LastFM - Con Funk Shun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Confunkshun.html Soulwalking - Con Funk Shun]&lt;/ref&gt; which gained fame during the 1970s and 1980s with R&amp;B songs such as: "[[Ffun]]" (1978), "Chase Me" (1979) and "Baby I'm Hooked (Right into Your Love)" (1983). McCall's wife is music business consultant and songwriter Linda Lou McCall. In 1997, McCall was murdered in a home invasion robbery at age 45.

==Career==
===Con Funk Shun===
Louis A. McCall Sr. and singer/guitarist Michael Cooper formed Con Funk Shun as high school students in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=saG0kc0lG7wC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=louis+mccall&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj47pbn-NLUAhWM7IMKHTO-Di04FBDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=louis%20mccall&amp;f=false African Americans in Vallejo – By Sharon McGriff-Payne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxtrafoxxmusic.com/con_funk_shun/|title=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC – Con Funk Shun|work=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC|date=2007-2014|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding members Karl A. Fuller, Paul A. Harrell, Cedric A. Martin, [[Felton C. Pilate]] and Danny A. Thomas, the band started out as a backing group for the [[Soul Children]] under the name Project Soul. They began working with [[Stax Records]] staff songwriters, and while [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] at Audio Dimensions, a sound studio in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, producer Ted Sturges both named the group (after an [[instrumental]] recording by [[The Nite-Liters]]) and produced their first album, ''Organized Con Funk Shun''.

In 1976, Con Funk Shun signed to [[Mercury Records]], releasing eleven albums over a span of ten years. The group's 1977 album, ''Secrets'', was certified [[gold album|gold]] in the U.S., as were ''Loveshine'' (1978), ''Candy'' (1979), and ''[[Spirit of Love]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Search for "Con Funk Shun" performed at [[RIAA]].com on December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They scored a string of [[Top 40|top ten]] [[hit single|hits]] on the [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] black singles [[record chart|chart]], including "Ffun" (#1 in 1977), "Shake and Dance with Me" (#5 in 1978), "Chase Me" (#4 in 1979), "Got to Be Enough" (#8 in 1980) and "Too Tight" (#8 in 1981). Tensions from within the group built over the 1980s, and the group's final album, ''Burning Love'', was recorded without songwriter and vocalist [[Felton Pilate]], who had left Con Funk Shun following a physical altercation involving McCall.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; The band let McCall go after he missed two concert dates in order to deal with medical problems resulting from a teenage car crash.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; After leaving Mercury Records, the band broke up in 1986, but some members of the group reunited alongside touring musicians for concerts in the 1990s.

===Later career===
After leaving Con Funk Shun in 1986, McCall joined forces with his wife, a music business consultant, and started an artist management company in the [[Washington, DC]] area. In 1989, they discovered [[Keith Martin (musician)|Keith Martin]], an aspiring R&amp;B artist, and signed on as his managers. When Linda Lou McCall was hired by rapper [[MC Hammer]] in 1990, the McCalls put Martin on Hammer's ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em]]'' tour as a backup musician and vocalist, which launched Martin's career in the music industry. In 1992, Linda Lou formed her own company, The Entertainment Qartel, Inc. (EQartel), specializing in music business administration and entertainment marketing and promotions.&lt;ref name=LindaLou&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxtrafoxxmusic.com/linda_lou_mccall.html|title=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC – Linda Lou McCall CEO|work=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC|date=2007-2014|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to doing radio promotion for EQartel's Atlanta-based street team, the Rhyme Scene Unit, McCall also became a successful event planner, most notably producing a celebrity benefit for actor/activist [[Danny Glover]] at [[Fairmont San Francisco|The Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco]] in January 1993.

==Death and aftermath==
On June 25, 1997, Louis McCall was found murdered outside a friend's home in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]], the apparent victim of a home-invasion robbery.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; His wife, Linda Lou, fought to keep the case active for eleven years, even asking the Governor of Georgia to assist in reopening the case in 2003. Finally, a suspect was indicted in 2007 in connection with the murder, but it took another year before the case made it to trial on July 21, 2008, with 29-year-old Marques Clair as defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson |first=David |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/07/21/mccall.html?cxntlid=inform_sr/ |title=Trial starts today in musician's '97 death |date=July 21, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525001311/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/07/21/mccall.html?cxntlid=inform_sr%2F |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clair was originally arrested with another suspect in McCall's slaying in 1999, but prosecutors had dropped the charge due to the District Attorney's refusal to bring the case before a jury with insufficient evidence.

Just two days after the start of Clair's murder trial, the proceedings were halted by Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams. A spokeswoman for the DeKalb County Georgia district attorney's office, Jada Hudspeth, stated that the suspension of the trial was "based on an omission" of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simpson |first=David |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2008/07/24/slain_musician_mistrial.html |title=Mistrial declared in case of slain musician |date=July 24, 2008 |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604101702/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2008/07/24/slain_musician_mistrial.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudspeth said that District Attorney, Gwen Keyes Fleming, and her staff would evaluate the evidence in the case before deciding whether to retry Clair. On August 7, 2008, after a mistrial was declared, the charges against Clair were formally [[dismissal with prejudice|dismissed with prejudice]].

==Legacy==
In recognition of the fact that Louis McCall was born in Alameda, CA, his name was chosen by the Alameda City Planning Board in April 2014 for naming one of the streets in the proposed residential community, Alameda Landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boitano |first=Dave |url=http://thealamedan.org/news/navy-loses-battle-over-street-names |title=Navy loses battle over street names |publisher=The Alamedan |date=April 29, 2014 |access-date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2014, Louis McCall and the other six members of Con Funk Shun were honored by the National R&amp;B Music Society with a Lifetime Achievement Award at a black tie dinner and award ceremony in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnbmusicsociety.com/#!4th-black-tie-gala-award-cerem/c10cc The National R&amp;B Music Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823055009/http://www.rnbmusicsociety.com/#!4th-black-tie-gala-award-cerem/c10cc |date=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, McCall's wife Linda Lou was presented with the "Unsung Heroine" award for her key role in the success of Con Funk Shun and her continued role in keeping the group's legacy alive, in addition to her tireless contribution to R&amp;B music for over four decades.&lt;ref name=LindaLou/&gt;

As well as being the band's leader, responsible for booking many of their most lucrative tours, Louis (along with Linda Lou) wrote several songs for Con Funk Shun, including "California 1", "Bad Lady", and "Honey Wild" (co-written with Con Funk Shun member Danny Thomas). In 2007, "Honey Wild", from the 1980 ''Spirit of Love'' album, was sampled by [[Lil Wayne]] for his Grammy Award-winning CD ''[[Tha Carter III]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1968, at the age of sixteen, McCall was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Vallejo, California.&lt;ref name="unsung"&gt;"Con Funk Shun."  ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]''. Exec. Prod. Frank Sinton, Arthur Smith, and Kent Weed. Co-Exec. Prod. Mark Rowland. Nar. Gary Anthony Williams. TV One, 9. Jul. 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12202">A '''media monitoring service''', a '''press clipping service''' or a '''clipping service''' as known in earlier times, provides clients with copies of media content, which is of specific interest to them and subject to changing demand; what they provide may include documentation, content, analysis, or editorial opinion, specifically or widely. These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor.  The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded with the advent of [[telegraphy]] and [[submarine communication cable|submarine cables]] in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of [[radio]], [[television]], the [[photocopier]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Though media monitoring is generally used for capturing content or editorial opinion, it also may be used to capture advertising content.

Media monitoring services have been variously termed over time, as new players entered the market, new forms of media were created, and as new uses from available content developed.  An existing group may provide such a monitoring service, as it relates to their main purpose, while a monitoring agency generally provides such as their main business.  Alternative terms for these monitoring services as well as the information they provide include:

*Press clipping service or agency
*Media cutting service or agency
*[[Information logistics]] service
*[[Media intelligence]]
*Media information services

==History==
{{See also|Imprimatur}}
Since [[mass media]] traditionally was limited solely to print media, naturally the monitoring was also limited to these media. The world's first press clipping agency was established in [[London]] in 1852 by a Polish newsagent named Romeike. Actors, writers, musicians and artists would visit his shop to look for articles about themselves in his Continental stock. It was then that Romeike realised that he could turn this into a profitable business. 

An agency named "L'Argus de la presse" was established in Paris in 1879 by Alfred Cherie, who offered a press-clipping service to Parisian actors, enabling them to buy reviews of their work rather than purchasing the whole newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history Media Monitors Interactive history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430192851/http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[radio]] and later [[television]] broadcasting were introduced in the 20th century, press clipping agencies began to expand their services into the monitoring of these broadcast media, and this task was greatly facilitated by the development of commercial audio and video tape recording systems in the 1950s and 1960s. With the growth of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s, media monitoring service extended their services to the monitoring of online information sources using new digital search and scan technologies to provide output of interest to their clients.

Then, in 1998, the now defunct WebClipping&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webclipping.com WebClipping website]&lt;/ref&gt; website was the first firm to start monitoring Internet based news media, moving the industry toward tracking digital news quickly.

Typically, individual or organisational clients &amp;ndash; e. g. private companies and corporations, charities, government departments and ministries &amp;ndash; will subscribe to a media monitoring service to keep track of what is being said about them, their field of operations, their competitors, or other specified topics of interest.

==Industry==
The news monitoring industry provides government agencies, corporations, public relations professionals, and other organizations access to news information created by the media. Generally monitoring print, broadcast, and internet [[digital content|content]] for any mention of specific subjects of interest, a news monitoring company will analyze and provide feedback to their client in the form of press clippings, monitoring reports, and media analysis.

==Evolution==

From a cut &amp; clip service, media clipping today has expanded to incorporate technology with information.  Media monitoring clients can now opt to include print, broadcast and online to capture all their media exposure.  While this technology has allowed some of the process to be automated, many media monitoring agencies still offer the services of trained professionals to review and validate results.

Service delivery happens at three fronts. Clients may get their original hard copy clips through traditional means (mail/overnight delivery) or may opt for digital delivery.  Digital delivery allows the end user to receive via email all the relevant news of the company, competition and industry daily, with updates as they break.  The same news may also be indexed (as allowed by copyright laws) in a searchable database to be accessed by subscribers. Another option of this service is auto-analysis, wherein the data can be viewed &amp; compared in different formats.

Every organization that uses PR invariably uses news monitoring as well. In addition to tracking their own publicity, self-generated or otherwise, news monitoring clients also use the service to track competition or industry specific trends or legislation, to build a contact base of reporters, experts, leaders for future reference, to audit the effectiveness of their [[PR campaign]]s, to verify that PR, [[marketing]] and sales messages are in sync, and to measure impact on their target market. City, State, and Federal agencies use news monitoring services to stay informed in regions they otherwise would not be able to monitor themselves and to verify that the public information disseminated is accurate, accessible in multiple formats and available to the public. Some monitoring services specialize in one or more areas of press clipping, TV and radio monitoring, or [[internet tracking]]. Media analysis is also offered by most news monitoring services.

Television news monitoring companies, especially in the United States, capture and index [[closed captioning]] text and search it for client references. Some TV monitoring companies employ human monitors who review and abstract program content; other services rely on automated search programs to search and index stories.

Online media monitoring services utilize automated software called [[web spider|spiders]] or robots (bots) to automatically monitor the content of free online news sources including newspapers, magazines, trade journals, TV station and news syndication services.  Online services generally provide links but may also provide text versions of the articles.  Results may or may not be verified for accuracy by the online monitoring service.  Most newspapers do not include all of their print content online and some have web content that does not appear in print.

In the United States, there are trade associations formed to share best practices which include the North American Conference of Press Clipping Services and the International Association of Broadcast Monitors.

==Language and media – the big challenges==

In English speaking countries, the service of media monitoring, [[collation]] &amp; [[dissemination]] is fairly simple and most organizations which use [[Public Relations]] also use media monitoring. However, in multi-language &amp; multi-dialect countries the challenge of collating data locally and disseminating in a [[language translation|translated]] language of business (usually English) is a daunting task. The situation in other multi-language countries is no different.

The second large challenge for Information Logistics is the growing number of media and the media types. For example, in a country like [[media in India|India]] there are over 50,000 registered print publications, 250+ TV channels, a growing number of relevant internet sites and several hundred new blogs that need to be captured every day. Several of these need to be translated for a 'heads-up' and analysis needs to be constant and real-time.

===Illustrative examples===
An author that recently published a book and who has a strong interest in tracking how well the book is received by [[critic]]s may hire a media monitoring service. The service will have a method by which they extract any information about the author and their book from newly printed [[magazine]]s, radio programs, television programs and so on. The author will receive a printed bundle of ''clippings'', i.e., the pages of the magazines and [[newspaper]]s relating to them and their book.  They may also receive recordings of any radio reviews, television programs and so on, which refer to his book.

Most major companies and corporations subscribe to media monitoring services to keep track of any reports or comments in the media. A fast food company, for example, would receive summaries of coverage and/or copies of material drawn from a wide range of sources, including TV and radio news reports, commentaries on TV and radio shows, newspaper opinion/commentary columns, magazine articles and internet [[blog]]s.

The material collected would include any media items that relate to the company's commercial operations, its corporate [[reputation management|reputation]] or its media image. This would include reports about or discussions of the [[fast food industry]] in general, and any media item that specifically mentions the company, its clients and suppliers, its competitors or related interest groups or other specified subjects of interest, such as food/health regulations.

===Trade groups===
The [[International Association of Broadcast Monitors]] (IABM) is a worldwide [[trade association]] made up of news retrieval services which record, monitor and archive broadcast news sources including television, radio and internet.  It acts as a "clearinghouse" or "forum" for discussion on topics of collective concerns and acts as a united voice for the news monitoring industry.

===Professional organization===
[[FIBEP]] (Federation Internationale des Bureaux d’Extraits de Presse/International Federation of the Press Clipping Services) is a professional media monitoring organization. The FIBEP was established in 1953 in [[Paris]] and has close to 100 members from 44 countries. Every 18 months, the members of FIBEP members organize a three-day FIBEP-Congress. In work groups, workshops, reports and discussion circles, members discuss market trends.

==Law cases==
{{main|Associated Press v. Meltwater|Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)}}
Two parallel cases developed in 2012, [[Associated Press v. Meltwater|one in the United States]], and [[Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)|one in the United Kingdom]]. In each case, the legality of temporary copies and the online media monitoring service offered to clients, was in dispute. Essentially the two cases covered the same issue (media clippings shown to clients online) and with the same defendant, [[Meltwater Group]]. The plaintiff differed, being [[List of copyright collection societies|a UK copyright collection society]] (UK) rather than [[Associated Press]] (US), but upon parallel grounds.

The activity was ruled unlawful in the US (under the "[[fair use]]" doctrine) and lawful in the UK (under UK and EU copyright law, in summary on the basis that mere viewing is never an infringement, and temporary copies to enable a lawful purpose are themselves lawful).

== Background and official line-up ==
Originally, it was supposed to be a Brazilian version of the famous German [[Wacken Open Air]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; However, the promoters failed to obtain official permission to use the name, so they decided to switch it for Metal Open Air.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; From that moment on, several bands, including [[Shaman (Brazilian band)|Shaman]], [[Megadeth]], [[Symphony X]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],&lt;ref name="vírgula"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sem shows nem estrutura, Metal Open Air é cancelado|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/festivais-de-musica/2012/04/21/298723-sem-shows-nem-estrutura-metal-open-air-e-cancelado|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=[[Universo Online|Vírgula]]|date=21 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; started to confirm their performances, though a few have cancelled, including [[Shadowside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salzano Jr|first=Costábile|title=Metal Open Air: Shadowside cancela participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/147389-krisiun.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=3 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krisiun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Krisiun cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_840/152194-metalopenair.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=12 April 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volbeat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: Volbeat cancela sua participação no evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_843/146543-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=23 January 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly for logistical reasons.

By February/March 2012, the official announced line-up was as follows (act names in '''bold''' are headliners; El Diablo is an entertainment group that prepared rock night parties after every headliner performance):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Metal Open Air: anunciada a programação oficial do evento|url=http://whiplash.net/materias/news_842/148537-metalopenair.html|accessdate=19 March 2013|newspaper=Whiplash.net|date=17 February 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headliners of the second day, the [[Rock and Roll All Stars]], were a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] composed of [[Gene Simmons]], [[Joe Elliott]], [[Matt Sorum]], [[Duff McKagan]] , [[Gilby Clarke]], [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Ed Roland]], [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Mike Inez]], [[Billy Duffy]] and [[Charlie Sheen]], who was to be the festival's [[master of ceremonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Sheen convida para o Metal Open Air, que ocorre a partir de 20 de abril no Maranhão|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2012/04/09/charlie-sheen-convida-para-o-metal-open-air-que-ocorre-a-partir-de-20-de-abril-no-maranhao.jhtm|publisher=[[Universo Online|UOL Música]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Paulo|language=Portuguese|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The festival and the cancellations ==
[[File:Symphony x 2004.tiff|thumb|right|220px|[[Michael Romeo]] (left) and [[Russell Allen]] (right); Symphony X was among the very few bands that managed to make a performance at the festival.]]

Shortly before and even during the festival, several bands cancelled their performances. British thrash band Venom, for example, had their [[Visa (document)|visas]] sent to Africa instead of Brazil by mistake,&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; thus making it impossible for them to take part of MOA and two other South American festivals. [[Hansi Kürsch]], vocalist for German power metal quartet Blind Guardian, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air 2012 performance cancelled|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/04/21/metal-open-air-2012-performance-cancelled/|publisher=Official Blind Guardian website|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|date=21 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''In 25 years of our career we [...] have been extremely successful in the avoidance of cancelled shows, so far. This unfortunately comes to a very sad end here in São Luís. Due to massive technical and administrative problems we were forced to cancel tonight's show. As far as we understand it seems to be the local management who has not been able to secure a proper festival environment, anymore. Things are pretty out of hand there. We feel very sorry about this totally unsatisfying situation, but the mistakes made by the local promoter makes an even improvised show impossible. [...] In the future we will be more careful in confirming such festivals.''}}

[[Aquiles Priester]], from Hangar, also cancelled his band's participation, stating:&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

{{cquote|''We negotiated everything via oral conversation, but we made ourselves very much clear that we needed the total cash before our performance, since we needed to pay our trip to São Luís in our very own bus. We wouldn't accept, by any means, to play without our backline. So far, we were paid with only 25% of the cash to cover all our expenses (fuel, accommodation and food for the band and crew), we needed at least 75%.''}}

Terra Prima's members didn't receive their air tickets to São Luís nor the confirmation of their accommodations in the city.&lt;ref name=exame/&gt;

Symphony X, one of the few bands that managed to take on the stage and perform, posted a note some days later, thanking their fans for the show and criticizing the event's structure:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Open Air|url=http://www.symphonyx.com/site/news/metal-open-air/|publisher=Official Symphony X website|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''We want to thank the fans for sticking it out on Friday night! We were extremely close to having to cancel the show due to technical reasons and did not know if we would even play for sure until an hour before the set, which had already been delayed two hours. The lack of organization and chaos surrounding the event, which had also been noted by the media, had forced many bands to cancel. This is unfair to the fans in attendance, and unfortunately these fans were robbed of many performances.''}}

[[Dave Mustaine]], from Megadeth, also thanked his fans and regretted the festival's organization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Megadeth Mainman On Brazil's METAL OPEN AIR: 'We Were Playing For The People'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=172916|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''To the fans last night in São Luís, thank you. It's all I can say. One Big Mega Thank You! Yesterday's show in Sao Luis was very challenging, but we did it! [...] I was told a lot of the talent opted out from coming. I was also told the tickets cost $450 [[Brazilian real]] for the three-day weekend, and $250 BRL for just one day. The average person in this area makes $28 BRL a day, so you can do the math. [...] We were playing, no matter what. We weren't playing for the promoter anymore; we were playing for the people!''}}

[[Ricardo Confessori]], drummer for [[Shaman]], publicly contested Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] for canceling the band's performance at the festival, accusing him of not giving a good excuse for  the fans, to which Ian replied that the problem was "the whole terrible organization. We never want to cancel but they made it impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Scott_Ian/status/193877446603448320 Confessori's and Ian's discussion] at [[Twitter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, a total of 30 of the 47 invited bands cancelled their performances due to the severe logistical, structural and financial problems regarding the festival.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; As for the fans, some had to camp inside [[stable]]s, with almost no electricity, lack of places to buy food, beverage and hygiene products and only one public toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freire|first=Pedro Henrique|title=Estábulos para cavalos viram área de camping para o público|url=http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml|publisher=O Imparcial|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=20 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524014607/http://www.oimparcial.com.br/app/noticia/especiais/metal-open-air/2012/04/20/interna_metal,113830/estabulos-para-cavalos-viram-area-de-camping-para-o-publico.shtml#|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbosa|first=Alex|title=

Soon after MOA was cancelled, both companies responsible for the festival (Negri Concerts and Lamparina Filmes e Produções) accused each other of breaking contractual rules.&lt;ref name=negrivslamparina&gt;{{cite web|last=Louise|first=Aline|title=Produtoras do Metal Open Air trocam acusações em cartas abertas|url=http://musica.terra.com.br/produtoras-do-metal-open-air-trocam-acusacoes-em-cartas-abertas,fa3cbbd670a5a310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|publisher=Terra|accessdate=19 March 2013|location=São Luís|language=Portuguese|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological hazard]]s can refer to a diverse array of [[disease]], [[infection]], [[infestation]] and [[invasive species]].

Many geophysical hazards are related;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gill|first1=Joel C.|last2=Malamud|first2=Bruce D.|title=Reviewing and visualizing the interactions of natural hazards|journal=[[Reviews of Geophysics]]|date=December 2014|volume=52|issue=4|pages=680–722|doi=10.1002/2013RG000445|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013RG000445/abstract|bibcode=2014RvGeo..52..680G}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[submarine earthquake]]s can cause [[tsunami]]s, and [[hurricane]]s can lead to [[coastal flood]]ing and [[coastal erosion|erosion]]. Floods and wildfires can result from a combination of geological, [[hydrology|hydrological]], and climatic factors. It is possible that some natural hazards are intertemporally correlated as well.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Philip E.|last2=Bresnock|first2=Anne E.|title=Are Natural Hazards Temporally Random?|journal=[[Applied Geography]]|date=1 January 1985|volume=5|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1016/0143-6228(85)90002-5|ssrn=1679224}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the distinction between a natural ''hazard'' and a [[natural disaster|natural ''disaster'']] is that the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] was a disaster, whereas living on a [[fault (geology)|fault]] line is a hazard.

==Geological hazards==
{{Main article|Geohazard}}

===Avalanche===
An avalanche occurs when a large snow (or rock) mass slides down a mountainside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snow avalanches|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science/avalanches.html|website=All about snow|publisher=National Snow &amp; Ice Data Center|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An avalanche is an example of a gravity current consisting of granular material. In an avalanche, lots of material or mixtures of different types of material fall or slide rapidly under the force of gravity. Avalanches are often classified by the size or severity of consequences resulting from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Public Avalanche Danger Scale|url=http://www.avalanche.org/danger_card.php|website=Avalanche.org|publisher=American Avalanche Association|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake===
{{See also|Lists of earthquakes|Soil liquefaction}}
[[Image:Sanfranciscoearthquake1906.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco]] was devastated by an [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]] in 1906]]
An [[earthquake]] is the sudden relof energy stored as lithospheric stress that radiates [[seismic wave]]s. At the [[Earth]]'s surface, earthquakes may manifest with a shaking or displacement of the ground; when the [[earthquake]] occurs on the seafloor, the resulting displacement of water can sometimes result in a [[tsunami]]. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-km-long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the [[Pacific Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Simkin, Tom|display-authors=3|author2=Tilling, Robert I.|author3=Vogt, Peter R.|author4=Kirby, Stephen H.|author5=Kimberly, Paul|author6=Stewart, David B.|title=This Dynamic Planet: World map of volcanoes, earthquakes, impact craters, and plate tectonics|date=2006|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey Map I-2800|isbn=1-411-30959-6|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|accessdate=18 July 2014|archiveurl=http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/|archivedate=7 Jan 2014|format=map}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many earthquakes happen each day, few of which are large enough to cause significant damage.

===Coastal erosion===
[[Coastal erosion]] is a physical process by which shorelines in coastal areas around the world shift and change, primarily in response to waves and currents that can be influenced by tides and storm surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Komar|first1=Paul D.|title=CRC handbook of coastal processes and erosion|date=1983|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=9780849302251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal erosion can result from long-term processes (see also [[beach evolution]]) as well as from episodic events such as [[tropical cyclone]]s or other severe storm events.

===Lahar===
A [[lahar]] is a type of natural event closely related to a [[volcanic eruption]], and involves a large amount of material originating from an eruption of a glaciated volcano, including mud from the melted ice, [[rock (geology)|rock]], and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] sliding down the side of the [[volcano]] at a rapid pace. These flows can destroy entire towns in seconds and kill thousands of people, and form [[flood basalt]].
This is based on natural events.

===Landslide===
A [[landslide]] is a mass displacement of sediment, usually down a slope. It can be caused by pressure pulling natural objects down a declining hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Nicholas K.|title=Geohazards: natural and human|date=1995|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=9780023229923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinkhole===
A [[sinkhole]] is a localized depression in the surface topography, usually caused by the collapse of a subterranean structure such as a [[cave]]. Although rare, large sinkholes that develop suddenly in populated areas can lead to the collapse of buildings and other structures.

===Volcanic eruption===
[[Image:Puu Oo cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puʻu ʻŌʻō]]]]
A [[volcanic eruption]] is the point in which a [[volcano]] is active and releases its power, and the eruptions come in many forms. They range from daily small eruptions which occur in places like [[Kilauea]] in [[Hawaii]], to megacolossal eruptions (where the volcano expels at least 1,000 cubic kilometers of material) from supervolcanoes like [[Lake Taupo]] (26,500 years ago) and [[Yellowstone Caldera]]. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]], 70 to 75 thousand years ago, a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] event at [[Lake Toba]] reduced the human population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in [[human evolution]]. Some eruptions form [[pyroclastic flows]], which are high-temperature clouds of ash and steam that can travel down mountainsides at speed exceeding an airliner.

==Meteorological or climate hazards==
[[Image:Young steer after blizzard - NOAA.jpg|thumb|Young steer after a blizzard, March 1966]]

===Blizzard===
A blizzard is a severe winter storm with icy and windy conditions characterized by low temperature, strong wind and heavy snow.

===Drought===
A drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or ground water.
Scientists warn that [[global warming]] and  [[climate change]] may result in more extensive [[drought]]s in coming years. These extensive droughts are likely to occur within the African continent due to its very low precipitation levels and high temperatures.

===Hailstorm===
A [[hail]]storm is a natural hazard where a thunderstorm produces numerous [[hailstone]]s which damage the location in which they fall. Hailstorms can be especially devastating to [[farm]] fields, ruining crops and damaging equipment.

===Heat wave===
A [[heat wave]] is a hazard characterized by [[heat]] which is considered extreme and unusual in the area in which it occurs. Heat waves are rare and require specific combinations of [[weather]] events to take place, and may include [[temperature inversion]]s, [[katabatic winds]], or other phenomena. There is potential for longer-term events causing [[global warming]], including [[stadial]] events (the opposite to glacial "ice age" events), or through human-induced climatic warming.

===Cyclonic storm===
Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure.
[[Image:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Katrina]]]]
[[Hurricane]], [[tropical cyclone]], and [[typhoon]] are different names for the cyclonic [[storm]] system that forms over the oceans. It is caused by evaporated [[water]] that comes off of the [[ocean]] and becomes a [[storm]]. The [[Coriolis effect]] causes the storms to spin.{{convert|74|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Hurricane'' is used for these phenomena in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]s, ''tropical cyclone'' in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], and ''typhoon'' in the western [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].

===Ice storm===
An [[ice storm]] is a particular [[weather]] event in which precipitation falls as [[ice]], due to [[atmospheric|atmosphere]] conditions. It causes damage.

===Tornado===
A [[tornado]] is a natural disaster resulting from a [[thunderstorm]]. Tornadoes are violent, rotating columns of air which can blow at speeds between {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and possibly higher. Tornadoes can occur one at a time, or can occur in large [[tornado outbreak]]s associated with [[supercell]]s or in other large areas of thunderstorm development. [[Waterspout]]s are tornadoes occurring over tropical waters in light rain conditions.

===Climate change===

[[Climate change]] can increase or decrease weather hazards, and also directly endanger property due to [[sea level rise]] and biological organisms due to [[habitat]] destruction.

===Geomagnetic storm===

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disrupt or damage technological infrastructure, and disorient species with [[magnetoception]].

==Flood==
A [[flood]] results from an overflow of water beyond its normal confines of a body of water such as a lake, or the accumulation of water over land areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Flood|website=Meteorology glossary|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildfire==
[[Wildfire]] is a fire that burns in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner. Wildfires can result from natural occurrences such as lightning strikes or from human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildfire|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/wildfire|website=Cambridge dictionaries online|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease==
[[Disease]] is a natural hazard that can be enhanced by human factors such as [[urbanization]] or poor [[sanitation]].  Disease affecting multiple people can be termed an [[outbreak]] or [[epidemic]].

In some cases, a hazard exists in that a human-made defense against disease could fail, for example through [[antibiotic resistance]].

==Multi-hazard analysis==
Each of the natural hazard types outlined above have very different characteristics, in terms of the spatial and temporal scales they influence, hazard frequency and [[return period]], and measures of intensity and impact. These complexities result in "single-hazard" assessments being commonplace, where the hazard potential from one particular hazard type is constrained. In these examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative is a "multi-hazard" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11069-012-0294-2 | doi=10.1007/s11069-012-0294-2 | volume=64 | title=Challenges of analyzing multi-hazard risk: a review | journal=Natural Hazards | pages=1925–1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;

Many examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an [[earthquake]] may trigger [[landslides]], whereas a [[wildfire]] may increase the probability of landslides being generated in the future.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  A detailed review of such interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of varying likelihood and spatial importance.&lt;ref name="Gilletal2014"/&gt;  There may also be interactions between these natural hazards and [[anthropic]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-3049.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[groundwater]] abstraction may trigger [[groundwater-related subsidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthgwlandsubside.html|title=Land Subsidence|work=USGS Water Science School|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective [[hazard analysis]] in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of [[disaster risk reduction]]) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to [[risk assessment]] wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for [[seismic risk]], where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from [[Wind engineering|extreme wind]] and to a lesser extent [[Flood risk assessment|flood risk]]. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=J.|date=2007-04-05|title=Physical vulnerability modelling in natural hazard risk assessment|url=http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/7/283/2007/|journal=Nat.

==International campaigns==
In 2000, the [[United Nations]] launched the [[International Early Warning Programme]] to address the underlying causes of vulnerability and to build disaster-resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of the importance of [[disaster risk reduction]] as an integral component of [[sustainable development]], with the goal of reducing human, economic and environmental losses due to hazards of all kinds (UN/ISDR, 2000). 

The 2006-2007 United Nations International Disaster Reduction Day theme was “Disaster reduction education begins in school”. The Foundation of Public Safety Professionals launched an international campaign with an international open essay or documentary competition.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Old Home Week''' or '''Old Home Day''' is a practice that originated in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]] similar to a harvest holiday or festival.  In its beginning in the 19th–20th century it involved a municipal effort to invite former residents of a village, town, or city—usually individuals who grew up in the municipality as children and moved elsewhere in adulthood—to visit the "Old Home", the parental household and home town. Some municipalities celebrate the holiday annually, while others celebrate it every few years.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the practice has spread to other parts of [[North America]] and has become a broader celebration with an emphasis on local culture and history. From the [[Wilmington, Vermont]] town web site:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Town of Wilmington | authorlink = Wilmington, Vermont | title = Old Home Week 2010 | url = http://www.wilmingtonvermont.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B7F6E5A89-A189-4E95-8300-50B76E0DC660%7D | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pope Joan''', 855–857, (''Ioannes Anglicus'') was, according to popular legend, a woman who reigned as [[pope]] for a few years during the [[Middle Ages]]. Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe. The story was widely believed for centuries, but most modern scholars regard it as fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boureau |first=  Alain|translator= Lydia G.

X. |date= April 2013 |title= Why Pope Joan? |journal= Catholic Historical Review|publisher= |volume= 99|issue= 2|pages= 219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover. In the most common accounts, due to her abilities, she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession, and she died shortly after, either through murder or natural causes. The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot, and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 1–2|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

[[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle, written around 1250, contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope, and it inspired several more accounts over the next several years. The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'', later in the 13th century. Martin introduced details that the female pope's birth name was John Anglicus of [[Mainz]], that she reigned in the 9th century, and that she entered the church to follow her lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |pages= 6–7|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century, when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question; various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan's supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rustici|first=  Craig M. |year= 2006 |title= The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England  |publisher= University of Michigan Press |page= 14|isbn= 9780472115440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Noble|first= Thomas F.

==Legend==
The earliest mention of a female pope appears in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Jean de Mailly]]'s chronicle of [[Metz]], ''Chronica Universalis Mettensis'', written in the early 13th century. In his telling, the female pope is not named, and the events are set in 1099. According to Jean:

{{quote|Query: Concerning a certain Pope or rather female Pope, who is not set down in the [[list of popes]] or Bishops of Rome, because she was a woman who disguised herself as a man and became, by her character and talents, a curial secretary, then a Cardinal and finally Pope. One day, while mounting a horse, she gave birth to a child. Immediately, by Roman justice she was bound by the feet to a horse's tail and dragged and stoned by the people for half a league, and, where she died, there she was buried, and at the place is written: "Petre, Pater Patrum, Papisse Prodito Partum" [Oh Peter, Father of Fathers, Betray the childbearing of the woman Pope]. At the same time, the four-day fast called the "fast of the female Pope" was first established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breverton|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Breverton|title=Breverton's Phantasmagoria: A Compendium of Monsters, Myths and Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2n5YdVTW0z8C&amp;pg=PT81|year=2011|publisher=Lyons Press|isbn=978-0762770236|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Jean de Mailly|Chronica Universalis Mettensis}}

Jean de Mailly's story was picked up by his fellow Dominican [[Stephen of Bourbon]], who adapted it for his work on the ''Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost''. However, the legend gained its greatest prominence when it appeared in the third ''recension'' (edited revision) of [[Martin of Opava]]'s ''Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum'' later in the 13th century. This version, which may have been by Martin himself, is the first to attach a name to the figure, indicating that she was known as "John Anglicus" or "John of Mainz." It also changes the date from the 11th to the 9th century, indicating that Joan reigned between [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] and [[Pope Benedict III|Benedict III]] in the 850s. According to the ''Chronicon'':

{{quote|John Anglicus, born at Mainz, was Pope for two years, seven months and four days, and died in Rome, after which there was a [[Sede vacante|vacancy in the Papacy]] of one month. It is claimed that this John was a woman, who as a girl had been led to Athens dressed in the clothes of a man by a certain lover of hers. There she became proficient in a diversity of branches of knowledge, until she had no equal, and, afterward in Rome, she taught the liberal arts and had great masters among her students and audience. A high opinion of her life and learning arose in the city; and she was chosen for Pope. While Pope, however, she became pregnant by her companion. Through ignorance of the exact time when the birth was expected, she was delivered of a child while in procession from [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] to the [[Lateran]], in a lane once named Via Sacra (the sacred way) but now known as the "shunned street" between the [[Colosseum]] and [[Basilica of San Clemente|St Clement's church]]. After her death, it is said she was buried in that same place. The Lord Pope always turns aside from the street, and it is believed by many that this is done because of abhorrence of the event. Nor is she placed on the list of the Holy Pontiffs, both because of her female sex and on account of the foulness of the matter.|Martin of Opava|Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum}}

One version of the ''Chronicon'' gives an alternative fate for the female pope. According to this, she did not die immediately after her exposure, but was confined and deposed, after which she did many years of penance. Her son from the affair eventually became [[Bishop of Ostia]], and ordered her entombment in his cathedral when she died.

Other references to the female pope are attributed to earlier writers, though none appears in manuscripts that predate the ''Chronicon''. The one most commonly cited is [[Anastasius Bibliothecarius]] (d. 886), a compiler of ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', who was a contemporary of the female Pope by the ''Chronicon'''s dating. However, the story is found in only one unreliable manuscript of Anastasius. This manuscript, in the [[Vatican Library]], bears the relevant passage inserted as a footnote at the bottom of a page. It is out of sequence, and in a different hand, one that dates from after the time of Martin of Opava. This "witness" to the female pope is likely to be based upon Martin's account, and not a possible source for it. The same is true of [[Marianus Scotus]]'s ''Chronicle of the Popes'', a text written in the 11th century. Some of its manuscripts contain a brief mention of a female pope named Johanna (the earliest source to attach to her the female form of the name), but all these manuscripts are later than Martin's work. Earlier manuscripts do not contain the legend.

Some versions of the legend suggest that subsequent popes were subjected to an examination whereby, having sat on a so-called ''sedia stercoraria'' or "dung chair" containing a hole, a cardinal had to reach up and establish that the new pope had [[testicle]]s, before announcing "''Duos habet et bene pendentes''" ("He has two, and they dangle nicely"),&lt;ref name="Clément1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clément|first=Catherine|title=Opera: The Undoing of Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dc4HeHS3ulMC&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1999|publisher=U of Minnesota P|isbn=978-0-8166-3526-9|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''habet''" ("he has them") for short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leroy|first=Fernand|title=Histoire de naître: de l'enfantement primitif à l'accouchement médicalisé|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aqgvIsStVsC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2001|publisher=De Boeck Supérieur|isbn=978-2-8041-3817-2|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were associated legends as well. In the 1290s, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Robert of Uzès]] recounted a vision in which he saw the seat "where, it is said, the pope is proved to be a man". Pope Joan has been associated with marvelous happenings. [[Petrarch]] (1304&amp;ndash;74) wrote in his ''Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani'' that after Pope Joan had been revealed as a woman:

{{quote|... in Brescia it rained blood for three days and nights. In France there appeared marvelous locusts, which had six wings and very powerful teeth. They flew miraculously through the air, and all drowned in the British Sea. The golden bodies were rejected by the waves of the sea and corrupted the air, so that a great many people died.|Petrarch|Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani}}

However, the attribution of this work to Petrarch may be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronica delle vite de pontefici et imperatori romani|url=http://www.franklin.library.upenn.edu/record.html?id=FRANKLIN_3544172|website=Franklin: Penn Libraries Catalog|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=24 January 2015|quote=The attribution to Petrarch is doubtful. 'Cette oeuvre est généralement considérée comme apocryphe.' – Bib. Nat. cat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
[[Image:La Papessa.jpg|thumb|upright|An untitled [[The High Priestess|popess]] on the ''Rosenwald Sheet'' of uncut [[Tarot]] woodcuts. Early 16th-century. Now in [[National Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] ]]
From the mid-13th century onward, the legend was widely disseminated and believed. Joan was used as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] preaching. [[Bartolomeo Platina]], the scholar who was prefect of the Vatican Library, wrote his ''Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX'' in 1479 at the behest of his patron, [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The book contains the following account of the female Pope:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pope John VIII: John, of English extraction, was born at Mentz ([[Mainz]]) and is said to have arrived at popedom by evil art; for disguising herself like a man, whereas she was a woman, she went when young with her paramour, a learned man, to Athens, and made such progress in learning under the professors there that, coming to Rome, she met with few that could equal, much less go beyond her, even in the knowledge of the scriptures; and by her learned and ingenious readings and disputations, she acquired so great respect and authority that upon the death of [[Pope Leo IV]] (as Martin says) by common consent she was chosen pope in his room. As she was going to the Lateran Church between the [[Colosseum|Colossean Theatre]] (so called from [[Nero]]'s Colossus) and St. Clement's her travail came upon her, and she died upon the place, having sat two years, one month, and four days, and was buried there without any pomp. This story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obscure authors, and therefore I have related it barely and in short, lest I should seem obstinate and pertinacious if I had admitted what is so generally talked. I had better mistake with the rest of the world, though it be certain, that what I have related may be thought not altogether incredible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Woodcut illustration of Pope Joan - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pope Joan giving birth. Woodcut from a German translation by Heinrich Steinhöwel of Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', printed by Johannes Zainer at Ulm ca. 1474 ([[British Museum]])]]
References to the female Pope abound in the later [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]]. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] wrote about her in ''[[De mulieribus claris|De Mulieribus Claris]]'' (1353).&lt;ref&gt;Ch. 99: "De Ioannae Anglica Papa;" it begins succinctly "Ioannes esto Vir nomine videbature, sexu tamen fœmina fuit."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicon'' of [[Adam of Usk]] (1404) gives her a name, Agnes, and furthermore mentions a statue in Rome that is said to be of her. This statue had never been mentioned by any earlier writer anywhere; presumably it was an actual statue that came to be taken to be of the female pope. A late-14th-century edition of the ''Mirabilia Urbis Romae'', a guidebook for pilgrims to Rome, tells readers that the female Pope's remains are buried at St. Peter's. It was around this time that a long series of busts of past Popes was made for the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo of Siena]], which included one of the female pope, named as "Johannes VIII, Foemina de Anglia" and included between Leo IV and Benedict III.

At his trial in 1415, [[Jan Hus]] argued that the Church does not necessarily need a pope, because, during the pontificate of "Pope Agnes" (as he also called her), it got on quite well. Hus's opponents at this trial insisted that his argument proved no such thing about the independence of the Church, but they did not dispute that there had been a female pope at all.

==During the Reformation==
In 1587, [[Florimond de Raemond]], a magistrate in the [[parlement]] de Bordeaux and an [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], published his first attempt to deconstruct the legend, ''Erreur Populaire de la Papesse Jeanne'' (also subsequently published under the title ''L'Anti-Papesse''). The tract applied humanist techniques of textual criticism to the Pope Joan legend, with the broader intent of supplying sound historical principles to ecclesiastical history, and the legend began to come apart, detail by detail. Raemond's ''Erreur Populaire'' went through successive editions, reaching a fifteenth as late as 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tinsley | first = Barbara Sher |date=Autumn 1987 | title = Pope Joan Polemic in Early Modern France: The Use and Disabuse of Myth | journal = Sixteenth Century Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–98 | issn = 0361-0160 | doi=10.2307/2540724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1601, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared the legend of the female pope to be untrue. The famous bust of her, inscribed ''Johannes VIII, Femina ex Anglia,'' which had been carved for the series of papal figures in the [[Siena Cathedral|Duomo di Siena]] about 1400 and was noted by travelers, was either destroyed or recarved and relabeled, replaced by a male figure, that of [[Pope Zachary]].&lt;ref name="ShePope"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stanford | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Stanford | title = The She-Pope: a quest for the truth behind the mystery of Pope Joan | year = 1999 | publisher = Arrow | isbn = 978-0-7493-2067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Pope Joan was "effectively demolished" by [[David Blondel]], a mid-17th century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] historian, who suggested that Pope Joan's tale may have originated in a satire against [[Pope John XI]], who died in his early 20s.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt; Blondel, through detailed analysis of the claims and suggested timings, argued that no such events could have happened.&lt;ref name="ODP"/&gt;

The 16th-century Italian historian [[Onofrio Panvinio]], commenting on one of [[Bartolomeo Platina]]'s works that refer to Pope Joan, theorized that the story of Pope Joan may have originated from tales of [[Pope John XII]]; John reportedly had many mistresses, including one called Joan, who was very influential in Rome during his pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 4|last= McClintock |first= John |author2=James Strong |year= 1882 |publisher= Harper|location= |isbn= |page= 980|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lX4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA980&amp;lpg=PA980#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  Biography: or, Third division of "The English encyclopedia"|last= Knight |first= Charles |year= 1867|publisher= Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co.|location= |isbn= |page= 633|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0MNPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT218&amp;lpg=RA1-PT218&amp;dq=pope+Joan&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Reformation]], various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writers took up the Pope Joan legend in their anti-Catholic writings, and the Catholics responded with their own polemic.  According to [[Pierre Gustave Brunet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/lapapessejeanne01brungoog|title=La Papesse Jeanne: Étude Historique et Littéraire|author=Pierre Gustave Brunet|editor=Gay|editor2=Doucé|location=Brussels|year=1880|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Various authors, in the 16th and 17th centuries, occupied themselves with Pope Joan, but it was from the point of view of the polemic engaged in between the partisans of Lutheran or Calvinist reform and the apologists of Catholicism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An English writer, Alexander Cooke, wrote a book entitled ''Pope Joane: A Dialogue between a Protestant and a Papist'', which purported to prove the existence of Pope Joan by reference to Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=Rustici&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuuJCOq0mSMC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Afterlife of Pope Joan: Deploying the Popess Legend in Early Modern England|last1=Rustici |first1=Craig M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=2006|page=43|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was republished in 1675 as ''A Present for a Papist: Or the Life and Death of Pope Joan, Plainly Proving Out of the Printed Copies, and Manscriptes of Popish Writers and Others, That a Woman called Joan, Was Really Pope of Rome, and Was There Deliver'd of a Bastard Son in the Open Street as She Went in Solemn Procession''.&lt;ref name=Rustici/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A present for a papist: or, The history of the life of pope Joan|date=1740|publisher=Olive Payne|location=Cornhill, London|pages=1–88|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJgHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an account of Pope Joan giving birth to a son in plain view of all those around, accompanied by a detailed engraving showing a rather surprised looking baby peeking out from under the Pope's robes. Even in the 19th century, authors such as Ewaldus Kist and [[Karl Hase]] discussed the story as a real occurrence. However, other Protestant writers, such as [[David Blondel]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], rejected the story.

==Modern analysis and critique==
[[File:Bonifacio Bembo.jpg|thumbnail|The [[The High Priestess|Popess tarot card]] from the [[Visconti-Sforza]] tarot deck, c. 1450]]

Most modern scholars dismiss Pope Joan as a medieval [[legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | title = The lady was a pope: A bestseller revives the outlandish tale of Joan | first = Lewis | last = Lord | date = 24 July 2000 | work = U.S. News Online | publisher = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5oQsXy9eD?url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/doubleissue/mysteries/pope.htm | archivedate = 23 March 2010 | accessdate = 2010-03-22 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Britain's preeminent historians dismisses the myth with a logical assessment of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius. Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy. 2011. ‘Pope Joan’ Chapter VI, pp. 63–70. {{ISBN|978-0-679-60499-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford Dictionary of Popes''&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelly | first = J.N.D. | title = Oxford Dictionary of Popes | year = 2005 | origyear = 1988 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=0-19-861433-0 | pages=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; declares that there is "no contemporary evidence for a female Pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign", but nonetheless acknowledges that Pope Joan's legend was widely believed for centuries, even by Catholics.

The 1910 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' elaborated on the historical timeline problem:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Between Leo IV and Benedict III, where Martinus Polonus places her, she cannot be inserted, because Leo IV died 17 July 855, and immediately after his death Benedict III was elected by the clergy and people of Rome; but, owing to the setting up of an [[Antipope]], in the person of the deposed Cardinal Anastasius, he was not consecrated until 29 September. Coins exist which bear both the image of Benedict III and of Emperor [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who died 28 September 855; therefore Benedict must have been recognized as pope before the last-mentioned date. On 7 October 855, Benedict III issued a charter for the Abbey of Corvey. [[Hincmar]], Archbishop of Reims, informed Nicholas I that a messenger whom he had sent to Leo IV learned on his way of the death of this Pope, and therefore handed his petition to Benedict III, who decided it (Hincmar, ep. xl in P.L., CXXXVI, 85). All these witnesses prove the correctness of the dates given in the lives of Leo IV and Benedict III, and there was no [[interregnum]] between these two Popes, so that at this place there is no room for the alleged Popess.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08407a.htm | title = Popess Joan | first = J.P. | last = Kirsch | year = 1910| work = The Catholic Encyclopedia | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | location = New York | accessdate = 2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has also been noted that enemies of the papacy in the 9th century make no mention of a female pope. For example, [[Photios I of Constantinople]], who became [[Patriarch]] in 858 and was deposed by [[Pope Nicholas I]] in 863, was an enemy of the pope. He vehemently asserted his own authority as patriarch over that of the pope in Rome, and would have made the most of any scandal of that time regarding the papacy; but he never mentions the story once in any of his voluminous writings. Indeed, at one point he mentions "Leo and Benedict, successively great priests of the Roman Church".&lt;ref name="pardoe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pardoe | first = Rosemary and Darroll | title = The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts behind the Legend | url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoanHome.html | accessdate = 2010-03-22 |date=August 1988 | publisher = Crucible | isbn = 978-1-85274-013-9 | chapter=Chapter 3: 'Did Joan exist?' | chapterurl = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoan3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemary and Darroll Pardoe, authors of ''The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan'', theorize that if a female pope did exist, a more plausible time frame is 1086 and 1108, when there were several antipopes; during this time the reign of the legitimate popes [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]], [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], and [[Pope Paschal II|Paschal II]] was not always established in [[Rome]], since the city was occupied by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and later sacked by the [[Normans]].&lt;ref name="pardoe"/&gt; This also agrees with the earliest known version of the legend, by [[Jean de Mailly]], as he places the story in the year 1099. De Mailly's "account" was acknowledged by his companion [[Stephen of Bourbon]].

[[Peter Stanford]], a British writer and former editor of ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', concluded in ''The Legend of Pope Joan: In Search of the Truth'' (2000) "Weighing all th[e] evidence, I am convinced that Pope Joan was an historical figure, though perhaps not all the details about her that have been passed on down the centuries are true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legend of Pope Joan|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8050-3910-8|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanford's work has been criticised as "credulous" by one mainstream historian.&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Popes", by Vincent DeMarco, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ ''Misconceptions about the Middle Ages''] ed. Stephen Harris, Bryon L. Grigsby; [[Routledge]], 18 Feb 2008, p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=oneTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=peter%20stanford%20pope%20joan&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 68]&lt;/ref&gt;
Against the lack of historical evidence to her existence, the question remains as to why the Pope Joan story has been popular and widely believed. [[Philip Jenkins]] in ''[[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]]'' suggests that the periodic revival of what he calls this "anti-papal legend" has more to do with [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] wishful thinking than historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Jenkins | title = The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = 17 April 2003 | page = 89 | isbn = 0-19-515480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sede stercoraria'', the throne with a hole in the seat, now at [[St. John Lateran]] (the formal residence of the popes and center of Catholicism), is to be considered. This and other toilet-like chairs were used in the consecration of [[Pope Pascal II]] in 1099.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one is still in the [[Vatican Museums]], another at the [[Musée du Louvre]]. The reason for the configuration of the chair is disputed. It has been speculated that they originally were Roman [[bidet]]s or imperial birthing stools, which because of their age and imperial links were used in ceremonies by Popes intent on highlighting their own imperial claims (as they did also with their [[Latin]] title, ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'').&lt;ref name="Norwich 2011 63"/&gt;

Alain Boureau quotes the humanist Jacopo d'Angelo de Scarparia, who visited Rome in 1406 for the enthronement of [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]]. The pope sat briefly on two "pierced chairs" at the Lateran: "... the vulgar tell the insane fable that he is touched to verify that he is indeed a man", a sign that this corollary of the Pope Joan legend was still current in the Roman street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boureau|first1=Alain|title=La Papesse Jeanne|date=1988|publisher=Aubier|location=Paris|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval popes, from the 13th century onward, did indeed avoid the direct route between the Lateran and St Peter's, as Martin of Opava claimed. However, there is no evidence that this practice dated back any earlier. The origin of the practice is uncertain, but it is quite likely that it was maintained because of widespread belief in the Joan legend, and it was thought genuinely to date back to that period.

Although some medieval writers referred to the female pope as "John VIII", a genuine [[Pope John VIII]] reigned between 872 and 882. Due to the Dark Ages' lack of records, confusion often reigns in the evaluation of events.

A problem sometimes connected to the Pope Joan legend is the fact that there is no [[Pope John XX]] in any list. It is said this reflects a renumbering of the popes to exclude Joan from history. Historians have known since [[Louis Duchesne]]'s critical edition of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' that the "renumbering" was actually due to a misunderstanding in the textual transmission of the official papal lists. In the course of the 11th century, in the time after [[Pope John XIX|John XIX]], the entry for [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] had been misread as referring to two different popes of this name. These two popes then came to be distinguished as ''Iohannes XIV'' and ''Iohannes XIV bis'' ("John XIV the second").

The existence of a second Pope John XIV was widely accepted in the 13th century, hence the numbering of Popes John XV through XIX was regarded as being erroneous. When Petrus Hispanus was elected pope in 1276 and chose the papal name John, he decided to correct this error by skipping the number XX. He numbered himself [[Pope John XXI|John XXI]], thus acknowledging the presumed existence of John XIV "bis" in the 10th century.

In 2018, an analysis of several silver coins from the 850s A.D, done by researchers from [[Flinders University]] indicated that they were inscribed with the name Johannes Anglicus. From the dating of the 850s, when there were missing papal records, led the researchers to believe the legend was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/female-pope-0010644|title= Researchers Find Physical Evidence for the Existence of a Female Pope|last= Whelan|first= Ed|date= 3 September 2018|website= www.ancient-origins.net|publisher= Ancient Origins|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.livescience.com/63598-female-pope-joan-medieval-coins.html|title= Legends of a Medieval Female Pope May Tell the Truth|last= Choi|first= Charles Q.|date= 16 September 2018|website= www.livescience.com|publisher= Purch|access-date= 24 October 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Pope Joan has remained a popular subject for fictional works. Plays include [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]]'s ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1813), a fragment by [[Bertolt Brecht]] (in ''Werke''. Bd. 10), and a [[monodrama]], ''Pausin Johanna'' by Cees van der Pluijm (1996).

The Greek author [[Emmanuel Rhoides]]' 1866 novel, ''The Papess Joanne'', was admired by [[Mark Twain]] and [[Alfred Jarry]] and freely translated by [[Lawrence Durrell]] as ''The Curious History of Pope Joan'' (1954). The American [[Donna Woolfolk Cross]]'s 1996 [[historical romance]], ''[[Pope Joan (novel)|Pope Joan]]'', was recently made into a German musical as well as the movie described below. Other novels include Wilhelm Smets's ''Das Mährchen von der Päpstin Johanna auf’s Neue erörtert'' (1829), [[Marjorie Bowen]]'s ''Black Magic'' (1909), Ludwig Gorm's ''Päpstin Johanna'' (1912),  Yves Bichet's ''La Papesse Jeanne'' (2005), and Hugo N. Gerstl's ''Scribe: The Story of the Only Female Pope'' (2005).

There have been two films based on the story of Pope Joan: ''[[Pope Joan (1972 film)|Pope Joan]]'' (1972), directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]], was titled ''The Devil's Imposter'' in the US. In 2009, it was recut to include more of [[John Briley]]'s original script and released as ''She... who would be Pope''. Also in 2009, another film with the title ''[[Pope Joan (2009 film)|Pope Joan]]'' was released, this one a German, British, Italian and Spanish production directed by [[Sönke Wortmann]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]], based on Cross's novel.

The play ''[[Top Girls]]'' by [[Caryl Churchill]] featured Pope Joan as a character, who was invited to a restaurant along with other historically important women in the past by a modern-day woman, Marlene, to discuss the restriction of [[feminism]] in the past.

Pope Joan is referenced in the video game ''[[Persona 5]]'', as the inspiration for Johanna, one of the titular personas (cognitive beings used by humans to battle demons) belonging to Makoto Niijima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Persona® 5|url=http://atlus.com/persona5/characters-makoto.html|website=atlus.com|publisher=ATLUS|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Riders of Judgment''''' is the fifth book chronologically in [[Frederick Manfred]]'s ''[[The Buckskin Man Tales]]'', which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes [[Wyoming]]'s [[Johnson County War]], based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's ''The War on Powder River'',&lt;ref name="HHS01" /&gt; which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel.

The novel was the source for the made-for-television film ''The Johnson County War,'' starring Tom Berenger. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler. Manfred changes the names of the county and the nearby towns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">'''Bruce Robert Isabell''' (June 2, 1952 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[Event planning|event planner]] who was behind lavish and innovative events including weddings and funerals of the richest and most famous. He helped make Christmas at the [[White House]] during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]] and helped create innovative events that made [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]] into the place to be in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Isabell was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he worked in a flower shop as a youth. After graduating from high school he moved to [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/nyregion/11isabell.html "Robert Isabell, Who Turned Events Into Wondrous Occasions, Dies at 57"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 2009. Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1970s and was hired by [[Ian Schrager]] at [[Studio 54]], after Schrager had seen the creative designs Isabell had developed while he was working for event planner Renny Reynolds who had done work at the club and was the leading planner in his day. Schrager described how Isabell "never tried to do too much, it was never design on steroids, yet there was always the razzle-dazzle".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He started on his own operating a floral shop within [[Bergdorf Goodman]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. He established "a full-service event-production house" in the city's [[West Village]] where he would oversee the creation of events around the world, in which the entire setting including flowers, lighting, sound and table decorations would be part of his craft. [[Anna Wintour]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine described him as "the king of the event world" who was "a magician"&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; and the first person that top hostesses would approach to create spectacular events. Isabell created roughly 30 events for writer and editor [[Tina Brown]]. She regarded him as "sort of a genius" who had the ability to "take any space and make magic in it".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For over a decade, he designed the annual [[Met Ball]] for ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=TCBG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/11894/|title=The Charity Ball Game|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=2005-05-21|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, he had four tons of [[glitter]] dumped on the floor of [[Studio 54]] for a New Year's Eve event, with club co-owner Ian Schrager describing how guests felt "like you were standing on stardust".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Bracketed between the 1986 wedding of [[Edwin Schlossberg]] to [[Caroline Kennedy]] and the 1996 nuptials of [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] and [[Carolyn Bessette]], he worked on the 1994 funeral of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For the July 1995 wedding of billionaire [[Robert Warren Miller]]'s daughter [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] to [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]] at [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia]] in [[Bayswater]], [[London]], Isabell created a virtual Greek temple in a tent, including pillars topped with roses, with a budget variously estimated at $5–8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Bob.

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the wedding of [[Alexandra von Fürstenberg]], Marie-Chantal's sister, to Prince Alexandre Egon von Fürstenberg, son of [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], Isabell transformed a tent in [[Battery Park]] into a Chinese teahouse complete with a throne room that included hanging lanterns and bamboo trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzy Menkes|Menkes, Suzy]].

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For Christmas 1998 at the Clinton White House, Isabell created a massive fir wreath with 1,500 lights individually colored a shade he called "Presidential blue".&lt;ref&gt;Bumiller, Elizabeth.

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A resident of [[Manhattan]]'s [[Greenwich Village]], Isabell was found dead on July 8, 2009, aged 57, in his townhouse at 16 Minetta Lane, where he had suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack). He is survived by his mother, two brothers and a sister.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

A '''social media newsroom''' is a company resource, set up to increase the functionality and usability of the traditional online newsroom. 

Social media newsrooms (SMNs) are intended to encourage dialogue and information sharing. Unlike online newsrooms, content is accessible to more than just journalists, but to all those with whom the company engages such as bloggers, their prospects, customers, business partners and investors. It gives these stakeholders access to news, public relations announcements, images, audio, video and other multimedia files.

In addition to posting press releases and corporate news, companies can integrate other social content from sites such as [[YouTube]], [[Flickr]] and [[Slideshow]] as well as streams from corporate [[Twitter]] accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 Communicate magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225210651/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 |date=2012-02-25 }} Hold the Front Page, Communicate magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional tools for journalists such as corporate fast facts, leadership information, a multimedia library, financial information, awards and other recent media coverage are also included in an SMN.

Examples of companies effectively using social media newsrooms include [[Opel Group]], Pressat, [[First Direct]], [[MyNewsdesk]], [[Scania AB|Scania]] and [[Newport Beach]].{{cn|date=March 2012}}

'''''The Sound of Music Live!''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by NBC on December 5, 2013. Produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], the special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. The television special starred [[country music|country]] singer and ''[[American Idol]]'' winner [[Carrie Underwood]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], and was performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].

Spearheaded by NBC chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]], the network positioned the special as being a live [[event television|television "event"]]. In preparing for the broadcast, Meron and Zadan emphasized the logistical challenges that they would face due to the live aspects of the special, and the fact that ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was an adaptation based on the musical itself and not the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]]. Meron felt that if the telecast were successful, the concept could become "another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." By her request, Underwood's casting as Maria was personally endorsed by [[Julie Andrews]], who starred in the 1965 film.

The production was met with mixed reviews; much of its criticism was directed towards the casting of Carrie Underwood to play Maria, whom critics (including the real-life [[von Trapp family]]) believed was not experienced enough in theatre to portray such an iconic role. While her vocal performance was praised, her acting was described by critics as "amateur", "lifeless" and lacking emotion. The production was a ratings success for NBC; with a total of 18.62 million live viewers, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' brought the network its highest Thursday night viewership for an entertainment program since the [[Goodnight, Seattle|series finale]] of ''[[Frasier (TV series)|Frasier]]'' in 2004, and prompted NBC to sign Zadan and Meron on to produce more live musicals for the network in the future.

==Plot==
Maria Rainer, a [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in [[Salzburg]], is contemplating the day she has spent in the mountains ("The Sound of Music").  When she returns to the Abbey, she learns from the Mother Abbess that she is to be the new governess for the von Trappe children.  Before she leaves the Abbey, Mother Abbess asks her to teach her the song that she's always singing ("My Favorite Things"). When Maria arrives at the von Trappe house, she is greeted coldly by the Captain and introduced to the children, who enter with military precision. Maria  finds that the Captain has emotionally closed himself off since the death of his wife and decides to teach his children the basics of singing to gain their trust and acceptance.

A month, later the captain returns home with Elsa Schraeder, whom he is courting, and their friend Max Detweiler, who is looking for the perfect local singing group to perform at the annual Kaltzberg Festival. When his children arrive dressed in clothes Maria had made from her old bedroom curtains he is outraged and embarrassed. Maria then confronts him and tells him how he does not know or understand his children and that they need him but this only upsets him more and he orders her to return to Nonnberg Abbey. However, upon hearing his children sing to Schraeder, his eyes are open to the truth Maria had been speaking and he embraces his children and ask Maria to stay on as governess.

He then throws a grand party for Schraeder and when the band plays the [[Ländler]], the captain's youngest son asks Maria to teach him the dance and the captain steps in to help. As the two dance an unspoken attraction begins to arise in the two and Maria puts a stop to the dancing. However, this unspoken attraction did not go unnoticed by Brigitta who confronts Maria on this. Though Maria strongly denies it she begins to realize that Brigitta is telling the truth. Then, Schraeder calls the children out to say good night to the guests and Max is instantly smitten with the idea to have the children sing in the festival and during all the hustle and bustle Maria sneaks off unnoticed and returns to the Abbey, where she confides in the Mother Abbess that she has fallen in love with the captain but that she is ready to take the orders of [[poverty, obedience and chastity]]. The Mother Abbess denies her this and encourages her to take face her problem head-on and to find the life she was born to live.

Maria then returns to the von Trapp home and is warmly greeted by the children, who no longer feel the joys of singing due to her sudden departure. When she finds out that the captain intends to marry Schraeder she decides to see her duties through until arrangements can be made for a new governess. However, the political differences between Schraeder and the captain cause the two to realize that they have no future together and she leaves. Meanwhile, the captain confronts Maria and the two admit their feelings for each other. The two agree to marry at the Abbey and while the two are on honeymoon, [[Anschluss|Germany invades Austria]].

When they return, the captain is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy and report immediately to [[Bremerhaven]]. Maria, thinking quickly, hands the Admiral the program for the Kaltzberg Festival showing that the von Trapp Family Singers are scheduled to perform, so the captain couldn’t possibly leave right away. They are granted permission to perform. During the finale, Max announces that a guard of honor is waiting to escort the captain away as soon as the concert is over. Maria leads the family in one more song to which they escape to one by one and flee to the Abbey. The Nazi soldiers search the Abbey for the von Trapps to no avail, as the family decides to flee Austria over the mountains with Maria's help.&lt;ref name="Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/the-sound-of-music-%E2%80%93-music-from-the-nbc-television-event-2013|title=The Sound of Music – Music from the NBC Television Event 2013|work=[[Masterworks Broadway]]|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and promotion==
On June 30, 2012, NBC's chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]] announced the network's plans to broadcast a live adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-NBC-Craig-ZadanNeil-Meron-to-Present-Live-Broadcast-of-THE-SOUND-OF-MUSIC-20120629#ixzz2CoUEezC5|title=NBC &amp; Craig Zadan/Neil Meron to Present Live Broadcast of THE SOUND OF MUSIC!|author=BWW News Desk|date=June 30, 2012|work=''broadwayworld.com''|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2012, the network announced that [[country music]] and [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', winner performer Carrie Underwood would star as Maria von Trapp in the production. In a statement, Greenblatt justified Underwood's involvement, saying that "[Maria] was an iconic woman who will now be played by an iconic artist."&lt;ref name=Bricker/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC musical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrie Underwood to Star as Maria von Trapp on TV's The Sound of Music|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20652388,00.html|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2013, NBC revealed the full cast of the special, and released a promotional image depicting Underwood as Maria von Trapp, wearing blond braids and a [[dirndl]], referencing one of [[Julie Andrews]]' "most iconic moments" from the [[The Sound of Music (film)|film adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strecker|first=Erin|title=NBC to re-air 'Sound of Music Live!' on Saturday|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date=December 10, 2013|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/10/sound-of-music-live-encore/|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eby&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/carrie-underwood-stars-maria-sound-music-live-poster-article-1.1458571|title=Carrie Underwood dons dirndl for NBC's 'The Sound of Music Live!' poster|first=Margaret|last=Eby|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=September 17, 2013|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being cast, Underwood personally asked Andrews for her endorsement of the role and the production, stating that "whenever I do a cover of somebody's song or whatever, I always get permission of the artist first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/134782/Carrie-Underwood-Reveals-Julie-Andrews-Gave-Sound-Of-Music-Live-TV-Special-Her-Seal-Of-Approval|title=Carrie Underwood Reveals Julie Andrews Gave 'Sound Of Music Live!'

Produced on a budget of around $9 million, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was broadcast live from a soundstage built at Grumman Studios in [[Bethpage, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/carrie-underwood-s-sound-of-music-special-to-air-live-from-bethpage-1.6528060|title=Carrie Underwood's 'Sound of Music' special to air live from Bethpage|last1=Amodio|first1=Joseph|date=December 2, 2013|website=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC, as well as producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], emphasized that the production was not a remake of the film, but an adaptation of the musical itself; Meron iterated that "the audience will discover, within the first few minutes of watching the show, that they are not seeing a TV version of the movie. They'll know right away it's ''The Sound of Music'', but it's a different ''Sound of Music'' than they are accustomed to seeing on film." Meron felt that if successful, the broadcast could "open the door to another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." He also praised the involvement of Underwood as the star of the production, believing that she was a quick learner, and "has all of the qualities of Maria." Greenblatt was highly supportive of the project, as he was, in the words of Zadan, a "passionate devotee of theater". Zadan considered the production to be "one of the profoundly complicated, amazing experiences we’ve ever had", noting the additional challenges created by the live broadcast.&lt;ref name=variety-smlcomplex&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live’: Producers Call It a ‘Profoundly Complicated, Amazing Experience’|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/sound-of-music-live-a-profoundly-complicated-amazing-experience-1200925997/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thq-somliveproduction&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC's 'Sound of Music' Producers on Live Show Fears and Big Expectations (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbcs-sound-music-producers-live-661941|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]| last=Ng|first=Philiana|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted by NBC as a "three-hour holiday event",&lt;ref name="Bricker"/&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was aired as part of a push by NBC to air more live entertainment specials. Among its most popular programs in recent years have been those with live components (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''); NBC's Jennifer Salke believed that the increased level of [[social networking service|social network]] interaction possible in a live broadcast, along with the feeling of being part of an "event", would encourage viewers to watch the special live instead of [[Video on-demand|on-demand]] or from a recording. NBC's previous attempt at event television, ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', was met with mixed reviews and viewership, but NBC did indicate that [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s advertising throughout the series brought a higher level of [[Brand awareness|awareness]] to the brand.&lt;ref name=adage-nbclive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Plots Aggressive Live Programming Strategy|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-plots-aggressive-live-programming-strategy/245473/|work=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|last=Poggi|first=Jeanine|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television special was also the first live musical special in almost fifty years on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Sound of Music: Music from the NBC Television Event|type=[[Compact disc]] [[liner notes]]|year=2013|publisher=[[Sony Masterworks|Masterworks]]|page=7|id=88843 79814 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC also produced five themed Walmart commercials to air throughout the special, featuring scenes of a family using products from the store set to songs from ''The Sound of Music''. The five ads were timed to air during the commercial break following the scene where the song was featured; NBC's advertising chief Dan Lovinger considered the ads to be a way to "enhance the excitement" of the presentation for families.&lt;ref name=variety-walmartads&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Ads for NBC’s "Sound of Music" Will Sound Just Like the Show|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/walmart-ads-for-nbcs-sound-of-music-will-sound-just-like-the-show-1200922060/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Prior to the broadcast, members of the real-life von Trapp family were critical of casting Underwood to play Maria, agreeing with the notion that she would be a good singer but a poor actor. They suggested that [[Anne Hathaway]], who played [[Fantine]] in the [[Les Misérables (2012 film)|2012 film adaptation]] of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], would have been a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Michael|title=Who the Von Trapps Wish Could Replace Carrie Underwood in ‘The Sound of Music Live’|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/who-the-von-trapps-wish-could-replace-carrie-underwood-in-the-sound-of-music-live/|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' received mixed reviews from entertainment critics, commending the show for its scope and supporting cast while questioning Underwood's acting capabilities.

Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote: "Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as alive as those damned hills, every time she was asked to stand on top of things and belt. But whether it was because of nerves or lack of experience, her acting was painfully lifeless and amateur throughout the first two thirds of the lengthy ordeal. The singer, it seems, is a proud graduate of the school of 'If I don't blink, they'll think I'm acting!'"&lt;ref name=db-somlreview&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live!’ Review: The Hills Are Barely Alive| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-review-the-hills-are-barely-alive.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'' liked Underwood's performance, commenting that not only could she sing, but "she is a luminous stage presence who had the guts to take on one of the most iconic roles of the stage or screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/columnists/verne-gay/sound-of-music-and-carrie-underwood-largely-a-success-1.6550556|title = 'Sound of Music' -- and Carrie Underwood -- largely a success|date = December 5, 2013|accessdate =December 6, 2013|work = [[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|last = Gay|first = Verne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the production "as lifeless as [its] alpine backdrops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV Review: '' 'The Sound of Music Live!'

He also panned Moyer, criticizing his vocal performance and describing "his attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness" as "mildly constipated" and "clenched." However, he lauded Benanti, Borle and McDonald's "strong" performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sound-music-live-tv-review-663346|title = The Sound of Music Live!: TV Review|date =December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last = Bernardin|first = Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its original airing, an encore presentation of ''The Sound of Music Live!'' aired on December 14, 2013, attracting 3.1 million viewers.

NBC's Bob Greenblatt considered the production to be a success, and signed Meron and Zadan to produce another live musical for the 2014 holiday season. Greenblatt felt that there were enough recognizable, family-friendly musicals to make events like ''The Sound of Music Live!'' an annual tradition, and he indicated that NBC received e-mails and phone calls from various theatrical rightsholders, expressing interest in having their musicals adapted in a similar fashion, In January 2014, NBC announced that it would broadcast a live version of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' in December 2014, and at NBC's [[upfronts]] in May 2014, Greenblatt announced that NBC had also obtained rights to produce an adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'', although the network did not announce any timeframe for the production.&lt;ref name=nyt-morelive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html?ref=television&amp;_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-nbcmusicman&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Announces 'Music Man' Live TV Production|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6084818/nbc-announces-music-man-live-tv-production|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=January 19, 2014 |title=NBC Announces ''Peter Pan'' for Next Live Production |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/19/nbc-announces-peter-pan-for-next-live-production/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that ''The Music Man'' project was put on hold for a live performance of ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/30/wiz-nbc The Wiz is NBC's next live musical] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved October 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the concept also spread to competing networks: in April 2014, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced that it would produce a [[Grease: Live|live production]] of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', which aired in January 2016.&lt;ref name=billboard-foxgrease&gt;{{cite web|title='Grease' Live Coming to Fox TV|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070137/grease-live-coming-to-fox-tv|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC aired ''[[Hairspray Live!]]'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

The special also had an influence on viewership for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s annual broadcast of the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]] of ''The Sound of Music''; with 6.5 million viewers and a 1.3 share, it was ABC's highest-rated airing of the film since 2007, although it was beaten by NBC's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref name=deadline-ratings/&gt;

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.

[[File:Analemma fishburn.tif|right|thumb|An [[analemma]] illustrates the changing [[position of the Sun]] over the course of a year, as viewed from a fixed [[standard time|time of day]].]]

A '''year''' is the [[orbital period]] of the [[Earth]] moving in [[Earth's orbit|its orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]]. The current year is {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

In [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.

A [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.

In astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.) Reprinted from: {{cite journal |first=George A. |last=Wilkins |url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf |title=The IAU Style Manual |year=1989 |journal=IAU Transactions |volume=XXB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''year'' is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the [[seasonal year]], the [[fiscal year]], the [[academic year]], etc. Similarly, ''year'' can mean the orbital period of any [[planet]]; for example, a [[Martian year]] and a [[Venus|Venusian year]] are examples of the time  a planet takes to    transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "year", entry 2.b.: "''transf.''  Applied to a very long period or cycle (in chronology or mythology, or vaguely in poetic use)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
English ''year'' (via [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] ''ġēar'' ({{IPA|/jɛar/}}), [[Anglian dialects|Anglian]] ''ġēr'') continues [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*jǣran'' (''*j[[Proto-Germanic language#ē₁ and ē₂|ē₁]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ran&lt;/nowiki&gt;'').
Cognates are [[German language|German]] ''Jahr'', [[Old High German]] ''jār'', [[Old Norse]] ''ár'' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''[[:wikt:𐌾𐌴𐍂|jer]]'',&lt;!--(Gothic ''e'' is always a long vowel)--&gt; from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] noun ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/yeh₁-|*yeh₁r-om]]}}'' "year, season". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''yārǝ'' "year", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὥρα}} (hṓra) "year, season, period of time" (whence "[[hour]]"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jarŭ'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' "of this year". &lt;!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁ey-]] "go", needs reference to deal with the "laryingealistic" problems--&gt;

Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''annī'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''annō'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h₂et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''aþn'' "year" (only the dative plural ''aþnam'' is attested).

Although most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh₁r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh₁-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh₁-ro-'' and ''*h₂et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning "to go, move", ''*h₁ey-'' and ''*h₂et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''éti'' "goes", ''atasi'' "thou goest, wanderest").
A number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means "each year", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means "in the year of the Lord".

The Greek word for "year", {{lang|grc|ἔτος}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' "old", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' "year", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' "year" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' "yearling (calf)", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' "bull calf",  English ''wether'' "ram" (Old English ''weðer'', Gothic ''wiþrus'' "lamb").

In some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in "summers", or "winters", or "harvests". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:年|年]] "year", originally [[:wikt:秂|秂]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting "harvest". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/godъ|godŭ]]'' "time period; year" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/lěto|lěto]]'' "summer; year".

In the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.

== Intercalation ==
No astronomical year has an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months, so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.

=== Julian calendar ===
In the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name "[[Leap Day]]" is applied to the added day.

The [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, 
has 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;).
In the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Miriam Nancy. (1924). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924PA.....32..407S "The New Calendar of the Eastern Churches], ''Popular Astronomy'', Vol. 32, p.407. Courtesy NASA Astrophysics Data System.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gregorian calendar===
The Gregorian calendar attempts to cause the [[northward equinox]] to fall on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the [[tropical year|northward equinox year]], or [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;Ziggelaar, A. (1983). [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=grc..&amp;year=1983&amp;volume=book&amp;page_ind=209 "The Papal Bull of 1582 Promulgating a Reform of the Calendar"]. In Coyne, Hoskin, Pedersen (eds), ''Gregorian Reform of the Calendar: Proceedings of the Vatican Conference to Commemorate its 400th Anniversary''. Vatican City: Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Specolo Vaticano, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years,   the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is {{gaps|365.242|5}} days; with a relative error below one [[Parts per million|ppm]] (8·10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;)  relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ({{gaps|365.242|19}} days) and even closer to the current ''March equinox year'' of {{gaps|365.242|374}} days that it aims to match.   It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.

===Other calendars===
{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}
Historically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.
Lunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).

A modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.

==Year numbering==
A [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.

The worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]] era (but the label [[Common Era]] is preferred by some). It was historically introduced in the 6th century and intended as counting years from the [[birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P. K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly state Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does state on page 585 the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes; the Gregorian calendar is used with the Anno Domini era.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] "in the year of the Lord"), or alternatively CE for "[[Common Era]]. Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].
Year numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no "year zero".
In the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], −1 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.

==Pragmatic divisions==
Financial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.

=== Fiscal year ===
A [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.

For example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.

=== Academic year ===
An academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].

Some schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.

Some other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.

There are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.

In India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Schools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.

== Astronomical years == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] --&gt;

=== Julian year ===
{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}
The Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit "year" (symbol "a" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many "real" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].

In the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.

:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]

The [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.

=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===
{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}

Each of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.

The [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service. (2010).[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html IERS EOP PC Useful constants.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean [[ecliptic longitude]] of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. G. (2013). Calendars. In S. E. Urban &amp; P. K. Seidelmann (Eds.), ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'' (3rd ed.). Mill Valley, CA: University Science Books. p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#longitude-ecliptic longitude, ecliptic]" and "[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#dynamical-equinox dynamical equinox]". (2018). In "Glossary", ''The Astronomical Almanac Online''. United States Naval Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt; the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.&lt;ref&gt;

The anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.  Its average duration is {{val|365.259636}} days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).&lt;ref&gt;

=== Draconic year ===
The draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same [[lunar node]] (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is
:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).

This term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Full moon cycle ===
The [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:
:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 34 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).

=== Lunar year ===
The [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].
A Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.

=== Vague year ===
The vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center&lt;/ref&gt;   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.

=== Heliacal year ===
A heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].

=== Sothic year ===
The [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.

=== Gaussian year ===
The [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:
:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).

=== Besselian year === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] --&gt;
The [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280°. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):&lt;ref&gt;

=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.
* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a "tropical year" measured from one passage of the northward ("vernal") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward ("autumnal") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.
* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.
* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].

An average Gregorian year is 365.2425 [[day]]s (52.1775 [[week]]s, {{val|8765.82}} [[hour]]s, {{val|525949.2}} [[minute]]s or {{val|31556952}} [[second]]s).  For this calendar, a common year is 365 days ({{val|8760}} hours, {{val|525600}} minutes or {{val|31536000}} seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ({{val|8784}} hours, {{val|527040}} minutes or {{val|31622400}} seconds).  The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has {{val|146097}} days and hence exactly {{val|20871}} weeks.

=== Equinoctial cycle ===
The Great Year, or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years.

=== Galactic year ===
The [[Galactic year]] is the time it takes Earth's [[solar system]] to revolve once around the [[galactic center]]. It comprises roughly 230 million Earth years.&lt;ref&gt;

== Seasonal year ==
{{Further|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
A seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a [[month]] from year to year.

== Symbols ==
In the [[ISO 80000-3|International System of Quantities]] the symbol for the year as a [[unit of time]] is ''[[a (year)|a]]'', taken from the Latin word ''annus''.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;

The joint document says that definitions such as the Julian year "bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth’s orbital movement", but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 AD (specified down to the millisecond), which suffers from the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norman E.

==== SI prefix multipliers ====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous]], from [[Template:Geologic time scale]] and from [[Theropoda]]. --&gt;
For the following, there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels, such as ''kilannus'', ''megannus'', etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.
* {{Anchor|Kiloannus|Kiloannum}} '''''ka''''' (for kiloannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[thousand]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E3 yr, also known as a [[millennium]] in [[anthropology]] and calendar uses. The prefix multiplier "ka" is typically used in geology, paleontology, and [[archaeology]] for the [[Holocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[period (geology)|periods]], where a non−[[radiocarbon dating]] technique: e.g. [[ice core]] dating, [[dendrochronology]], [[uranium-thorium dating]], or [[varve]] analysis; is used as the primary dating method for age determination. If age is primarily determined by [[radiocarbon dating]], then the age should be expressed in either radiocarbon or calendar (calibrated) years [[Before Present]].
* {{Anchor|Megaannus|Megaannum}} '''''Ma''''' (for megaannum) — a [[unit of time]] equal to one [[million]], or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, years, or 1 E6 yr. The suffix "Ma" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as geology, paleontology, and [[celestial mechanics]] to signify very long time periods into the past or future. For example, the [[dinosaur]] species ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was abundant approximately 66 Ma (66 million years) ago. The duration term "ago" may not always be indicated: if the quantity of a duration is specified while not explicitly mentioning a duration term, one can assume that "ago" is implied; the alternative unit "mya" does include "ago" explicitly. It also written as "million years" (ago) in works for general public use. In astronomical applications, the year used is the Julian year of precisely 365.25 days. In geology and paleontology, the year is not so precise and varies depending on the author.
* {{Anchor|Gigaannus|Gigaannum}} '''''Ga''''' (for gigaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years. "Ga" is commonly used in scientific disciplines such as [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] and geology to signify extremely long time periods in the past. For example, [[history of the earth|the formation of the Earth]] occurred approximately 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years) ago.
* {{Anchor|Teraannus|Teraannum}} '''''Ta''''' (for teraannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] years. "Ta" is an extremely long unit of time, about 70 times as long as the [[age of the universe]]. It is the same order of magnitude as the expected life span of a small [[red dwarf]].
* {{Anchor|Petaannus|Petaannum}} '''''Pa''''' (for petaannum) — a unit of time equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; years, or one [[10^15|quadrillion]] years. The half-life of the nuclide [[cadmium|cadmium-113]] is about 8 Pa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = P.

In [[astronomy]], geology, and paleontology, the abbreviation ''yr'' for ''years'' and ''ya'' for '''''years ago''''' are sometimes used, combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASC"&gt;

 |quote=(c) Convention and abbreviations. – The age of a stratigraphic unit or the time of a geologic event, as commonly determined by numerical dating or by reference to a calibrated time-scale, may be expressed in years before the present. The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with "a" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; years), Mega-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; years), and Giga-annus (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The "present" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as "ago" or "before the present" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English "[[:wikt:year|year]]", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. "22,000 years ago" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a [[Before Present]] ("BP") date.

Use of ''mya'' and ''bya'' is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being ''Ma'' and ''Ga'' for dates [[Before Present]], but "m.y." for the duration of epochs.&lt;ref name="AGUStyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strat" /&gt; This ''ad hoc'' distinction between "absolute" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geological Society of America|title=Time Units|url=http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|accessdate=February 17, 2010| archivedate=June 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616100504/http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that on graphs, using ''ya'' units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left, which may seem counter-intuitive. If the ''ya'' units are on the vertical axis, time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}
