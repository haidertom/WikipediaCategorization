{{Pakistan terrorist attacks}}
The '''2004 Quetta Ashura massacre''' is the [[sectarian]] [[terrorist attack]] on Tuesday 2 March 2004 during an [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] procession in southwestern city of [[Quetta]], in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]]. At least 42 persons were killed and more than 100 wounded in the attack.&lt;ref name="BBCnews11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3524851.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; Carnage in Pakistan Shia attack |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archivedate=28 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228103841/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3524851.stm |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack took place in Liaqat [[Bazaar]] Quetta, almost all of the victims were from [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic minority of Balochistan. The incident occurred just after the incident of [[Iraq Ashura bombings|Karbala Ashura bombings]] in [[Iraq]].

==Background==
The [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim|Muslim's]] processions are held throughout [[List of Muslim-majority countries|world]] to commemorate the [[Shahid|martyrdom]] of [[Hussein ibn Ali|Imam Hussain Ibn Ali]] every year on the [[Day of Ashura]].&lt;ref name="BBCnews11"/&gt; Like other parts of [[Pakistan]], [[Quetta]] city has a notable population of Shia Muslims who mainly belong to [[Hazara people|Hazara community]]. In Quetta, the Ashura procession starts from [[Mehr Abad|Alamdar Road]], where all the [[Hussainia|Imambargahs]] gather from around the city mainly from [[Hazara Town]], then the procession moves to Mezan Chowk, where [[Ibadah|prayers]] are offered, and [[Mourning of Muharram|Matam]] was performed then moves to Liaqat Bazaar and ends on Alamdar Road.

==Massacre==
The [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] procession was on its traditional route, when it reached the main [[Bazaar]], three terrorist from top a building, threw [[Grenade|hand grenades]] followed by firing with automatic weapons before they blew themselves up, which left around 50 dead and more 100 injured.&lt;ref name="BBCnews11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Terrorism, By: Leonard Weinberg. p 213.

===Perpetrators===
The police identified the assailants bodies after DNA tests and investigations. They belonged to [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi|Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ)]], the banned [[Pakistani]] [[terrorist group]]. The [[Balochistan Police|Police]] arrested a police constable who allegedly allowed the terrorist to use his house to plan the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-5-2004_pg7_10 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |newspaper=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |date=17 May 2004 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |archivedate=12 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212205311/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-5-2004_pg7_10 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}

Vol. I.|last=Tillich|first=Paul|date=1951-01-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S. Lewis|source=The Abolition of Man}}

[[I. K. Taimni]] says:
{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

'''Agni Yoga''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Агни Йога'') or the '''Living Ethics''' (Russian: ''Жива́я Этика''), or the '''Teaching of Life''' (Russian: ''Учение Жизни'') is a one of the [[Neo-Theosophy|neo-theosophical]] [[religious doctrine]] transmitted by the [[Helena Roerich]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]] from 1920. The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], the [[guru]] of Roerichs and [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the [[Theosophical Society]]. 

Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the [[yoga]] of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the [[planetary consciousness]] is a pressing necessity and that, through [[Individual#Buddhism|individual]] striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of all [[yoga]]s. In all the [[List of Hindu texts|ancient Hindu scriptures]], the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni-Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all the yogas, will extremely sate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of Yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire [[baptism]].

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and [[universalism]]. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the [[Universe]].

Agni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of [[Asian religions]] to [[Western world]]. Living Ethics has an international following and  has thousands of adherents. The ideas of Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on another [[esoteric]] movements and philosophies, among them the [[New Age]] and [[Transhumanism]].

===Etymology and concept===
The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced to the western public by the [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highest-yoga.info/en/yoga/agni-yoga.html |title=Agni Yoga |publisher=highest-yoga.info |accessdate=21 November 2018 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/746J1WitJ |archivedate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Agni]]'' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and Living Ethics ''God of Fire'', one marks immortality and the symbol of life. Agni is one of the supreme gods in the [[Rigveda]]. In Agni Yoga it is the Creative Fire of the Universe, the root of  the "Fire of Space"; and "psychic energy", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |author=[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]] |title=World Religions |publisher=New York: DK Publishing, Inc. |accessdate=10 September 2018 |year=1997 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wJMDtNzh?url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |archivedate=8 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin myth found in many [[Indo-European culture]]s Agni is a bird like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to [[Earth]]. In the early [[Vedic literature]], Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p15"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |title=Vedic Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |pages=15–16, 92–93 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yoga]]'' ({{lang-sa|योग}}; {{pronunciation|Yoga pronunciation.ogg |help=no}}) is one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. Yoga is a group of [[soul|spiritual]], [[mind|mental]], and [[Human body|physical]] practices or disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]]. The term ''Yoga'' has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma yoga|Karma Yoga]], [[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]] and [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]]. The term ''[[Rāja yoga]]'' originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is [[Samadhi]] ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|समाधि}}, {{IPA-hns|səˈmaːdʱi|hi}}), but was popularised by [[Swami Vivekananda]] as the common name for ''Ashtanga Yoga''. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, ''Samadhi'' is the eighth and final limb identified in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref name="Feuerstein2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Georg Feuerstein]] |title=The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cI5XDwAAQBAJ |date=23 October 2012 |publisher=Hohm Press |isbn=978-1-935387-39-8 |page=37 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yogadarsanabook3&gt;{{cite book |url=

As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space and with mystic speech.

''[[Karma]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}}) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in [[History of India|ancient India]]'s [[Vedic civilization]], the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]], particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |publisher=books.google.com |pages=5–7 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma works as one of the great principles of Cosmic Action. ''When man realizes the power of karma and strives to express the best aspirations, his path is parallel with the universal energy. The universal energy attracts the creative strivings. The future and the Infinite are thus being built'', written in the Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Infinity-II.php |title=Infinity Part II, 159 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1930 |accessdate=21 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73L93b1d9?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Infinity-II.php |archivedate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Spiritual evolution]]'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |GbWMw249xY8 |The Hidden History of Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of ''higher evolution'', a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the ''lower evolution'' or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
{{Main|Theosophy (Blavatskian)}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] was officially formed in [[New York City]] on 17 November 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]], and others. It was self-described as "an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity." After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]], in [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/The_Theosophical_Movement.html?id=OC4IAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |year=1951 |title=The Theosophical Movement 1875–1950 |publisher=Cunningham Press |location=Los Angeles |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Madame Blavatsky (''Upasica'' - this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the ''Teachers'' called [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|HPB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Theosophy and culture: Nicholas Roerich |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AdpG8sGt8K8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Stasulane, Anita |publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop |location=Rome |volume=8 |year=2005 |page=26-27 |isbn=978-88-7839-035-5 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the greatest [[occultist]] in the history of [[Western civilization]], insisted that [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is not a [[religion]], although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the "once universal religion" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement: '''There is no Religion higher than Truth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ultindia.org/tm_magazine/TMOct2018.pdf |title=The motto is located at the top of the magazine page |journal=The Theosophical Movement.

Theosophical organisations, regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the "essential truth" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in [[Theosophists]] who also identify as [[Christians]], [[Buddhists]], or [[Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books/about/Is_Theosophy_a_Religion.html?id=2Kd5ngEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;redir_esc=y |last=Blavatsky |first=Helena |year=2013 |title=Is Theosophy a Religion? |pages=24 |isbn=9781258977719 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Neo-Theosophy]] was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely theosophical by many theosophists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/ |title=Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy: Margaret Thomas' Study of C.

Other neo-theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]]. [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of the leading edge of the theosophical movement. Some examples of neo-theosophists today include [[Benjamin Creme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |author=[[Benjamin Creme]] |title=Transmission A meditation for the New Age |publisher=share-international.org |accessdate=5 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73hqv2NN3?url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Skumin]].

Russian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[History of Russia (1892–1917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]]. ''Slavophilia'' was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. There were also similar movements in [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed [[Slavophobia]], a fear of [[Slavic culture]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Slavophile  Russian history |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jPhqyh2?url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavophile |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable  philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]].In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[religion]], and [[Russian cosmism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Red-Cosmos-Tsiolkovskii-Grandfather-Centennial/dp/1603441174 |author=James T.

Vladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity ''Sophia'' in his works, such as ''Three Encounters'' and ''Lectures on Godmanhood''. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian [[Slavophiles]]' concept of [[sobornost]]. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolist]] art movements of his time. His teachings on ''Sophia'', conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew [[Shekinah]] or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a [[heresy]] by [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] and as unsound and unorthodox by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |title=The Sophian heresy and attempts to feminize God |publisher=ecumenizm.tripod.com |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jQWHmoo?url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] was a [[Russian Orthodox Christian]] philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of [[transhumanism]]. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of [[evolution]], as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the ''Common Cause''. Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving [[immortality]] and revival is the greatest goal of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1915_186.html |author=[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] |title=The religion of resuscitative resurrection The "Philosophy of the Common Task" of N.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the fiction writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[Herbert Wells]] as well as philosophical movements like [[Russian cosmism]]. In 1903, [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the [[Russian Empire]], but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of [[Interplanetary spaceflight]].&lt;ref name="Riper2007"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA26 |author=A.

He believed humans would eventually colonize the [[Milky Way]]. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |last=[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|Tsiolkovsky]] |first=Konstantin Eduardovich |title=The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces |place=[[Kaluga]] |publisher=The author's edition |year=1928 |pages=23 |language=Russian |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jR4GDrr?url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Russian philosophers and cossmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and [[Rerikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2013 |url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013 |title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

Information about [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]] spread in [[Western countries]] in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voises in religion were arguing over [[fundamentalism]] and [[modernism]] as the only available choice, and long before [[Shangri-La]] had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Taves |year=1985 |title=Philosophy Into Popular Fiction: Talbot Mundy and The Theosophical Society |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41171147?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |journal=Southern California QuarterlyTo |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=153-186 |doi=10.2307/41171147 |issn= |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qsRpCDp?url=http://scq.ucpress.edu/content/67/2/153 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended Masters]]. They are referred to by [[theosophist]]s as Elder Brothers of the human race, [[Adept]]s, [[Mahātmā]]s, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Blavatsky]], after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=TI6fAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+myth+of+the+Masters+revived&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY0bbboKTeAhWOhqYKHY0ABHMQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20myth%20of%20the%20Masters%20revived&amp;f=false |title=The myth of the Masters revived: The Occult Lives of Nikolai and Elena Roerich |publisher=books.google.ru |isbn=978-90-04-27043-5 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers.

When Nicholas Roerich passed away, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, “I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment”. The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |title=When Helena Roerich called Kalimpong home |author=Ajay Kamalakaran |publisher=Russia beyond |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtOgEyJ?url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Agni Yoga Society in the State of New York===
The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incor|porated in 1946 under the laws of the [[State of New York]], and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building ''[[Master Apartments]]''. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |title=AGNI YOGA (Sacred Heart Fire) AGNI YOGA The Great Synthesis |publisher=agniyoga.us |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtsQePo?url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike previous [[yoga]]s, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the [[common good]]. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a ''Living ethic''. 
Speaking about the role of [[personality]] in the [[spiritual evolution]] of mankind, [[Helena Roerich]] wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html |title=The Spiritual Work of the United Nations and the Liberation of Humanity Creating Fundamental Global Transformations through the Power of Thought |publisher=aquaac.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qu54znq?url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html  |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |title=Letters of Helena Roerich II, 25 October 1936 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=25 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6p2OJSzbs?url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |archivedate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvian Roerich Society in Riga===
The [[Latvia]]n Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerichs family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in [[London]], met  Nicholas and Helena Roerichs. In [[Riga]] they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and another theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to [[India]], to become the secretary of Roerich.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |title=In short about Latvian Roerich Society |publisher=latvijasrerihabiedriba |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73quP4eRE?url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by [[Doctor (title)|doctor]]-[[Homeopathy|homeopath]] [[:lv:Fēlikss Lūkins|Felix Lukin.]] [[Dr.]] Felix Lukin and his son Dr. [[:lv:Haralds Lūkins|Harald Lukin]] conducted [[clinical trials]] are many natural [[medication]]s that they received from [[Svetoslav Roerich]] of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB-0B1OWsbIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=Feliks+Lukin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9sr1G3-LjI&amp;sig=BOFxH1ypWEF0Mff4E_p4yCgnFWc&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikrLTm8JbeAhUFposKHVn1DlA4ChDoATAFegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Feliks%20Lukin&amp;f=false |title=History and status of homoeopathy around the world |author=Aswarda Das |publisher=books.google.com |isbn=81-8056-573-4 |year=2005 |pages=144-147 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 [[:lv:Rihards Rudzītis|Rihard Rudzitis]] officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, [[Helena Blavatsky]]’s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of [[Baltic states|Baltic]] Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed at the [[Soviet Union]] in 1988. Dr. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs [[Banner of Peace]]. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the [[USSR]] who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received a social beneficial status in the [[Republic of Latvia]].&lt;ref name="la"/&gt;

===Master Institute of United Arts in New York City===
Nicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture. His vision is nicely captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in [[New York City]] in 1921:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |title=Inspired By Art: Nicholas Roerich’s Symbolic Journey |publisher=philosophicalsociety.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qumopSR?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Art will unify all humanity. Art is one – indivisible. Art has its many branches, yet all are one.  Art is the manifestation of the coming synthesis. Art is for all''.}}

Mr. and Mrs. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the [[Master Apartments]], designed by Harvery Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6636038/ |title=Louis L. and Nettie S.

Roerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as [[George Bellows]], [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], [[Norman Bel Geddes]], [[Stark Young]], [[Deems Taylor]], [[Robert Edmond Jones]], and [[Lee Simonson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |title=Nicholas Roerich Biography America |publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qvhsopy?url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students according with the proposed curriculum. There were [[Felix Salmond]], [[Ernest Bloch]], and [[Michael Fokin]]. In the ''Institute of United Arts in New York City'' also taught [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Claude Bragdon]], [[George Bellows]], and [[Norman Bel Geddes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich-izvara.ru/eng/museum/roerich-and-america-13.htm

Some contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases. Roerich's name is universally known not only as Master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. The works of the Artist are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/tag/master-institute-of-united-arts/ |title=Tag Archives: Master Institute of United Arts |publisher=The Masonic Philosophical Society |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qwQmTGL?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/tag/master-institute-of-united-arts/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich's family moved to [[India]] in December 1923. They settled in [[Darjeeling]], a town in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is located in the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |title=Roerich Himalayan Museum Of Folk And Tribal Art |publisher=ignca.gov.in |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qx6ANWT?url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 to 1928, Roerichs took part in a [[Central Asia]] expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of [[India]], [[China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. [[Sikkim]] was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as [[history]], [[archeology]], [[ethnography]], [[history of philosophy]], [[arts]] and [[religions]], and [[geography]] was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from ''[[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett]]''. She also wrote a book named "Chalice of the East", which was published under the pen name "Iskander Khanum". Helena Roerich's manuscript "Foundations of Buddhism" was published in 1926, at [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.found-helenaroerich.ru/eng/biography/ |title=Helena I.

The plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati'' in [[Darjeeling]] in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to [[Naggar]] in [[Kulu Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/nagar-himachal-pradesh-india-interior-of-the-roerich-estate-museum-where-the-russian-artist-philosopher-and-traveller-nicholas-roerich-settled-i-image183921077.html |title=Nagar, Himachal Pradesh, India : Interior of the Roerich Estate museum, where the Russian artist, philosopher and traveller Nicholas Roerich settled |publisher=alamy.com |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qyyMq3k?url=https://www.alamy.com/nagar-himachal-pradesh-india-interior-of-the-roerich-estate-museum-where-the-russian-artist-philosopher-and-traveller-nicholas-roerich-settled-i-image183921077.html |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City===
[[File:WTM3 The Fixers 0015.jpg |180px |thumb |right |[[Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City]]]]
{{Main|Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City}}

The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)]], which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This Museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920's. The brownstone is chock-full of amazing natural scenes from the Himalayas, where this artist spent  two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with blazing orange skies or impossibly deep blue mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/travel/journeys-specialty-museums-finding-art-not-crowds-in-new-york.html |date=16 April 2006 |author=Seth Kugel |title=JOURNEYS: SPECIALTY MUSEUMS; Finding Art, Not Crowds, in New York.

Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich’s accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5Kyo03NxncC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22Nicholas+Roerich+Museum%22&amp;ei=CfWySJWGBIyuyAT-uKz-Bg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1VaGGP0xsNuixcSHcUcdMEJCcA3g |title=Spiritual Places| last=Squires| first=Emily| authorlink=Emily Squires |author2=Len Belzer |year=2000| pages=86 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |isbn=1931044031 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness. Information about these Roerich's ideas is always available. The museum also provides an opportunity for young musicians to perform in front of an audience on a voluntary and free basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php?mid=about_en |title=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |publisher=roerich.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j1nfmzWO?url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php |archivedate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and [[Cosmos]], contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |title=The Nicholas Roerich Museum |accessdate=17 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pms1o0eG?url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |publisher=en.icr.su |archivedate=17 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The World Organisation of Culture of Health===

''The World Organisation of Culture of Health ('''WOCH''')'' — International [[Social movement organization|social movement]] ''To Health via Culture'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. [[Victor Skumin]] was elected to the post of the President-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the registered in [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation]] Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |title=Charter of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (Russian: Устав) |publisher=Kult-zdor.ru |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6poMifaLN?url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |archivedate=18 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book ''Supermundane'' (paragraph 525) recorded the words of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master Morya]], addressed to Urusvati,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |title=Supermundane, 525 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ATQDcyS?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Urusvati knows that people are responsible for three aspects of health. First, their own health; second, the health of the planet; and finally, the health of the Supermundane World... People must safeguard their own health, not only for themselves but also for those around them. The human organism, though seemingly small, is a powerful repository of energy, and truly dominates its earthly environment''.}}

It is from these positions that WOCH approaches the solution of problems related to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=5 |author=Victor A. Skumin |title=Culture of health is a science of future |publisher=The World Organisation of Culture of Health |accessdate=10 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wFXbtCDp |archivedate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga'' says, physicians can be true helpers of humanity in the ascent of the spirit. The intellect of a physician must be reinforced by his heart. The physician must be a psychologist, and he must not ignore the wondrous psychic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Aum.php |title=Aum, §3 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1936 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ASzqsWl |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Verhorubova and Prof. Lobanova from [[Tomsk State Pedagogical University]] argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by [[Victor Skumin|Skumin]], the culture  – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii |last2=Lobanova |first2=N.A. |last1= Verhorubova |first1=O.V. |title= Многообразие определений феномена "культура здоровья" как показатель его многогранности в педагогическом образовании |trans-title=The diversity of definitions the phenomenon of "culture of health" as an indicator of its versatility in education |journal=Вестник Томского государственного педагогического университета |year=2012 |issue=5 |pages=161–5 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cKKxNxWb |archivedate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/ibmcnepal/videos/vb.242290825944809/670365706470650/?type=2&amp;theater] |title=International Buddhist Meditation Centre |publisher=facebook.com |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anthem]] of WOCH (''To Health via Culture'') consists of four [[stanzas]]. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word [[Agni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=Victor |script-title=ru: Молитвы, гимны, притчи Культуры Здоровья |trans-title=Culture of Health: prayers, hymns, parables |year=2002 |location=[[Cheboksary]] |publisher=To Health via Culture |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m.html |language=Russian |isbn=5-88167-018-3 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmcES03C?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m.html |archivedate=17 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gimns of Culture of Health"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=Victor |script-title=ru: Гимны Культуры Здоровья |trans-title=Gimns of Culture of Health |year=2007 |location=[[Cheboksary]] |publisher=To Health via Culture |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/gimn.html |language=Russian |isbn=978-5-88167-030-6 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmcoqT4R?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/gimn.html |archivedate=17 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{YouTube|kyknqmZhyIk|''Anthem "To Health via Culture."''}}). Another anthem by [[Victor Skumin#Literary and publishing activities|Skumin]] is termed "Urusvati". [[Helena Roerich]], known as the ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] Urusvati'' in Agni Yoga and [[Rerikhism]]. This anthem begins with the phrase, "The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace".

This is a conversation about the [[Eternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php |title=The Museum Collection |publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum NY |accessdate=29 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j1nfmzWO?url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php |archivedate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anaisa Pye''' (alternatively, '''Anaisa Pie''', '''Anaisa Pie Danto''', or '''Anaisa La Chiquita''') is a very popular [[loa]] within [[Religion in the Dominican Republic#Afro-Caribbean religions|Dominican Vodou]].  She is considered the [[patron saint]] of love, money, and general happiness within the [[Religion in the Dominican Republic#Afro-Caribbean religions|21 Divisions]].  She is often considered extremely flirtatious, generous, and playful by her devotees.  She, as well as other worshipers, are concerned for other female Loas, as they consider themselves able to provide for anything a person could request.  In [[Roman Catholicism]], she is [[Syncretism#Religious_syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Saint Anne]] and her altars are often decorated with pictures and statues of Saint Anne and [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|the child Mary]].   She is said to work very well with [[Belie Belcan]], another popular Loa who is associated with [[St. Michael: Roman Catholic traditions and views|Saint Michael the Archangel]].  Therefore, one will always find icons of Saint Anne next to icons of Saint Michael in Vodou households and temples.  Her [[feast day]] is celebrated on 26 July and her favorite colors are yellow and pink.  Some people consider [[Our Lady of Charity|Cachita]] to be one of her "puntos" (or incarnations).

'''Belief''' is the state of [[mind]] in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being [[empirical evidence]] to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a [[mental representation]] of an [[Intentionality|attitude positively oriented]] towards the [[likelihood]] of something being [[truth|true]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Primmer |first= Justin |editor-last= Primmer |editor-first= Justin |contribution= Belief |title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab |location= Stanford, CA |year= 2018|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek thought]], two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: ''[[Pistis#Pistis in rhetoric|pistis]]'' and ''[[doxa]]''. Simplified, we may say that ''pistis'' refers to "trust" and "confidence", while ''doxa'' refers to "opinion" and "acceptance".  The English word "[[orthodoxy]]" derives from ''doxa''.  Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Primmer|first1= Justin|title= The nature and purpose of belief|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|date= 2018|volume= 29|issue= 3|pages= 219–239|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/LEITNA|accessdate= 3 June 2018 | quote = The purpose of belief is to guide action, not to indicate truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to personal attitudes
associated with [[truth value|true or false]] ideas and concepts. However, "belief" does not require active [[introspection]] and circumspection. For example, we never ponder whether or not the sun will rise. We simply assume the sun will rise. Since "belief" is an important aspect of mundane life, according to Eric Schwitzgebel in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', a related question asks: "how a physical organism can have beliefs?"&lt;ref&gt;

==Knowledge and epistemology==
[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries – [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as "[[justified true belief]]". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa – common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orthé), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm – Copyright (c) 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato has been credited for the "''justified true belief''" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gettier |first=E. L. |year=1963 |title=Is justified true belief knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–123 |doi= 10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]] (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=A. I. |year=1967 |title=A causal theory of knowing |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=357–372 |doi= 10.2307/2024268|jstor=2024268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the "justified true belief" definition, and challenged the "sophists" of their time.

==As a psychological phenomenon==
Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and ''[[dispositional belief]]s'' (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P. W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H. D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-853010-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.

Philosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her controversial book ''Saving Belief'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |location= |isbn=0-691-07320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct - Sometimes called the "mental sentence theory," in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] is one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says "I believe that snow is white" and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Most notably, philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science hasn't provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both [[eliminativism|eliminativists]] in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they don't go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
(1) Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.
(2) Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
(3) Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3–13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological belief compared to religious belief==
Historically ''belief-in'' belonged in the realm of religious thought, ''belief-that'' instead belonged to epistemological considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = H. H. | year = 1965 | title = Belief 'In' and Belief 'That' | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2400996 | journal = Religious Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 01| pages = 5–27 | doi = 10.1017/S0034412500002304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief-in===
To "believe in" someone or something is a distinct concept from "believing-that." There are at least these types of belief-in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacIntosh |first=J. J. |year=1994 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-15948893/belief-revisited-reply-williams.html |title=Belief-in Revisited: A Reply to Williams |journal=Religious Studies |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=487–503 |doi=10.1017/S0034412500023131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commendatory''' / '''[[Faith]]''' - we may make an expression of 'faith' in respect of some performance by an agent X, when without prejudice to the truth value of the factual outcome or even confidence in X otherwise, we expect that specific performance. In particular [[self-confidence]] or faith in one's self is this kind of belief.
* '''Existential claim''' – to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenomenon in a general way with the implied need to justify its claim to existence. It is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. "He believes in witches and ghosts" or "many children believe in Santa Claus" or "I believe in a deity" are typical examples.&lt;ref name="belief-in"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macintosh |first=Jack |chapter=Belief-in |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] |page=86 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic form is distinct from the assertion of the truth of a proposition since verification is either considered impossible/irrelevant or a [[counterfactual]] situation is assumed.

===Belief-that===
====Economical belief====
Economic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Taylor-Gooby – [https://www.issa.int/html/pdf/jeru98/theme3/3-1a.pdf ECONOMIC BELIEFS AND SOCIAL POLICY BEHAVIOUR] [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (Economic Beliefs and behaviour research programme) [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from  existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Arena"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWtuUnc1u4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMI1N-8qfSbxwIVzLUUCh0tuwX3&amp;q=economic%20beliefs|author=R. Arena &amp; A.

====Delusion====
Insofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential  and propositional form we are using the sense of ''belief-that'' rather than ''belief-in''. [[Delusion]] arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.&lt;ref name="L. Bortolotti"&gt;{{cite book |author=L. Bortolotti|title=Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs|publisher=OUP Oxford 2010, 299 pages, ''International Perspectives in Philosophy &amp; Psychiatry'' |ISBN=0199206163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/ ''Tarski's Truth Definitions''], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ ''LOTH''] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" Alfred Tarski Dover 1995/41, Ch. I, &amp;sect; 2 ''Expressions containing variables—sentential and designatory functions'' and Ch. II ''On the Sentential Calculus'' in its entirety&lt;/ref&gt;

Delusions are defined as beliefs in [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria&lt;ref&gt;[http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2013/06/delusions-in-dsm-5.html ''Delusions in the DSM 5''] A blog by Lisa Bortolotti &amp; Ema Sullivan-Bissett&lt;/ref&gt; (for example in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''). Psychiatrist and historian [[G.E. Berrios]] has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts," where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.

In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] says, "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to [[Credo quia absurdum|entertain beliefs contrary to fact]].

==Formation==
[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:

===The conditional inference process===
When people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate a) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and b) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false (respectively). Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"&gt;Wyer, R. S., &amp; Albarracin, D. (2005). Belief formation, organization, and change: Cognitive and motivational influences. In D. Albarracin, B. T. Johnson, &amp; M. P. Zanna, The Handbook of Attitudes (273–322). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models of belief formation===
Unlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

===Information processing models of belief formation and change===
These models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

Some influences on people's belief formation include:
* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape our beliefs in different domains. [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Andrew Gelman |first=Andrew |last=Gelman |first2=David |last2=Park |first3=Boris |last3=Shor |first4=Joseph |last4=Bafumi |first5=Jeronimo |last5=Cortina |title=Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals believe the [[religion]] they were taught in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Argyle |title=The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-12330-5 |page=25 |quote=Religion, in most cultures, is ascribed, not chosen. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charismatic leaders can form and/or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hoffer |title=The True Believer |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2002 |isbn=0-06-050591-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is belief voluntary? Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using [[cognitive dissonance]].
* [[Advertising]] can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, and association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Kilbourne |first2=Mary |last2=Pipher |title=Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-684-86600-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the [[sleeper effect]], instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement's ability to persuade viewer's beliefs if a discounting cue is present.&lt;ref&gt;see Kumkale &amp; Albarracin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Babette |last=Rothschild |title=The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-393-70327-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, Leadership Therapy, she states "You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you." This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Anna |title=Leadership Therapy: Inside the Mind of Microsoft |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=69 |isbn=1-4039-8403-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justified true belief&lt;!--'Justified true belief' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Justified true belief'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a definition of [[knowledge]] that gained approval during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], 'justified' standing in contrast to 'revealed'. There have been attempts to trace it back to [[Plato]] and his dialogues.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;The received view holds it that Plato's theory presents knowledge as remembering eternal truths and justification reawakens memory, see {{cite book |last=Fine |first=G. |chapter=Introduction |title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-924558-4 |pages=5–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; believes that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, and
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is justified in believing that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of [[Gettier problem]]s, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chisholm | first = Roderick | title = The Foundations of Knowing | chapter=Knowledge as Justified True Belief |publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8166-1103-3 |authorlink=Roderick Chisholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Nozick]] suggested{{Year needed|date=April 2017}} a [[Gettier problems#Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking|clarification]] of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that "no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernecker |first=Sven|last2= Dretske|first2= Fred|date= 2000|title= Knowledge. Readings in contemporary epistemology|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|isbn= 978-0198752615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the Justified True Belief account is the "standard, widely accepted" definition of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter2, p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
{{see also|Belief revision}}
An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.
Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision.  One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity.  However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]].   Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as  [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.
Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes.  Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence.  This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification.  Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

==Partial==
Without qualification, "belief" normally implies a lack of [[doubt]], especially insofar as it is a designation of a [[life stance]]. In practical everyday use however, belief is normally partial and retractable with varying degrees of certainty.

A copious literature exists in multiple disciplines to accommodate this reality. In mathematics [[probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[fuzzy set theory]], and other topics are largely directed to this.

==Prediction==
Different psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100–120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., "It will rain tomorrow"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by "and" or "or" do not follow the model as well.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg" /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Religion collage updated.jpg|thumb]]
Religious belief refers to attitudes towards [[mythological]], [[supernatural]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of a [[religion]].{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Religious belief is distinct from [[religious ritual|religious practice]] and from [[religious behaviour]]s – with some believers not practicing [[religion]] and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a [[deity]] or deities, to the idea of [[Miracle|divine intervention]] in the [[universe]] and in [[human life (disambiguation)|human life]], or to the [[deontological]]  explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a [[spiritual leader]] or of a [[spiritual group]]. In contrast to other [[belief system]]s, religious beliefs are usually [[Codification (law)|codified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief | publisher = University of California Press | author = Wittgenstein, Ludwig | year = 2007 | pages = 53 | isbn = 0520251814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of religious belief===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or [[creed]]s, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by [[religious authority|religious authorities]] do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An empiricist's view of the nature of religious belief | publisher = Norwood Editions  (Norwood, Pa.) | author = Braithwaite, R. B. | year = 1975 | isbn = 088305955X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Religious fundamentalism}}
First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist [[Protestants]] in the United States of America,&lt;ref name="A.C. Dixon"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2012-11-27 |url = http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |title = 'The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth' |accessdate = 2012-11-28 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203144842/http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |archivedate = 3 December 2012 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "fundamentalism" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Religious fundamentalism has been identified{{by whom|date=November 2017}} in the media as being associated with [[fanaticism|fanatical]] or [[zealotry|zealous]] political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====Orthodoxy====
{{Main|Orthodoxy (disambiguation)}}
First used in the context of [[Early Christianity]], the term "orthodoxy" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, [[apologetics|apologies]], and [[hermeneutics]] of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term "[[Magisterium]]". The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism – now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of "orthodox" is "[[heterodox]]", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].

====Modernism/reform====
The [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophe]]s'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.

====Superstition====
{{Main|Superstition}}
A term signifying derogation that is used by the religious and non-religious alike, "superstition" refers to a  deprecated belief in supernatural causation. Those who deny the existence of the supernatural generally attribute all beliefs associated with it to be superstitious, while a typical religious critique of superstition holds that it either encompasses beliefs in non-existent supernatural activity or that the supernatural activity is inappropriately feared or held in improper regard (see [[idolatry]]). Christian Churches strongly condemned [[occultism]], [[animism]], [[paganism]], and other [[folk religion]]s as mean forms of superstition, though such condemnation did not necessarily eliminate the beliefs among the common people, and many such religious beliefs persist {{as of | 2018 | lc = on | alt = today}}.

====Systemization====
In Buddhism, practice and progress along the [[spiritual path]] happens when one follows the system of [[Buddhist practice]]. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system includes bad aspects too.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a "bad" religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha:
{{quote|"O Gotama, there are [[Shramana|Samana]]s (wandering monks) and [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and [[Mahavira|Nigantha Nataputta]]. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"}}

The Buddha replied:
{{quote|"Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], neither in it is there found a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|first stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Once-returner|second stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|third stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Arahant|fourth stage]]."}}

As a religious tradition, [[Hindu]]ism has experienced many attempts at systemization. In medieval times, [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] advocated for the [[Advaita]] system of philosophy. In recent times, [[Tamala Krishna Gosvami]] has researched the systemization of [[Krishna]] theology as expounded by [[Srila Prabhupada]]. (See [[Krishnology]])

====Universalism====
Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern [[Western culture|Western]] cultures do.

Some [[anthropologist]]s{{Who|date=July 2010}} report cultures in which gods are involved in every aspect of [[human condition|life]] – if a cow goes dry, a god has caused this, and must be propitiated; when the sun rises in the morning, a god has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.

People with such a [[worldview]] often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} regard the influence of [[Western culture]] as inimical. Others with this worldview resist the influence of [[science]], and believe that science (or "so-called science") should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief, written into the constitutions of many{{which|date=November 2017}} [[Islam]]ic nations,  is shared by some [[fundamentalist Christians]].

In addition, beliefs about the [[supernatural]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as [[nature]] and non-nature, nor between science and what most educated people believe. In the view of some historians{{Who|date =September 2013}}, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] [[Athenian]]s saw [[science]], political [[tradition]], [[culture]] and religion as not easily distinguishable, but as all part of the same body of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] available to a [[community]].

===Approaches to the beliefs of others===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.  All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

====Exclusivism====
{{See also|Exclusivism}}
People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founder]]s or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the "correct" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Inclusivism====
People with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.

Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.

====Pluralism====
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}
People with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.  Examples include:

* Extracts from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji (Sikh Holy Scriptures), "There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all" (Pannaa 45). "By His Power the [[Vedas]] and the [[Purana]]s exist, and the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions. By His Power all deliberations exist." (Pannaa 464). "Some call Him, '[[Lord Rama|Ram]], Ram', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1|| He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us amen." (Pannaa 885).

====Syncretism====
{{Main|Syncretism}}
People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretistic faith.

===Adherence===
{{See also|Existence of God}}
Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:

* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Compare: {{cite web | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | publisher = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many{{quantify|date= November 2017}} people regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher =  SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organized religions promote a sense of [[Community (disambiguation)|community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].&lt;ref name="repa"&gt;{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J. Theodore | date = 1998-10-18 | url = http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | title = Building Community: The Marriage of Religion and Education | accessdate = 2006-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907172411/http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | archive-date = 7 September 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Note for example the concept of a [[cultural Christian]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with [[spiritual power]]. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom.  It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice.  Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), "[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful."&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S. Larson |author3 = Harold G. Koenig  |date = October 2000 | title = Research Findings on Religious Commitment and Mental Health | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p001078.html | accessdate= 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, "a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation," an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |authorlink1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostasy===
{{Main|Apostasy}}
{{See also|Existence of God#Arguments against belief in God}}
Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |authorlink = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927-03-06 |url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and empases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christian]]s share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few
** the slaughter of the [[Huguenot]]s by French [[Catholics]] in the sixteenth century
** [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s killing each other when [[Pakistan]] separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of [[Shiite]] Muslims by [[Sunni]] Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of [[Protestant]]s by [[Catholics]] and vice versa in [[Ireland]] (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that continues {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}. - According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Philip (pseudonym of Jeremy Bentham) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=qiRQAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Natural+Religion+on+the+Temporal+Happiness+of+Mankind&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sGJSbzT4Ts&amp;sig=pzV-WU5Jx0cpsVXX08ZU17mL-BE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 ''Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind''], 1822, R. Carlile, London, at page 76: "Of all human antipathies, that which the believer in a God bears to the unbeliever is the fullest, the most unqualified, and the most universal"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.
* The maintenance of [[Human life (disambiguation)|life]] and the achievement of [[self-esteem]] require of a person the fullest exercise of reason{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}—but morality (people are taught{{by whom|date=November 2017}}) rests on and requires faith.&lt;ref&gt;Faith is the commitment of one's consciousness to beliefs for which one has no sensory evidence or rational proof. When a person rejects reason as their standard of judgment, only one alternative standard allegedly remains to them: feelings. A mystic is a person who treats feelings as tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with knowledge. To practice the "virtue" of faith, one must (we are told) be willing to suspend one's sight and one's judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, with that which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one's knowledge, and to induce a trance like illusion of understanding. One must allegedly be willing to repress one's critical faculty and hold it as one's guilt; one must be willing to drown any questions that rise in protest—to strangle any trust of [[reason]] convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the protector of one's life and cognitive integrity. The presumed human need for self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control over reality—but no control is possible in a universe which, by one's own concession, contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a universe in which one is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one must deal, not with the unknown, but with the unknowable; no control is possible if a person proposes, but a ghost disposes; no control is possible if the universe is a haunted house. A person's life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of his or her consciousness be reality and this earth—but morality, people are taught, consists of scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, and of contemplating, instead, a "different" and "higher" reality, a realm inaccessible to reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by revelation, by special dialectical processes, by that superior state of intellectual lucidity known to Zen-Buddhists as "No-Mind," or by death. A person's life and self-esteem require that this person take pride in their power to think, pride in their power to live—but morality, people are taught, holds pride, and specifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, people are taught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the smallness, the impotence of one's mind. A person's life and self-esteem purportedly require the person to be loyal to their values, loyal to their mind and its judgments, loyal to their life—but the essence of morality, people are taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one's mind to some higher authority, and the sacrifice of one's values to whoever may claim to require it. A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher value in favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which one does not value in order to obtain that which one does value—or if one gives up a lesser value in order to  obtain a greater one—this is not a sacrifice, but a gain. Remember further that all of a person's values allegedly exist in a hierarchy; people value some things more than others; and, to the extent that a person is rational, the hierarchical order of the person's values is rational: that is, the person values things in proportion to their importance in serving this person's life and well-being. That which is inimical to their life and well-being, that which is inimical to their nature and needs as a living being, the person disvalues. Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted value structure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objective merit, in relation to the person's nature and needs; they frequently value the very things that will lead them to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, they are engaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice. But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational person who must be “cured”. They must learn to do violence to their own rational judgment—to reverse the order of their value hierarchy—to surrender that which their mind has chosen as the good—to turn against and invalidate their own consciousness.{{cite book

==Systems==
A '''belief system''' is a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be classified as [[Religious belief|religious]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[politics|political]], [[Ideology|ideological]], or a combination of these. Philosopher [[Jonathan Glover]] says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth A. Minton, Lynn R. Khale|title=Belief Systems, Religion, and Behavioral Economics|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=Business Expert Press LLC|isbn=978-1-60649-704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert, sociological perspectives===
A collective belief is referred to when people speak of what 'we' believe when this is not simply elliptical for what 'we all' believe.

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all '[[social fact]]s', 'inhered in' social [[Group (sociology)|groups]] as opposed to individual persons. Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure.

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Margaret Gilbert]] has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons to accept a certain belief as a body. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it themselves.  Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

===Glover===
Jonathan Glover believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.

[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (e.g., it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;]]
Glover suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. It always implicates and relates to other beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; (e.g., with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (e.g., some people may not realize they have racist belief systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[René Descartes]], saying about Descartes that "[h]e starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman." To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: "Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating."&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more deeply held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more openmindedly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html "Jonathan Glover on systems of belief", Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GloverBeliefs&gt;[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
The British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as "[[wiktionary:claptrap|claptrap]]" and said that they "draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves to victory... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again".&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Church of Cognizance''' ('''COC''') was founded in 1991 by Danuel &amp; Mary Quaintance&lt;ref&gt;[http://danmary.org dan&amp;mary's Monastery-HEMPorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530103628/http://danmary.org/ |date=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Graham County (Pima) [[Arizona]], [[United States]].

==Beginnings==
In 1994, the Quaintances recorded a 16-page "Declaration of Religious Sentiment" concretizing the establishment of their church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc-recording.pdf ''Coc-declaration'']&lt;/ref&gt; The COC Founders recording announced their intent to unite the world's ethnic minorities that utilize and rely upon the [[cannabis]] hemp plant as an ethno-socio-religious institution following Neo-Zoroastrian tenets.

While COC members are encouraged to study all of the world's religions, the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]] is held by them to be the least convoluted and most ancient source supporting their practices and beliefs. Numerous references to [[Haoma]] may be found in the Avesta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/y9to11s.PDF ''Translated Avesta Yasna 9-11'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the COC with 40 to 50 members in Arizona, nationwide had 72 registered Individual Orthodox Member Monasteries (IOMMs), which are located inside members' homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216222414/http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/137087.php ''(Archived) Arizona Daily Star - Pot church takes a hit '']&lt;/ref&gt;

==COC Membership==
To become a "registered member" of the COC, a candidate must read a pamphlet titled "The Church Of Cognizance Introduced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/pledge.pdf ''The Church Of Cognizance Introduced'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet includes the below stated beliefs, description of organization, and the membership pledge of the church. If the candidate is in agreement with the beliefs, organization, and pledge, they then must then fill out, and sign their PLEDGE and return it to the designated address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iomm.info ''(Official) COC Membership page''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605230913/http://iomm.info/ |date=2013-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Members of the COC claim to believe:

1. That [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as [[Haoma]], when raised and used properly, aids the mind, body, and soul.

2. That Haoma is the ancient teacher of wisdom, compassion, and the way to the kingdom of glory in heaven on earth, while humans let ego block their own, and others, path to this kingdom of glory.

3. That Haoma is the capable provider of all substance required to accommodate a comfortable, healthy, productive, full-bearing life.

4. That Haoma is the righteous Protector of their health, and longevity; by way of receptors in the human body that believe Haoma connects with to heal.

Based on their beliefs, they declare Marijuana/Cannabis/Haoma to be "the teacher, the protector, the provider". And further, that the proper religious use promotes "Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds, none of which is harmful to the health, safety, welfare, or morals of society in general".

===Organization===
The COC is composed of "Family Oriented Monastic Orders" wherein members are dedicated to promoting the health, safety, welfare, culture, and tradition of the family thru their belief:

1. That the physically able, retired adults, of the family should care for the sick, the eldest, and the youngest of the family.

:      a. The eldest of the family whom have provided in the past should not be forgotten and tossed aside for strangers to care for.

:      b. The children of the family need to learn the family’s culture and traditions from a member of the family with that wisdom.

:      c. It allows the able bodied of the family to work and provide for the entire family without the worry of who's caring for their offspring, and whose customs and traditions they are taught.

:      d. It keeps family together, helping family, and the family as a whole may become Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise.

Each Family Oriented Monastic Order of the Church Of Cognizance is designated an "Individual Orthodox Member Monastery" (IOMM).

===Members Pledge===
By submitting their application, prospective members pledge their allegiance, and support, to the Church Of Cognizance and the IOMMs of which it is composed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coc.enlightener.net/coc/documents/coc_pledge.pdf ''Members Pledge'']&lt;/ref&gt; Their pledge requires:

:       a. That they will do their best to live an honorable life; in a family oriented mode; as described in The Church Of Cognizance Belief’s Introduced.

:       b. That they will not allow any Marijuana raised for religious use to enter into commerce, nor will they provide marijuana to anyone outside of the Church Of Cognizance; other than in providing for the religious use by a potential member; and, that use must be under their direct supervision.

:       c. They agree that until such time as the governments end their war against the sacrament of the COC, they will keep any cultivation, or use, confined to a secluded, secure area, in order to mitigate government fears regarding child endangerment.

:       d. They understand that it is a duty of theirs to share the bounty of any harvest with the sick, and dying free of charge; when requested, if they are aware, or made aware, of it being beneficial in such situations.

:       e. And last, that they will respect other family’s lifestyles by agreeing not to introduce any minors into the Marijuana Religion.

==Founders' arrest, prosecution and sentencing==

On February 22, 2006, the founders of the Church of Cognizance, Danuel and Mary Quaintance, were arrested with 172 pounds of marijuana. They asserted that the marijuana was for religious use, an argument which US District court judge Judith C. Herrera rejected outright. The federal judge stated that the evidence shows the two created the church and beliefs as a way of justifying their lifestyle choice to use marijuana and their belief that marijuana should be legalized.  She further stated they cannot avoid prosecution for illegal conduct by simply calling their conduct a religion.  Also it was noted that the monasteries were all located in members' homes.  The church states a "declaration of religious sentiment" on behalf of the Church of Cognizance was filed with the Graham County Recorder's Office 12 years prior this arrest in 1994. Further noted was that the Quaintances had not faced any prior criminal charges related to their church and that they do not grow marijuana but pick it up from church "couriers", which is what they were doing when they were arrested.  Both founders stepped down as leaders of the church following their arrests. But the couple hope to one day resume what they view as their worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azstarnet.com/lifestyles/faith-and-values/court-overrules-church-s-use-of-pot-as-sacrament/article_55458b9c-880d-5aaf-a4cf-5c424612aa3e.html ''Arizona Daily Star - Court overrules church's use of pot as sacrament '']&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2008, they both pleaded guilty to two counts. One count of conspiracy with intent to distribute 200 pounds or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana; and one count of possession with the intent to distribute 100 pounds or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana, as well as aiding and abetting.  They faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Danuel Quaintance is serving{{When|date=November 2017}} a five-year sentence at a facility at the Federal Correctional Institute in Terminal Island, California, near Long Beach. Mary Quaintance is serving two years at the Victorville Federal Correctional Complex in Adelanto, Calif.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html "Pot Church Copes With Jailed Leaders"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614055400/http://www.kpho.com/news/20943492/detail.html |date=June 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they both were confident that an appeal based on their claimed religious use would keep them out of prison,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/faith/256138 "Arizona Daily Star - Pot-deifying duo guilty, confident they'll avoid prison"]&lt;/ref&gt; a unanimous three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 19, 2010, affirmed the denial of the couple’s RFRA defense in ''United States v. Quaintance''. The panel agreed that evidence in the case established that the Quaintances had failed to establish that their beliefs about marijuana as a sacred substance were sincerely held, further concluding that “the record contains … overwhelming evidence that the Quaintances were running a commercial marijuana business with a religious front — particularly in this transaction aimed at securing bail money for Ms. Quaintance’s brother.” &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100713031740/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=22979 ''Church founders can't escape drug charges  '']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VHS-Video-Tape-Top-Flat.jpg|thumb|The VHS cassette in the [[Japanese horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']] is an example of a dark medium.]]
'''Dark media''' are a type of media outlined by American philosopher [[Eugene Thacker]].

==Overview==
Discussed at length in the essay of the same name, Eugene Thacker writes that dark media are media that function too well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thacker writes that, "dark media have, as their aim, the mediation of that which is unavailable or inaccessible to the senses, and thus that which we are normally "in the dark" about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically in works of [[Horror fiction|Horror]], dark media are relatively commonplace media that show more of the world than is expected, with the dark medium showing what lies beyond the possibility of human sense. Dark media are significant in their ability to breach the, typically unbridgeable, gap between objects being mediated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; With dark media, as shown in the [[Japanese horror|J-Horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']], dark media can create a point between the natural and the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ring'', the dark medium of the [[VHS|VHS cassette]] makes it possible for antagonist [[Sadako Yamamura]] to cross the threshold of a tv, and subsequently kill those that have viewed the videotape.

==Examples of dark media==
* Videotape from [[Ring (film)|''Ring'' (200000006)]].
* Machine from ''[[Long Distance Wireless Photography]]''.
* Webcam from [[Pulse (2001 film)|''Pulse'' (2001)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1610">'''Devla''' (also called, Del) is the name of [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] in the [[Roma people|Roma]] religion. Devla was mistaken with the [[devil]] by the general public when the O Roma tribes arrived in [[Europe]] during the 12th century. Devla is often mentioned in Roma folk songs.

When Romanes is translated into English, the word Devla is usually translated as "God", as shown here in this Romanes language textbook:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENqAjucuu4MC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=devla+roma&amp;source=web&amp;ots=j-bfQ07JWV&amp;sig=zJB7LzzlNPgWQMbJ5-D-2AQCUSs.|title=Learn Romani: Das-Duma Rromanes|first=Ronald|last=Lee|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|accessdate=17 September 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roma Catholics also refer to the Catholic God as Devla or Del when they speak [[Roma language|Romanes,]] although these Roma words existed in traditional Roma folk beliefs and in [[Romani language|the Roma language]] centuries before any Roma adopted Christianity.  That is, "Devla" is a common noun meaning a "God" It is based on the Sanskrit word "Deva" which is related to the Latin words "deus" (god) and "divinus" (godly, godlike). "O DEl" or "DEl" is based on the Israelite word "El Elyon" and "ELOI" meaning "God Most High" ("God the highest").


There is a common misconception among many Gadje (non-Roma persons) that Roma worship the devil. The Kalderash word for devil, or Satan, is "Beng".

[[File:Oscar II, Svensk porträttgalleri.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] in a pre-1900 photograph.]]
'''Dissenter Acts''' ({{lang-sv|Dissenterlagarna}}) were laws, enacted by the [[Monarchy of Sweden|King of Sweden]] with the consent of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]], which gave [[nonconformism|nonconformist]]s who wanted to leave the then established [[Church of Sweden]] the right to do so, provided that the [[dissenter]]s then joined one of the state-approved denominations. The first such edict was decreed in 1860 by [[Charles XV of Sweden|Karl XV]] and the ''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Ståndsriksdag]]''; the second one in 1873 by [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]] and the reorganized bicameral ''[[History of the Riksdag|Riksdag]]''. Neither the ''Ståndsriksdag'', divided into four Estates, nor the newer ''Riksdag'' could be said to be truly democratic, though, as the [[suffrage]] was restricted to males who owned property. The 1873 edict remained in force until the 1951 Religious Freedom Act (''religionsfrihetslag''); the Church of Sweden remained the established state church until 2000.

Despite the enactment of the Dissenter Acts, nonconformists were still required to financially support the then established Church of Sweden:

:The state religion is the Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, in the sense that the churches which have concurred in this creed are described as a state church, placed under the king's (government's) "supervision, care and defence," for which the state so defines its constitution and economy that the King and his Cabinet Council determines the religion. This religion is taught in state schools and has special constitutional protection; furthermore, its clergy constitute an Estate of the realm. There shall be a Board of Education to which the king will appoint church officials. '''Holidays of the state church shall be respected even by adherents of foreign creeds, who also must contribute to its expenses.''' The king and parliament participate in the establishment of canon law; the king establishes the church bylaws. It has even happened that His Royal Majesty has contributed government funds to reward preachers who have countered heterodox dissenters. The king is ''summus episcopus'' (archbishop), the Church's head and governor (''cujus est regio, illius est religio'', "The religion of a country is that of its ruler"), with a territorial system as opposed to hierarchical and self-governing systems.&lt;ref name="hagman"&gt;"''Statsreligion är den ev.-lutherska läran så till vida, att det kyrkosamfund, som anslutit sig till denna trosbekännelse, betecknas såsom statskyrka, d. v. s. står under konungens (statens) »uppsikt, vård och försvar», hvarför staten ordnar dess författning och ekonomi.

'''Entering Heaven alive''' (called by various [[religion]]s "ascension", "assumption", or "[[Translation (Mormonism)|translation]]") is a belief held in various religions. Since [[death]] is the normal end to an individual's life on [[Earth]] and the beginning of [[afterlife]], entering [[Heaven]] without dying first is considered exceptional and usually a sign of a [[deity]]'s special recognition of the individual's [[piety]].

==Christianity==
[[File:5029-20080122-jerusalem-mt-olives-ascension-rock.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Ascension Rock, inside the [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)]], is said to bear the imprint of Jesus' right foot as he left earth and ascended into heaven.&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{See also|Ascension of Jesus|Rapture|Biblical cosmology}}

Unlike the other entries in this article, this paragraph does not, in the view of most Christians, relate to "entering Heaven alive". Jesus is considered by the vast majority of Christians to have died before being resurrected and ascending to heaven. In regard to his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] considers her to have died prior to being assumed (translated) into heaven. In like manner, [[Roman Catholicism]] affirms that Mary, the mother of Jesus, suffered death prior to her assumption which has been "expressly affirmed in the Liturgy of the Church" and is expressly seen in paragraph 20 of the proclamation of this teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, Ludwig Ott, Book III, Pt. 3, Ch. 2, §6, {{ISBN|0-89555-009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XII / Munificentissimus Deus / Defining the Dogma of the Assumption |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Protestantism]] generally believes that [[Protestant views on Mary|Mary]] died a natural death like any other human being and was not subsequently assumed into heaven, although the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition of [[Anglicanism]] often affirms the assumption.

Most Christians believe [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus did initially die]], but was then [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected from the dead by God]], before being [[Ascension of Jesus|raised bodily to heaven]] to [[Session of Christ|sit]] at the [[Right Hand of God]] with a promise to someday [[Second Coming|return to earth]]. The minority views that Jesus didn't die are known as the [[Swoon hypothesis]] and [[Docetism]]. 

Since the adoption of the [[Nicene Creed]] in 325, the [[Ascension of Jesus]] into heaven, as related in the [[New Testament]], has been officially taught by all orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and is celebrated on [[Ascension Thursday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Ascension of the Lord is a [[Holy Day of Obligation]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the Ascension is one of twelve [[Great Feasts]].

In the Reformed churches' tradition of [[Calvinism]], belief in the ascension of Christ is included in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] and the [[Second Helvetic Confession]]."&lt;ref name=gr&gt;Quotations as cited by Redman, Gary, article/Web page titled [http://debate.org.uk/topics/theo/states_christ_03.html "A Comparison of the Biblical and Islamic Views of the States of Christ]/ Part 2: The State of Exaltation", at "The Muslim-Christian Debate Website". Retrieved March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Rapture" is a reference to "being caught up" as found in [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 4:17, when the "dead in Christ" and "we who are alive and remain" will be caught up in the clouds to meet the [[The Lord|Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Thess|4:16–17|NKJV}} "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of entering Heaven alive is mentioned in the Old Testament: the prophet [[Elijah]] and the patriarch [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], son of Jared and ancestor of Noah.

===Catholicism===
{{Main|Assumption of Mary}}
The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between "The Ascension", in which Christ rose to heaven by his own power, and "The Assumption" in which [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was raised to heaven by God's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/0506-96/Article6.html |last=Brumley |first=Mark, |title=Mary's Assumption: Irrelevant or Irreverent? |publisher=Catholic.net |accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and [[Elijah]] are said in scripture to have been "assumed" [experienced assumption]{{clarification needed|date=April 2017}} into heaven.)

On November 1, 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]], acting ''[[ex cathedra]]'', issued ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]'', an authoritative statement of official doctrine of [[Roman Catholicism]]. In Section 44 the pope stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |title=Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XII / Munificentissimus Deus / Defining the Dogma of the Assumption |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904181017/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.}}

The doctrine is based on [[Sacred Tradition]] that [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], was bodily assumed into heaven. For centuries before that, [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary in art|the assumption was celebrated in art]]. The proclamation states that Mary suffered bodily death before being assumed into Heaven. Some theologians{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} have argued that Mary didn't die, but this is contrary to the text of the dogma's proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.net/RCC/Periodicals/Dossier/0506-96/Article6.html |last=Brumley |first=Mark |title=Mary's Assumption: Irrelevant or Irreverent?|publisher=Catholic.net |accessdate= March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Christianity===
[[File:Theofanus uspenie.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] (1392, [[Theophan the Greek]]).]]
{{Main|Dormition of the Mother of God}}
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] teaches that three other persons were taken bodily into heaven: [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Elijah]] (Elias) and the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary). Similar to the Western "Assumption" of Mary, the Orthodox celebrate the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] on August 15. Unlike Western uncertainty about Mary's physical death, the Orthodox teach that Mary died a natural death like any other human being, that she was buried by the [[Apostles]] (except for [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], who was late), and three days later (after Thomas had arrived) was found to be missing from her tomb. The church teaches that the Apostles received a revelation during which the Theotokos appeared to them and told them she had been resurrected by Jesus and taken body and soul into heaven. The Orthodox teach that Mary already enjoys the fullness of heavenly bliss that the other saints will experience only after the [[Last Judgment]].

There is a teaching among the Orthodox that the "[[Two Witnesses]]" referred to in the [[Book of Revelation]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|11:3–13}} are Enoch and Elijah,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} who will be sent back to earth to preach the Gospel in the time of [[apostasy]], and will be the last Christian [[martyr]]s before the [[Second Coming]]. According to Revelation, they will be resurrected and ascend again to heaven.

She believed that she could create for herself a new kind of “light body”. However, she died and was cremated.

==Islam==
[[File:Jerusalem Dome of the rock BW 3.JPG|thumb|right|The Dome of the Rock]]
{{See also|Kitab al-Miraj}}
Islamic teaching states that [[Muhammad]] ascended into heaven alive at the site of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. However, this ascent was temporary and he came back to Earth. It is ascribed to the exact descriptions presented in both the Quran and the [[Hadith]].

Islamic texts deny the idea of crucifixion or death attributed to [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]] by the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Shafaat, Dr. Ahmad, [http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm Islamic View of the Coming/Return of Jesus"] article dated May 2003, at the ''Islamic Perspectives'' Web site: "In 4:159, after denying that the Jews killed or crucified Jesus and after stating that God raised him to Himself, the Qur`an says ...". Retrieved March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] states that people (i.e., the Jews and Romans) sought to kill Jesus, but they could not crucify or kill him, although "this was made to appear to them". Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead he was raised by God unto the heavens. This "raising" is often understood to mean through bodily ascension.

Some Islamic scholars have identified the prophet [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] to be the same person as [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] from the Bible. This is because the Qu'ran states that God "raised him to a lofty station", and that has been taken to be a term for ascending, upon which it is concluded that "Idris" was "Enoch".

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew bible the word for "heavens" is ''[[Heaven in Judaism|shamayim]]''. This is plural - it means "heavens", not "heaven" - but seems nevertheless to have a singular meaning: i.e., the older parts of the bible speak of "heavens" in the plural but evidence for a belief in more than one heaven from the bible is lacking. Shamayim also meant "sky", the atmosphere, as it does in modern English. The blue dome of the sky was called the ''[[Firmament|raqia]]'', and was believed to be a solid shield between the atmosphere and the true heaven where God lived.{{dubious|date=December 2016}} Heaven was the realm of God, earth of mankind, and the [[underworld]] was for the dead, and travel between them was generally impossible, although God and his messengers frequently appear on earth and the dead can be summoned up from the underworld as the [[Witch of Endor]] summons the shade of Samuel.

There are two possible exceptions to this general rule that humans could not go to heaven, Enoch and Elijah, but neither is clear. The [[Book of Genesis]] mentions [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as one who "was no more" because "God took him", but it does not explicitly say whether he was alive or dead, and it does not say where God took him. The [[Books of Kings]] describes the prophet [[Elijah]] being taken towards "shamayim" in a whirlwind, but the word can mean both heaven as the abode of God, or the sky (as the word "heavens" does in modern English), and so again the text is ambiguous.

According to the post-biblical [[Jewish]] [[Midrash]], eight people went to heaven (also referred to as the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Paradise]]) alive:&lt;ref&gt;''Derekh Erez Zuta'' (post-Talmudic tractate) cited in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'' New York 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascended Master Teachings==

They also believe numerous others have undergone Ascension; they are called the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] and are worshipped in this group of religions. The leaders of these religions claim to be able to receive [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channeled messages]] from the Ascended Masters, which they then relay to their followers.&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

* In the [[fictional universe]] of the ''[[Stargate]]'' franchise, the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], have learned how to "ascend" from the physical plane and have [[Ascension (Stargate)|moved on to a higher plane of existence]].
* In [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', Remedios the Beauty, is said to be the most beautiful woman ever seen in Macondo, who unintentionally causes the deaths of several men who love or lust over her. She appears to most of the town as naively innocent, and some come to think that she is mentally handicapped. However, Colonel Aureliano Buendía believes she has inherited great lucidity: "It is as if she's come back from twenty years of war", he said. She rejects clothing and beauty. Too beautiful and, arguably, too wise for the world, Remedios ascends into the sky one afternoon in the 4pm sun, while folding Fernanda's white sheet.

[[Ethics]] involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A central aspect of ethics is "the good life", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional [[Morality|moral]] conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1993) ''Practical Ethics'', 2nd edition (p.10), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[religion]]s have an [[ethics|ethical]] component, often derived from purported supernatural [[revelation]] or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Blackburn states that there are those who "would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Simon|first= Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist ethics==
{{Main|Buddhist ethics}}
Ethics in [[Buddhism]] are traditionally based on the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] perspective of the [[Buddha]], or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in [[Buddhist scriptures]] or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]]: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see [[vinaya]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The sole reliance on traditional formulae or practices, however, can be questioned by Western Buddhists whose main concern is the practical solution of complex moral problems in the modern world. To find a justifiable approach to such problems it may be necessary not just to appeal to the precepts or the ''vinaya'', but to use more basic Buddhist teachings (such as the [[Middle Way]]) to aid interpretation of the precepts and find more basic justifications for their usefulness relevant to all human experience. This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha's enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity'' (Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has observed:
:"Buddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. ... [I]t has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the "immeasurables" — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (1994). For other examples of Buddhist discourses that promote ethical behaviors among laity see, for instance, the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] (referred to as "the [[Vinaya]] of the householder" by [[Buddhaghosa]]) and the [[Dhammika Sutta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Christian ethics}}
{{See also|Sermon on the Mount|The New Commandment|Ministry of Jesus}}

Christian ethics in general has tended to stress the need for love, [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. With divine assistance, the Christian is called to become increasingly [[Virtuous#Christian tradition|virtuous]] in both thought and deed, see also the [[Evangelical counsels]]. Conversely, the Christian is also called to abstain from [[vice]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Christian ethical principles are based on the teachings within the [[Bible]]. They begin with the notion of inherent sinfulness, which requires essential [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Sin is estrangement from God which is the result of not doing God's will.  God's will can be summed up by the precept: "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself", commonly called the [[Great Commandment]]. Christian ethics are founded upon the concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which transforms a person's life and enable's one to choose and act righteously.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As sin is both individual and social, so is grace applied to both the individual and society.  Christian ethics has a [[teleological]] aspect—all ethical behavior is oriented towards a vision of the [[Kingdom of God]]—a righteous society where all live in peace and harmony with God and nature, as envisioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]]. Specific ethical behaviors originate in the [[Old Testament]]’s [[Ten Commandments]], and are enriched by teachings in the Psalms and morals contained in historical accounts, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

Christian ethics is not substantially different from [[Jewish ethics]], except in the exhortation to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Perhaps the greatest contribution of Christian ethics is this command to love one's enemies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It has been argued (see [[Ched Myers]]'s ''Binding the Strong Man'', and [[John Howard Yoder]]'s ''The Politics of Jesus'') that Jesus was waging a [[Nonviolent revolution|non-violent campaign]] against the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Roman oppressors]] and many of his sayings relate to this campaign--[[turn the other cheek]], go the second mile, etc. Understanding these commands as part of a larger campaign makes it impossible to interpret Christian ethics as an individual ethic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It is both an individual and a social ethic concerned with life here on earth.

Other tenets include maintaining personal integrity and the absence of hypocrisy, as well as honesty and loyalty, mercy and forgiveness, rejection of materialism and the desire for wealth and power, and teaching others in your life through personal joy, happiness and Godly devotion.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There are several different schema of vice and virtue. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (from St.Paul, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13}}). Other schema include the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] and the [[Seven virtues]]. For more see [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

==Confucian ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Confucianism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one's relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or [[situational ethics]]. The Confucian system differs very strongly from [[Kantian ethics]] in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.

This is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in [[Zhou Dynasty]] China, the Confucians' main opponents, the followers of [[Mozi]] argued for universal love ({{Zh|s=兼爱|p=jiān ài}}). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that [[Mao Zedong]] was more Confucian than Communist.
Confucianism, especially of the type argued for by [[Mencius]] ({{Zh|s=孟子|p=mèng zĭ}}), argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) "acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it". In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.

Confucius stresses [[honesty]] above all. His concepts of [[lĭ]] ({{Zh|s=理}}), [[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]] ({{Zh|s=義}}), and [[Ren (Confucianism)|rén]] ({{Zh|s=仁}}) can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty ({{Zh|s=誠|p=[[chéng]]|l=[[sincerity]]}}) and [[fidelity]] ({{Zh|s=孝|p=[[xiào]]}}) to the ones to whom one owes one's existence (parents) and survival (one's neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid [[property rights]], hard to distinguish from any other [[dictatorship]]. Traditional ethics had been perverted by [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]].

===Buddhist influence===
Buddhism, and specifically [[Mahayana Buddhism]], brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism's dominance in the [[Tang dynasty]], and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.

==Daoist ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Laozi]] (Lao Tzu) and other [[Daoist|Taoist]] (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' 禮), culture (''[[Chinese culture|wen]]'' 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.

Taoist ethics ask for a greater ''sense of being'' and less identification with ''the act of''  ''doing''.  Taoist ''passivity'' nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows ''the majestic'' and ''the real'' to shine, which influences society for the better.    - "If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself.  Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation."   - Lao Tzu

Kane]], the author of the [[History of Dharmaśāstra|History of Dharmasastra]] said, the term "Dharma" does not have a synonym in English language. While it is often interpreted as meaning "duty", it can mean justice, right, moral, good, and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kane, P.V.

Ethics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};

Ethics that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K.

The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The Persian historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 1), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000130.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter VII], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), page 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; These correspond to five ''[[Yamas]]'' of ancient Hindu ethics: [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Satya]] (truth, non-falsehood), [[Asteya]] (non-stealing), [[Brahmacharya]] (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one's partner if married), and [[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness).&lt;ref name=ah&gt;Andrea Hornett (2012), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and Forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-642-32445-1}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-78&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these five negative things to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends five positive things to strive for as ''[[Niyamas]]'': ''[[Shaucha|Śauca]]'' (purity in body, speech and mind), ''Santosha'' (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (perseverance, meditation, austerity), ''Swadhyaya'' (lifelong learning) and ''Pranidhan'' (right attitude, contemplation).&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Hindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) ''Gunas'' that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) ''Purushartha'' that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness ([[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]]); (3) ''Ashramas'' that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) ''Varnasramas'' that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=wfg&gt;William F. Goodwin, Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan., 1955), pp. 321-344&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes:&lt;ref name=agw/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept,&lt;ref name=wfg2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Fall, 2002), pp. 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, pages 87-96, 111-114, 131-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Reichenbach (1988), The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]—considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of ‘Just War’. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339-361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K.

L. (2013), Comparing the Golden Rule in Hindu and Christian Religious Texts. Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses, 42(1), pages 38-58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic ethics==
{{Main|Islamic ethics}}{{See also|Halal|Haram}}
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence, which, as [[John Kelsay]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Ethics'' phrases, "ultimately points to the reality of God." Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]], or the sayings of Muhammad) {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;''Islamic ethics'', Encyclopedia of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "ignorance."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Macho|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one's near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Furthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example,Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran . The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility.  A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:

“And turn not your face away from people (with pride), nor walk in insolence through the earth.  Verily, God likes not each arrogant boaster.  And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice.  Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.”  (Quran 31:18-19)

Muslims must be in controls of their passions and desires.

A Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand.  Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.
Morality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim's life, from greetings to international relations.  It is universal in its scope and in its applicability.  Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits.  Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue.  They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them.  In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.

“You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.” (Quran: 3:110)

Muhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:

“My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him  who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.”

==Jewish ethics==
{{Main|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be said to originate with the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.

In early rabbinic Judaism, the [[Oral Torah]] both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with [[ethics]] is the non-legal [[Mishnah]] [[Mishnah|tractate]] of ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'', popularly translated as ''Ethics of the Fathers''. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as [[aggadah]], and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal ([[halakhic]]) portions of the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and other rabbinic literature.  This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early [[Christian]] tradition.

In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, [[Maimonides]] offers a Jewish interpretation of [[Aristotle]] (e.g., ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences [[Thomas Aquinas]], a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the [[natural law]] tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval [[Jewish philosophy]] is a matter of dispute among scholars.

===Hellenistic influence===
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
Ethics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of [[IV Maccabees]], the [[Book of Wisdom]], and [[Philo]].

Much progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the [[Wisdom literature]] shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view [[Ben Sira]]'s collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.

More developed ethical works emanated from [[Hasidean]] circles in the [[Maccabean]] time, such as are contained in [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], especially in Chapter IV. Here the first [[ethical will]] or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the [[Golden Rule]], "Do that to no man which thou hatest!" as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children's children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God's favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one's fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the [[Book of Enoch|Ethiopic Enoch]] (xciv. et seq.) and the [[Slavonic Enoch]] (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.

The Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, [[idolatry]], [[murder]], and [[incest]], were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] these [[Noachide Laws]] were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.

==Germanic Neopagan ethics==
[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagans]], including followers of both [[Asatru]] and [[Theodism]], try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples ([[Norsemen|Norse]] or [[Anglo-Saxon]]) through the form of the [[Nine Noble Virtues]].

==Scientology ethics==
{{Main|Ethics (Scientology)}}
Scientology ethics is based upon the concepts of [[good and evil]]. Ethics may be defined as the actions an individual takes on itself to ensure its continued survival across the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232906/http://scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular ethics==
{{Main|Morality without religion}} {{See also|Secular ethics}}
Secular ethics is a [[moral philosophy]] in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including [[consequentialism]], [[freethinking]], [[humanism]], [[secular humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]], among others.

The majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of [[natural rights]] and [[social contract]]s, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianesque]] [[ethical intuitionism]] or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with [[Occam's razor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Approaches such as [[ethical egoism]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral skepticism]], and [[moral nihilism]] are also considered.

==Shinto ethics==
Shinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the "desirable and required order".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt; Shinto adherents are to "realize and carry out the will of the ''kami'' and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt;

Although State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for "blessings of the ''kami''", and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"/&gt;

==Wiccan ethics==
{{Main|Wiccan morality}}
Wiccan morality is largely based on the [[Wiccan Rede]]: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' -- old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean "do no harm at all", it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Harrow, Judy (1985) [http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm "Exegesis on the Rede"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QgCzLc0I?url=http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm |date=2007-07-28 }} in ''[[Harvest (Neopagan magazine)|Harvest]]'' vol. 5, Number 3 ([[Oimelc]] 1985). Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of Wiccan Morality comes from the [[Rule of Three (Wiccan)|Law of Threefold Return]], which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], ''High Magic's Aid'', London: Michael Houghton, 1949, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in [[Doreen Valiente]]'s ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] &amp; [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]], ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; these being [[Gladness|mirth]], [[reverence (emotion)|reverence]], [[honour]], [[humility]], strength, [[beauty]], [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[compassion]]. In Valiente's poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

{{Platonism}}

The '''Euthyphro dilemma''' is found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Euthyphro]]'', in which [[Socrates]] asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]], "Is the [[piety|pious]] ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) loved by the [[deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" ([[Stephanus pagination|10a]]) It implies that if moral authority must come from the gods it does not have to be good, and if moral authority must be good it does not have to come from the gods – a highly controversial idea at the time Socrates first presented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Was the Charge Against Socrates? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-the-charge-against-socrates-121060 |website=Thoughtco |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the argument applied to the many capricious gods of [[ancient Greece]], it has implications for the [[monotheism|monotheistic religions]] of today. "Is what is [[good and evil|morally good]] commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?"&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Leibniz stated, in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-010-1426-7_60#page-1 ''Reflections on the Common Concept of Justice''] (circa 1702):  "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since Plato's original discussion, this question has presented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a [[false dilemma]], and it continues to be an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.

==The dilemma==
Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato's ''[[Euthyphro]]''. Euthyphro proposes (6e) that the pious ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods ([[:wikt:θεοφιλής|τὸ θεοφιλές]]), but Socrates finds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then revises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).

At this point the [[dilemma]] surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both contemplate the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very ''nature'' of the pious, but at most a ''quality'' of the pious (11ab).

==In philosophical theism==
The dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[Gottfried Leibniz]] presented this version of the dilemma: "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=516}}

Many philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato, though not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar [[Terence Irwin]], the issue and its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2006}} More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers working in [[metaethics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend theism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.

=== God commands it because it is right ===

====Supporters====
The first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God ''because it is right'') goes by a variety of names, including [[intellectualism]], [[rationalism]], [[Moral realism|realism]], [[Natural law|naturalism]], and [[Moral universalism|objectivism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The [[Mu'tazilah]] school of [[Islamic theology]] also defended the view (with, for example, [[Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Nazzam]] maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying),{{sfn|Wolfson|1976|p=579}} as did the [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] [[Averroes]].{{sfn|Hourani|1962|pp=13–40}} [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue.{{sfn|Haldane|1989|p=40}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=I, pp. 553–556}} Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]] (adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal).{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}} Among later [[Scholastics]], [[Gabriel Vásquez]] is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's.{{sfn|Pink|2005}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=II, pp. 6–10}} [[Early modern period|Modern]] natural law theory saw [[Grotius]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] also putting morality prior to [[Will of God|God's will]], comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarists]] like [[Pufendorf]] in philosophical controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See esp. {{harvnb|Grotius|1625|loc=1.1.10}} and {{harvnb|Leibniz 1702(?)}}; see also {{harvnb|Leibniz|1706|pp=64–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Platonists]] like [[Benjamin Whichcote]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist [[metaethics]] of [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[Richard Price]];{{sfn|Gill|1999|loc=esp. pp. 272–74}}{{sfn|Mackie|1980|loc=Chapters 2, 8}}{{sfn|Gill|2011}} what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary [[Philosophy of religion|philosophers of religion]] who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include [[Richard Swinburne]]{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|pp=209–216}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}} and [[T. J. Mawson]]{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} (though see below for complications).

====Criticisms====

* [[Sovereignty]]: If there are moral standards independent of God's will, then "[t]here is something over which God is not sovereign. God is bound by the laws of morality instead of being their establisher. Moreover, God depends for his goodness on the extent to which he conforms to an independent moral standard. Thus, God is not absolutely independent."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=247}} 18th-century philosopher [[Richard Price]], who takes the first horn and thus sees morality as "necessary and immutable", sets out the objection as follows: "It may seem that this is setting up something distinct from God, which is independent of him, and equally eternal and necessary."{{sfn|Price|1769|loc=Chapter 5}}
* [[Omnipotence]]: These moral standards would limit God's power: not even God could oppose them by commanding what is evil and thereby making it good.  This point was influential in Islamic theology: "In relation to God, objective values appeared as a limiting factor to His power to do as He wills... [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Ash'ari]] got rid of the whole embarrassing problem by denying the existence of objective values which might act as a standard for God's action."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=276}} Similar concerns drove the medieval voluntarists [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]].{{sfn|Haldane|1989|pp=42–43}} As contemporary philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] puts the point, this horn "seems to place a restriction on God's power if he cannot make any action which he chooses obligatory... [and also] it seems to limit what God can command us to do. God, if he is to be God, cannot command us to do what, independently of his will, is wrong."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}}
* [[Free will|Freedom of the will]]: Moreover, these moral standards would limit God's freedom of will: God could not command anything opposed to them, and perhaps would have no choice but to command in accordance with them.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} for a detailed discussion of this problem; also see {{harvnb|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6.22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Mark Murphy (philosopher)|Mark Murphy]] puts the point, "if moral requirements existed prior to God's willing them, requirements that an impeccable God could not violate, God's liberty would be compromised."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#2.1 Metaethical theological voluntarism: Considerations in Favor]}}
* [[Secular morality|Morality without God]]: If there are moral standards independent of God, then morality would retain its authority even if God did not exist. This conclusion was explicitly (and notoriously) drawn by early modern political theorist [[Hugo Grotius]]: "What we have been saying [about the natural law] would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him"{{sfn|Grotius|1625|loc=Prolegomenon, 11}} On such a view, God is no longer a "law-giver" but at most a "law-transmitter" who plays no vital role in the foundations of morality.{{sfn|Kretzmann|1999|p=423}} [[Nontheism|Nontheists]] have capitalized on this point, largely as a way of disarming [[Argument from morality|moral arguments for God's existence]]: if morality does not depend on God in the first place, such arguments stumble at the starting gate.{{sfn|Oppy|2009|pp=352–356}}

====Responses to criticisms====
Contemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the dilemma, branding divine command theory a "subjective theory of value" that makes morality arbitrary.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=143–145}} They accept a theory of morality on which, "right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent of what ''anyone'' believes, wants, or prefers."{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=145–147}} They do not address the aforementioned problems with the first horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God's omnipotence: namely, that it might be handicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is omnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of "maximal power", not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is impossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is therefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but not [[omnibenevolent]]). Thus God's omnipotence remains intact.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=166, 173–176}}

[[Richard Swinburne]] and [[T. J. Mawson]] have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first horn of the dilemma when it comes to ''necessary'' moral truths. But divine commands are not totally irrelevant, for God and his will can still affect ''contingent'' moral truths.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 11}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} On the one hand, the most fundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded: "Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person issued."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}} This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]]: like the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=192ff}} This parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God's sovereignty, omnipotence, and freedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 9}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=217–222}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=26–29}} On the other hand, there is still an important role for God's will. First, there are some divine commands that can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|p=211}} Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn of the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of God's role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral truth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=211–215}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|pp=10–12}} Second, God can make an ''indirect'' moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public policy is morally good might indirectly depend on God's creative acts: the policy's goodness or badness might depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has decided to create.{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=29–32}}

===It is right because God commands it===

====Supporters====

The second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right ''because it is commanded by God'') is sometimes known as [[divine command theory]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are no moral standards other than God's will: without God's commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This view was partially defended by [[Duns Scotus]], who argued that not all [[Ten Commandments]] belong to the [[Natural Law]] in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus held that while our duties to God (the first three commandments, traditionally thought of as the First Tablet) are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without.

[[William of Ockham]] went further, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Quodlibeta'' 3.13&lt;/ref&gt; and even to ''hate'' God.&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Reportata'' 4.16; see also {{harvnb|Osborne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Scholastics]] like [[Pierre D'Ailly]] and his student [[Jean Gerson|Jean de Gerson]] explicitly confronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not "command good actions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good because they are commanded and evil because prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;D'Ailly, Pierre. ''Questions on the Books of the Sentences'' 1.14; quoted in {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}}, quoting Idziak 63–4; see {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}} for similar quotes from Gerson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestant]] reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God's will, with Luther writing that "for [God's] will there is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it",{{sfn|Luther|1525|loc=§88}} and Calvin writing that "everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it."{{sfn|Calvin|1536|loc= 3.23.2}} The voluntarist emphasis on God's absolute power was carried further by [[Descartes]], who notoriously held that God had freely created the eternal truths of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and that God was therefore capable of giving [[circles]] unequal [[radii]],{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 25}} giving [[triangles]] other than 180 internal degrees, and even making [[contradictions]] true.{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 235}} Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: "why should [God] not have been able to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?"{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 343}} [[Thomas Hobbes]] notoriously reduced the justice of God to "irresistible power"&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "Of Liberty and Necessity" 12&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing the complaint of [[John Bramhall|Bishop Bramhall]] that this "overturns... all law").&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "A Defense of True Liberty", 12f&lt;/ref&gt; And [[William Paley]] held that all moral obligations bottom out in the self-interested "urge" to avoid [[Hell]] and enter [[Heaven]] by acting in accord with God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, William. "Principles" 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's [[Ash'ari|Ash'arite theologians]], [[al-Ghazali]] foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George Hourani writes that the view "was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other civilization."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=270}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Frank|1994|pp=32–36}} for the view that al-Ghazali incorporated rationalist elements that moved him away from traditional Ash'arite voluntarism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wittgenstein]] said that of "the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good", that which holds that "the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it" is "the deeper", while that which holds that "God wills the good, because it is good" is "the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves 'as though' that which is good could be given some further foundation".&lt;ref name=Janik&gt;{{harvnb|Janik|Toulmin|1973|p=194}}. The passage is also quoted in {{harvnb|Baggett|2002|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, divine command theory is defended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).

====Criticisms====

This horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:

* No reasons for morality: If there is no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are arbitrary (i.e., based on pure whimsy or caprice). This would mean that morality is ultimately not based on reasons: "if theological voluntarism is true, then God's commands/intentions must be arbitrary; [but] it cannot be that morality could wholly depend on something arbitrary... [for] when we say that some moral state of affairs obtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of affairs obtaining rather than another."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#3.2 Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism: Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness]}} And as [[Michael J. Murray]] and [[Michael Rea]] put it, this would also "cas[t] doubt on the notion that morality is genuinely objective."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|pp=246–247}} An additional problem is that it is difficult to explain how true moral actions can exist if one acts only out of fear of God or in an attempt to be rewarded by him.{{sfn|Doomen|2011}}
* No reasons for God: This arbitrariness would also jeopardize God's status as a [[Wisdom|wise]] and [[Rationality|rational]] being, one who always acts on good reasons. As Leibniz writes: "Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act."{{sfn|Leibniz|1686|loc=II}}
* Anything goes:{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} This arbitrariness would also mean that ''anything'' could become good, and ''anything'' could become bad, merely upon God's command. Thus if God commanded us "to gratuitously inflict pain on each other"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} or to engage in "cruelty for its own sake"{{sfn|Adams|1973}} or to hold an "annual sacrifice of randomly selected ten-year-olds in a particularly gruesome ritual that involves excruciating and prolonged suffering for its victims",{{sfn|Morriston|2009|p=249}} then we would be morally obligated to do so. As 17th-century philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] put it: "nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just, and righteous."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.1.5}}
* Moral [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]: If morality depends on the [[Free will|perfectly free will]] of God, morality would lose its necessity: "If nothing prevents God from loving things that are different from what God actually loves, then goodness can change [[Possible world|from world to world]] or time to time. This is obviously objectionable to those who believe that claims about morality are, if true, necessarily true."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} In other words, no action is necessarily moral: any right action could have easily been wrong, if God had so decided, and an action which is right today could easily become wrong tomorrow, if God so decides. Indeed, some have argued that divine command theory is incompatible with ordinary conceptions of moral [[supervenience]].{{sfn|Klagge|1984|pp=374–375}}
* Why do God's commands obligate?: Mere commands do not create obligations unless the commander has some commanding authority. But this commanding authority cannot itself be based on those very commands (i.e., a command to obey commands), otherwise a vicious circle results. So, in order for God's commands to obligate us, he must derive commanding authority from some source other than his own will. As Cudworth put it: "For it was never heard of, that any one founded all his authority of commanding others, and others {{sic}} obligation or duty to obey his commands, in a law of his own making, that men should be required, obliged, or bound to obey him. Wherefore since the thing willed in all laws is not that men should be bound or obliged to obey; this thing cannot be the product of the meer {{sic}} will of the commander, but it must proceed from something else; namely, the right or authority of the commander."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.2.4}} To avoid the circle, one might say our obligation comes from gratitude to God for creating us. But this presupposes some sort of independent moral standard obligating us to be grateful to our benefactors. As 18th-century philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] writes: "Is the Reason exciting to concur with the Deity this, 'The Deity is our Benefactor?' Then what Reason excites to concur with Benefactors?"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1742|loc=I}} Or finally, one might resort to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]'s view: "The right of nature whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that break his laws, is to be derived, not from his creating them (as if he required obedience, as of gratitude for his benefits), but from his ''irresistible power''."{{sfn|Hobbes|loc=31.5}} In other words, [[might makes right]].
* God's goodness: If ''all'' goodness is a matter of God's will, then what shall become of ''God's'' goodness? Thus [[William P. Alston]] writes, "since the standards of moral goodness are set by divine commands, to say that God is morally good is just to say that he obeys his own commands... that God practises what he preaches, whatever that might be;"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} Hutcheson deems such a view "an insignificant [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], amounting to no more than this, 'That God wills what he wills.'"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1738|loc=2.7.5}} Alternatively, as Leibniz puts it, divine command theorists "deprive God of the designation ''good'': for what cause could one have to praise him for what he does, if in doing something quite different he would have done equally well?"{{sfn|Leibniz|1710|p=176}} A related point is raised by [[C. S. Lewis]]: "if good is to be ''defined'' as what God commands, then the goodness of God Himself is emptied of meaning and the commands of an omnipotent fiend would have the same claim on us as those of the 'righteous Lord.'"{{sfn|Lewis|1943|p=79}} Or again Leibniz: "this opinion would hardly distinguish God from the devil."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=561}} That is, since divine command theory trivializes God's goodness, it is incapable of explaining the difference between God and an all-powerful demon.
* The [[is-ought problem]] and the [[naturalistic fallacy]]: According to [[David Hume]], it is hard to see how moral propositions featuring the relation ''ought'' could ever be deduced from ordinary ''is'' propositions, such as "the being of a God."{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=3.1.1.27}} Divine command theory is thus guilty of deducing moral ''oughts'' from ordinary ''ises'' about God's commands.{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}} In a similar vein, [[G. E. Moore]] argued (with his [[open question argument]]) that the notion ''good'' is indefinable, and any attempts to analyze it in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms are guilty of the so-called "naturalistic fallacy."{{sfn|Moore|1903|loc=Chapters 1, 2, 4}} This would block any theory which analyzes morality in terms of God's will: and indeed, in a later discussion of divine command theory, Moore concluded that "when we assert any action to be right or wrong, we are not merely making an assertion about the attitude of mind towards it of any being or set of beings whatever."{{sfn|Moore|1912|p=79}}
* No morality without God: If all morality is a matter of God's will, then if God does not exist, there is no morality. This is the thought captured in the slogan ([[q:Fyodor Dostoyevsky#The Brothers Karamazov (1879–1880)|often attributed to Dostoevsky]]) "[[The Brothers Karamazov|If God does not exist, everything is permitted.]]" Divine command theorists disagree over whether this is a problem for their view or a virtue of their view. [[Argument from morality|Many argue]] that morality does indeed require God's existence, and that this is in fact a problem for atheism. But divine command theorist [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] contends that this idea ("that no actions would be ethically wrong if there were not a loving God") is one that "will seem (at least initially) implausible to many", and that his theory must "dispel [an] air of paradox."{{sfn|Adams|1979|p=77}}

====Restricted divine command theory====

One common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between ''value'' and ''obligation''. Obligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is given a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as independent of divine commands. The result is a ''restricted'' divine command theory that applies only to a specific region of morality: the [[deontic]] region of obligation. This response is found in [[Francisco Suárez]]'s discussion of natural law and voluntarism in ''De legibus''{{sfn|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6 "Is the natural law truly a preceptive divine law?"}} and has been prominent in contemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1973}}, esp. p. 109 and {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=esp. p. 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip L. Quinn]],{{sfn|Quinn|2007|loc=esp. p. 71}} and William P. Alston.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=306–307}}

A significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness and badness, and therefore of God's own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with voluntarism can perhaps be answered. God's commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide his commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=317–318}} God could not issue horrible commands: God's own essential goodness{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}}{{sfn|Quinn|2007|pp=81–85}}{{sfn|Alston|1990|p=317}} or loving character&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1979}}. In this early work, Adams's view is that it is logically possible but "unthinkable" that God would issue horrible commands: "the believer's concepts of ethical rightness and wrongness would break down in the situation in which he believed that God commanded cruelty for its own sake" (p. 324). In later work, Adams contends that "God ''cannot'' be sadistic" ({{harvnb|Adams|1999|p=47}}).&lt;/ref&gt; would keep him from issuing any unsuitable commands. Our obligation to obey God's commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might instead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=252–253}} These proposed solutions are controversial,&lt;ref&gt;For criticisms, see {{harvnb|Chandler|1985}}; {{harvnb|Morriston|2001}}; {{harvnb|Shaw|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Zagzebski|2004|pp=259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some steer the view back into problems associated with the first horn.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} on the problems of divine omnipotence and freedom of the will&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem remains for such views: if God's own essential goodness does not depend on divine commands, then on what ''does'' it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=Chapter 1}}; {{harvnb|Quinn|2007}}; {{harvnb|Alston|1990}} distances himself from Platonism; see also {{harvnb|Kretzmann|1999|pp=375–376}} for a similar solution, put in terms of divine simplicity.&lt;/ref&gt; Alston offers the analogy of [[Metre#Prototype metre bar|the standard meter bar in France]]. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why ''God'' is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is "the end of the line," with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=318–322}} On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's ''will'', it still depends on ''God'', and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.

This solution has been criticized by [[Wes Morriston]]. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness with God's nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving, being just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: is God good because he has those properties, or are those properties good because God has them?{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=253}} Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God's essential goodness is the divine-command theorist's best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it would have to give an account of God's goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God subject to an independent standard of goodness.{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=266}}

Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], disputing the perspective that "God is good" and could never advocate something like torture, states that those who propose this are "caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Practical Ethics|edition= 3d|last= Singer|first= Peter|year= 1993|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-43971-8|pages= 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False dilemma===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], and Aquinas all wrote about the issues raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although, like [[William James]]{{sfn|James|1891}} and Wittgenstein&lt;ref name=Janik/&gt; later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm scholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are true propositions which exist as platonic [[abstract object|abstracta]] independently of God.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} Among these are propositions constituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=186}} Classical [[Judaeo-Christian]] theism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God's omnipotence, which requires that God and what he has made is all that there is.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} "The classical tradition," Rogers notes, "also steers clear of the other horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|2008|p=186}}; see also {{harvnb|Rogers|2000|pp=127–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From a classical theistic perspective, therefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, "Anselm, like Augustine before him and Aquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the moral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value."{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}}

====Jewish thought====
The basis of the false dilemma response—God's nature is the standard for value—predates the dilemma itself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[prophet]]s, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], [[Hosea]], [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] and [[Isaiah]]. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before [[Thales]], traditionally regarded as the first Greek philosopher.) "Their message," writes British scholar [[Norman H. Snaith]], "is recognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=59}}. Written over many centuries by many authors, the Old Testament displays a marked ethical evolution in its portrayal&amp;nbsp;– and therefore understanding&amp;nbsp;– of God. In its earliest-written books, God appears at times as no more than a nationalistic tribal deity who orders the extermination of entire peoples hostile to Israel, such as the [[Midianites]] (Numbers 31: 1–54) and [[Amalekites]] (1 Samuel 15: 1–25). By the time of Amos, however, such "primitive and immature notions" are a thing of the past ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|loc=p. 52; see also pp. 61–62, 66–67}}). For a recent overview, see {{harvnb|Head|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not least in its "special consideration for the poor and down-trodden."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|pp=68–69}}. It was this "bias towards the poor and needy" ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=70}}) in the message of the Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ that inspired the "[[preferential option for the poor]]" of late-twentieth-century Latin American [[liberation theology]].&lt;/ref&gt; As Snaith observes, ''tsedeq'', the Hebrew word for [[righteousness]], "actually stands for the establishment of God's will in the land." This includes justice, but goes beyond it, "because God's will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones on earth."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=70}} ''Tsedeq'' "is the norm by which all must be judged" and it "depends entirely upon the Nature of God."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}

Hebrew has few [[abstract noun]]s. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews thought of as activities.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=174}} In contrast to the Greek ''[[dikaiosyne|dikaiosune]]'' (justice) of the philosophers, ''tsedeq'' is not an idea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:
{{quote|''Tsedeq'' is something that happens here, and can be seen, and recognized, and known. It follows, therefore, that when the Hebrew thought of ''tsedeq'' (righteousness), he did not think of Righteousness in general, or of Righteousness as an Idea. On the contrary, he thought of a particular righteous act, an action, concrete, capable of exact description, fixed in time and space.... If the word had anything like a general meaning for him, then it was as it was represented by a whole series of events, the sum-total of a number of particular happenings.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}}}
The Hebrew stance on what came to be called the [[problem of universals]], as on much else, was very different from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|pp=9, 187–188}} This has not changed. In 2005, [[Jonathan Sacks]] wrote, "In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist."{{sfn|Sacks|2005|p=164}} Jewish philosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as "misleading" because "it is not exhaustive": it leaves out a third option, namely that God "acts only out of His nature."{{sfn|Sagi|Statman|1995|pp=62–63}}

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Like [[Aristotle]], Aquinas rejected Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics]'', Bk. 1, lectio 10, n. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but as more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and vagueness.{{sfn|McInerny|1982|pp=122–123}} On this analysis, the abstract "good" in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an unnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle's definition, "Good is what all desire."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' 1.1; Aquinas, ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics]'' 1, 9 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 5,1}} As he clarified, "When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 6,2 ad 2}} In other words, even those who desire evil desire it "only under the aspect of good," i.e., of what is desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics'' 1,10.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony, whereas in the latter, they are in discord.{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II q24, a2}}

Aquinas's discussion of [[sin]] provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the nature of God is the standard for value. "Every sin," he writes, "consists in the longing for a passing [i.e., ultimately unreal or false] good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I/II 72,2}} Thus, "in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no one sins with full knowledge."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II 58,2 and I/II 77,2}} "No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' 4,92.&lt;/ref&gt; God, however, has full knowledge ([[omniscience]]) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed&amp;nbsp;– for instance, by [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who wrote: "There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the same time freedom for evil"&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Nicolai. ''Ethik'' (3rd edition). Berlin, 1949, p. 378. Cited in {{harvnb|Pieper|2001|pp=78–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that this would limit God's freedom, and therefore his omnipotence. [[Josef Pieper]], however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly [[anthropomorphic]] conception of God.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer.htm De Veritate]'' 24,3 ad 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a sign, of freedom (''quodam libertatis signum'').&lt;ref name=Ver22&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 22,6.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, in other words, are not puppets manipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, "it does not belong to the [[essence]] of the free will to be able to decide for evil."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 24,3 ad 2; ''Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard'' 2d,44,1,1 ad 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom."&lt;ref name=Ver22/&gt; It is precisely humans' creatureliness&amp;nbsp;– that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient&amp;nbsp;– that makes them capable of sinning.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=80}} Consequently, writes Pieper, "the inability to sin should be looked on as the very signature of a higher freedom&amp;nbsp;– contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue."{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} Pieper concludes: "Only ''the'' will [i.e., God's] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is right necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be thinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act"{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 63,1 }}{{sfn|Pieper|2001|pp=80–81}}&amp;nbsp;– and consequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory, is also disposed of.

====William James====
William James, in his essay "[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]]", dismisses the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: "Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in themselves,' is ... either an out-and-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker ... to whom the existence of the universe is due."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}} Moral obligations are created by "personal demands," whether these demands&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gale|1999|p=44}}: In his essay, "James used 'desire', 'demand' and 'claim' interchangeably, using 'desire' and 'demand' each eleven times and 'claim' five."&lt;/ref&gt; come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from God. It follows that "ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there is a God as well." However, whether "the purely human system" works "as well as the other is a different question."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}}

For James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls "the easy-going and the strenuous mood."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood, since the thinker's "various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value;&lt;ref&gt;James is acutely aware of how hard it is to "avoid complete moral skepticism on the one hand, and on the other escape bringing a wayward personal standard of our own along with us, on which we simply pin our faith." He briefly discusses several notions "proposed as bases of the ethical system", but finds little to help choose among them. ({{harvnb|James|1891|loc=Section III}})&lt;/ref&gt; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating power." Our attitude is "entirely different" in a world where there are none but "finite demanders" from that in a world where there is also "an infinite demander." This is because "the stable and systematic moral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker with all-enveloping demands", for in that case, "actualized in his thought already must be that ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach." Even though "exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us", our postulation of him serves "to let loose in us the strenuous mood"{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} and confront us with an [[existential]]{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=40}} "challenge" in which "our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life. From this unsparing practical ordeal no professor's lectures and no array of books can save us."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In the words of Richard M. Gale, "God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving of him as unsurpassably ''good''. This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question of the ''Euthyphro''."{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=44}}

==In philosophical atheism==
===Atheistic resolutions===
[[Atheism]] challenges the assumption of the dilemma that God exists (or in the original formulation, that the many gods in Greek religion existed).  This eliminates the need to decide whether God is either non-omniscient or arbitrary, and also eliminates the possibility of God as the source of morality.

[[Secular humanism]] takes the positive stance that morality is not dependent on religion or theology, and that ethical rules should be developed based on reason, science, experience, debate, and democracy.  Some secular humanists believe in [[ethical naturalism]], that there are objective, discoverable laws of morality inherent to the human condition, of which humans may have imperfect knowledge.  Others have adopted [[moral relativism]] in the sense of [[meta-ethics]] – the idea that ethics are a [[social construct]] – but nonetheless by way of [[utilitarianism]] advocate imposing a set of [[moral universalism|universal ethics]] and laws that create the type of society in which they wish to live, where people are safe, prosperous, and happy.  These competing resolutions represent different answers to a question similar to the original dilemma: "Is something inherently ethical or unethical, or is something ethical or unethical because a person or society says it is so?"

===Rejection of universal morality===
The other assumption of the dilemma is that there is a universal right and wrong, against which a god either creates or is defined by.  [[Moral nihilism]] challenges that assumption by rejecting the concept of morality entirely.  This conflicts with the teachings of most religions (and thus is usually accompanied by atheism) but is theoretically compatible with the notion of a powerful God or gods who have opinions about how people should behave.

[[Moral relativism]] accepts the idea of morality, but asserts that there are multiple potential arbiters of moral truth.  This opens the possibility of disagreeing with God about the rules of ethics, and of creating multiple societies with different, equally valid sets of ethics (just as different countries have different sets of laws).  "Normative moral relativism" asserts that behavior based on alternative systems of morality should be tolerated. In the context of [[religious pluralism]], strong [[relativism]] it also opens the possibility that different gods and different belief systems produce different but equally valid moral systems, which may apply only to adherents of those faiths.

==In popular culture==
In the song "[[No Church in the Wild]]" from the album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'', rapper [[Jay Z]] references the dilemma with the line, "Is pious pious 'cause God loves pious? [[Socrates]] asked whose bias do y'all seek."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-no-church-in-the-wild-lyrics#note-314340|title=Kanye West – No Church in the Wild Lyrics|accessdate = 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In American legal thinking==

[[Yale Law School]] Professor [[Myres S. McDougal]], formerly a classicist, later a scholar of property law, posed the question, "Do we protect it because it's a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Richard H. Stern]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ScopeProtnProb.pdf  ''Scope-of-Protection Problems With Patents and Copyrights on Methods of Doing Business''], 10 {{smcaps|Fordham Intell. Prop., Media &amp; Ent.}} L.J. 105, 128 n.100 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]'', 324 U.S. 499 (1945), Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] addressed whether there was a protectable property interest in a head of water lessened by federal action. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]ot all economic interests are "property rights;" only those economic advantages are "rights" which have the law back of them, and only when they are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with them or to compensate for their invasion. ... We cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here a "property right;" whether it is a property right is really the question to be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally protected interests.&lt;ref&gt;324 U.S. at 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's majority (per Justice Jackson) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. A dissenting opinion, however, considered that property rights existed ''a priori'' and that they dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.

{{short description|System of morality in Buddhism}}
{{LayBuddhistPractices}}
The '''five precepts''' ({{lang-pi|italic=yes|pañcasīla}}; {{lang-sa|italic=yes|pañcaśīla}}) or '''five rules of training''' ({{lang-pi|pañcasikkhapada|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|pañcaśikṣapada|italic=yes}}{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}){{refn |group=note |Also spelled as ''pañcasīlani'' and ''pañcasikkhāpadani'', respectively.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}}}} is the most important system of morality for [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|Buddhist lay people]]. They constitute the basic code of [[Buddhist ethics|ethics]] undertaken by lay followers of Buddhism. The precepts are commitments to abstain from killing [[sentient being (Buddhism)|living beings]], stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication. Within the Buddhist doctrine, they are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. They are sometimes referred to as the '''''[[śrāvakayāna]] precepts''''' in the [[Mahāyāna]] tradition, contrasting them with the [[bodhisattva Precepts|''bodhisattva'' precepts]]. The five precepts form the basis of several parts of Buddhist doctrine, both lay and monastic. With regard to their fundamental role in Buddhist ethics, they have been compared with the [[ten commandments]] in Christianity{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=638}}{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=4}} or the [[li (Confucianism)|ethical codes]] of [[Confucianism]]. The precepts have been connected with [[utilitarianist]], [[deontological]] and [[virtue ethics|virtue]] approaches to ethics. They have been compared with human rights because of their universal nature, and some scholars argue they can complement the concept of human rights.

The five precepts were common to the religious milieu of 6th-century BCE India, but the Buddha's focus on [[Appamada|awareness]] through the fifth precept was unique. As shown in [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the precepts grew to be more important, and finally became a condition for membership of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries where Buddhism had to compete with other religions, such as China, the ritual of undertaking the five precepts developed into an initiation ceremony to become a Buddhist lay person. On the other hand, in countries with little competition from other religions, such as Thailand, the ceremony has had little relation to the rite of becoming Buddhist, as many people are presumed Buddhist from birth.

Undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}). The [[Pali Canon]] recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others. Compassion and a belief in [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic retribution]] form the foundation of the precepts. Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple. However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time. People keep them with an intention to develop themselves, but also out of fear of a [[Buddhist cosmology|bad rebirth]].

The first precept consists of a prohibition of killing, both humans and all animals. Scholars have interpreted Buddhist texts about the precepts as an opposition to and prohibition of capital punishment,{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=236{{en dash}}7}} suicide, abortion{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=213}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=110}} and euthanasia.{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} In practice, however, many Buddhist countries still use the death penalty. With regard to abortion, Buddhist countries take the middle ground, by condemning though not prohibiting it. The Buddhist attitude to violence is generally interpreted as opposing all warfare, but some scholars have raised exceptions. The second precept prohibits theft. The third precept refers to adultery in all its forms, and has been defined by modern teachers with terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''. The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action, as well as malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip. The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Early Buddhist Texts nearly always condemn alcohol, and so do Chinese Buddhist post-canonical texts. Buddhist attitudes toward smoking differ per time and region, but are generally permissive. In modern times, traditional Buddhist countries have seen revival movements to promote the five precepts. As for the West, the precepts play a major role in Buddhist organizations. They have also been integrated in [[mindfulness]] training programs, though many mindfulness specialists do not support this because of the precepts' religious import. Lastly, many conflict prevention programs make use of the precepts.

== Role in Buddhist doctrine ==
Buddhist scriptures explain the five precepts as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality.{{sfn |Gowans |2013 |page=440}} It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the [[Patimokkha|monastic rules]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodman |first1=Charles |title=Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708233552/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-date=8 July 2010 |dead-url=no |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]] |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Śīla]]'' (Sanskrit; {{lang-pi|sīla|italic=yes}}) is used to refer to Buddhist precepts,{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}} including the five.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}} But the word also refers to the virtue and morality which lies at the foundation of the spiritual path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], which is the first of the [[Three Trainings|three forms of training]] on the path. Thus, the precepts are rules or guidelines to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}} The five precepts are part of the right speech, action and livelihood aspects of the [[eight-fold path]], the core teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn|Powers |2013 |loc=āryāṣtāṅga-mārga }}{{refn |group=note |The fifth precept has also been connected with [[right mindfulness]].{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}}}} Moreover, the practice of the five precepts and other parts of ''śīla'' are described as forms of [[merit-making]], means to create good [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]].{{sfn |Osto |2015}}{{sfn |McFarlane |1997}} The five precepts have been described as [[value (ethics)|social values]] that bring harmony to society,{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=79 }} and breaches of the precepts described as antithetical to a harmonious society.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |page=31}} On a smilar note, in Buddhist texts, the ideal, righteous society is one in which people keep five precepts.{{sfn |Tambiah |1992 |page=121}}
[[File:Dharmachakra, withprint (en).svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The [[eight-fold path]], of which the five precepts are part.|alt=Wheel with eight spokes, with the different aspects of the Buddhist eight-fold written on them]]
Comparing different parts of Buddhist doctrine, the five precepts form the basis of the eight precepts, which are lay precepts stricter than the five precepts, similar to monastic precepts.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} Secondly, the five precepts form the first half of the [[bodhisattva Precepts|ten or eleven precepts]] for a [[bodhisattva|person aiming to become a Buddha]] (''[[bodhisattva]]''), as mentioned in the ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sūtra]]'' of the Mahāyāna tradition.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn|Cozort |Shields |2018 |loc=Dōgen, The Bodhisattva Path according to the ''Ugra'' }}{{sfn |Funayama |2004 |page=98}} Contrasting these precepts with the five precepts, the latter were commonly referred to by Mahāyānists as the ''[[śrāvakayāna]]'' precepts, or the precepts of those aiming to become [[arhat|enlightened disciples]] of a Buddha, but not [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] themselves. The ten{{en dash}}eleven ''bodhisattva'' precepts presuppose the five precepts, and are partly based on them.{{sfn |Funayama|2004 |page=105}} The five precepts are also partly found in the teaching called the ten good courses of action, referred to in [[Theravāda]] ({{lang-pi|dasa-kusala-kammapatha|italic=yes}}) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ({{lang-sa |daśa-kuśala-karmapatha |italic=yes }}; {{bo|w=dge ba bcu|italic=yes}}).&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;{{sfn |Keown |2005 |loc=Precepts}} Finally, the first four of the five precepts are very similar to the [[parajika|most fundamental rules of monastic discipline]], and may have influenced their development.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}

In conclusion, the five precept lie at the foundation of all Buddhist practice, and in that respect, can be compared with the [[ten commandments]] in Christianity{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=638}}{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=4}} or the [[li (Confucianism)|ethical codes]] of [[Confucianism]].{{sfn |Funayama |2004 |page=98}}

== History ==
[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb |In [[Tang Dynasty|8th-century China]], people held strict attitudes about abstinence of alcohol. |alt=Map marking part of China]]
The five precepts were part of [[early Buddhism]] and are common to nearly all schools of Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=210 }} In early Buddhism, the five precepts were regarded as an ethic of restraint, to restrain unwholesome tendencies and thereby purify one's being to attain enlightenment.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |page=178}}{{sfn|Cozort |Shields |2018 |loc=Precepts in Early and Theravāda Buddhism}} The five precepts were based on the ''pañcaśīla'', prohibitions for pre-Buddhist [[Brahmanic]] priests, which were adopted in many Indic religions around 6th century BCE.{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=78 }}{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=171, 173}} The first four Buddhist precepts were nearly identical to these ''pañcaśīla'', but the fifth precept, the prohibition on intoxication, was new in Buddhism:{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}{{refn |group=note |The 6th century CE [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chāndogya Upaniśad]] contains four principles identical to the Buddhist precepts, but lying is not mentioned.{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=58}} In contemporary [[Jainism]], the fifth principle became "appropriation of any sort".{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}}} the Buddha's emphasis on [[appamada|awareness]] ({{lang-pi|appamāda|italic=yes |links=no}}) was unique.{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=78 }}

In some schools of ancient Indic Buddhism, Buddhist devotees could choose to adhere to only a number of precepts, instead of the complete five. The schools that would survive in later periods, however, that is Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhism, were both ambiguous about this practice. Some early Mahāyāna texts allow it, but some do not; [[Pāli Canon|Theravāda texts]] do not discuss this practice at all.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=83}}

The prohibition on killing has motivated [[early Buddhism|early Buddhists]] to form a stance against animal sacrifice, a common ritual practice in ancient India.&lt;ref name="World Religions" /&gt;{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=273}} According to the Pāli Canon, however, early Buddhists did not adopt a vegetarian lifestyle.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=273}}

In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the role of the five precepts gradually develops. First of all, the precepts are combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, [[dhamma|his teaching]] and [[sangha|the monastic community]]).&lt;!--173--&gt; Next, the precepts develop to become the foundation of lay practice.&lt;!--173-4--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pp=173{{en dash}}4}} The precepts are seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}} At a third stage in the texts, the precepts are actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they are part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, become a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people have to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |p=173}} When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9, 205}}

In China, the five precepts were introduced in the first centuries CE,&lt;!--171, 176--&gt; both in their ''śrāvakayāna'' and ''bodhisattva'' formats.&lt;!--175--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=171, 175{{en dash}}6}} During this time, it was particularly Buddhist teachers who promoted abstinence from alcohol (the fifth precept), since [[Daoism]] and other thought systems emphasized moderation rather than full abstinence. Chinese Buddhists interpreted the fifth precept strictly,&lt;!--p=223--&gt; even more so than in Indic Buddhism.&lt;!--p=226--&gt; For example, the monk [[Daoshi (Buddhist monk)|Daoshi]] ({{circa}} 600–83) dedicated large sections of [[Fayuan Zhulin|his encyclopedic writings]] to abstinence from alcohol.&lt;!--p=224--&gt; However, in some parts of China, such as [[Dunhuang]], considerable evidence has been found of alcohol consumption among both lay people and monastics.&lt;!--p=230--&gt; Later, from the 8th century onward, strict attitudes of abstinence led to a development of a distinct [[Chinese tea culture|tea culture]] among Chinese monastics and lay intellectuals, in which tea gatherings replaced gatherings with alcoholic beverages, and were advocated as such.&lt;!--214, 231--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=214, 223{{en dash}}4, 226, 230{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}} These strict attitudes were formed partly because of the religious writings, but may also have been affected by the bloody [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 775, which had a sobering effect on [[Tang dynasty|8th-century Chinese society]].{{sfn |Benn |2005 |page=231}} When the five precepts were integrated in Chinese society, they were associated and connected with karma,&lt;!--178--&gt; [[Wu Xing|Chinese cosmology]]&lt;!--176-7--&gt; and [[Chinese medicine|medicine]],&lt;!--184--&gt; a Daoist worldview,&lt;!--178--&gt; and [[Confucianism#Social morality and ethics|Confucian virtue ethics]].&lt;!--185--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=176{{en dash}}8, 184{{en dash}}5}}

== Ceremonies ==
=== In Pāli tradition ===
[[File:Buddhist monks giving a teaching or blessing to lay people.jpg|thumb|In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts.|alt=Asian person holding hands in prayer, facing two monks in brown robes.]]
In the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are recited in a standardized fashion, using [[Pāli language]]. In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts by reciting the following three times:

{{blockquote |"Venerables, we request the five precepts and the [[three refuges]] [i.e. the triple gem] for the sake of observing them, one by one, separately". ({{lang|pi |Mayaṃ bhante visuṃ visuṃ rakkhaṇatthāya tisaraṇena saha pañca sīlāniyācāma.}}){{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=179{{en dash}}80}}}}

After this, the monk administering the precepts will recite a reverential line of text to introduce the ceremony, after which he guides the lay people in declaring that they take their refuge in the three refuges or triple gem.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=181}}

He then continues with reciting the five precepts:{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=67}}{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from onslaught on breathing beings." ({{lang-pi |Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from taking what is not given." ({{lang-pi |Adinnādānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from misconduct concerning sense-pleasures." ({{lang-pi |Kāmesumicchācāra veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from false speech." ({{lang-pi |Musāvādā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from alcoholic drink or drugs that are an opportunity for heedlessness." ({{lang-pi |Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes }})

In the fifth precept ''[[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|sura]]'', ''meraya'' and ''majja'' are kinds of alcoholic beverages. In some modern translations, ''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā'', is rendered more broadly, variously, as, ''intoxicants'' or ''liquor and drugs'', etc.&lt;!--not sourced, but not contentious--&gt;

After the lay people have repeated the five precepts after the monk, the monk will close the ceremony reciting:

{{blockquote |"These five precepts lead with good behavior to bliss, with good behavior to wealth and success, they lead with good behavior to happiness, therefore purify behavior." ({{lang|pi |Imāni pañca sikkhāpadāni. Sīlena sugatiṃ yanti, sīlena bhogasampadā, sīlena nibbutiṃ yanti, tasmā sīlaṃ visodhaye.}}){{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=182}}}}

One formula of the precepts can be found in the ''Treatise on Taking Refuge and the Precepts'' ({{zh|s=归戒要集|t=歸戒要集|p=Guījiè Yāojí}}):

# As all Buddhas refrained from killing until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from killing until the end of my life.

Similarly, in the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] texts used in Tibetan Buddhism, the precepts are formulated such that one takes the precepts upon oneself for one's entire lifespan, following the examples of the enlightened disciples of the Buddha (''[[arahant]]'').{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=67 }}

The five precepts can be found in many places in the Early Buddhist Texts.{{sfn |Tedesco |2004 |p=91 }} The precepts are regarded as means to building good character, or as an expression of such character. The Pāli Canon describes them as means to avoid harm to oneself and others.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2017|page=2}} It further describes them as gifts toward oneself and others.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=66 }} Moreover, the texts say that people who uphold them will be confident in any gathering of people,&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=63}} will have wealth and a good reputation, and will die a peaceful death, reborn in heaven{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=67 }}{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=63}} or as a [[Human beings in Buddhism|human being]]. On the other hand, living a life in violation of the precepts is believed to lead to rebirth in an [[Naraka (Buddhism)|unhappy destination]].&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; They are understood as principles that define a person as human in body and mind.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |page=2}}

The precepts are normative rules, but are formulated and understood as "undertakings"{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=66 }} rather than commandments enforced by a moral authority,{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=268 }}{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }} according to the voluntary and [[gradualism#Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies|gradualist]] standards of Buddhist ethics.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}} They are forms of restraint formulated in negative terms, but are also accompanied by virtues and positive behaviors,{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} which are cultivated through the practice of the precepts.{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}}{{refn |This dual meaning in negative formulations is typical for an Indic language like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn |Keown |1998 |pages=399{{en dash}}400}}|group=note}} The most important of these virtues is [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}),&lt;ref name="World Religions"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ahiṃsā |date=1997 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |encyclopedia=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |via=Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/ahimsa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071832/https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/ahimsa |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=616}} which underlies all of the five precepts.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{refn |group=note |However, anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] argued that the fundamental virtue behind the precepts was [[mettā|loving-kindness]], not "the Hindu notion of non-violence".{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}}}} Precisely, the texts say that one should keep the precepts, adhering to the principle of comparing oneself with others:{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pages=33, 71 }}
{{blockquote|"For a state that is not pleasant or delightful to me must be so to him also; and a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me, how could I inflict that upon another?"{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=33 }}}}

In other words, all living beings are alike in that they want to be happy and not suffer. Comparing oneself with others, one should therefore not hurt others as one would not want to be hurt.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=120}} Ethicist Pinit Ratanakul argues that the compassion which motivates upholding the precepts comes from an understanding that all living beings are equal and of a nature that they are '[[anatman|not-self]]' ({{lang-pi|anattā|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=241 }} Another aspect that is fundamental to this is the belief in karmic retribution.{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=276}}
[[File:Amber.pendants.800pix.050203.jpg|thumb|upright=.8 |A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen". |alt=Two pendants of amber]]
In the upholding or violation of the precepts, [[cetana|intention]] is crucial.{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}}{{sfn |Keown |1998 |page=386}} In the Pāli scriptures, an example is mentioned of a person stealing an animal only to [[life release|set it free]], which was not seen as an [[parajika|offense of theft]].{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}} In the Pāli [[atthakatha|commentaries]], a precept is understood to be violated when the person violating it finds the object of the transgression (e.g. things to be stolen), is aware of the violation, has the intention to violate it, does actually act on that intention, and does so successfully.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}

Upholding the precepts is sometimes distinguished in three levels: to uphold them without having formally undertaken them; to uphold them formally, willing to sacrifice one's own life for it; and finally, to spontaneously uphold them.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=141 }} The latter refers to the ''arahant'', who is understood to be morally incapable of violating the first four precepts.{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=1}} A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen".{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=63 }} On the other hand, the most serious violations of the precepts are the [[Anantarika-karma|five actions of immediate retribution]], which are believed to lead the perpetrator to an unavoidable rebirth in [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]]. These consist of injuring a Buddha, killing an ''arahant'', killing one's father or mother, and causing the monastic community to have a schism.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}

== Practice in general ==
Lay followers often undertake these training rules in the same ceremony as they [[taking refuge|take the refuges]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Festivals and Calendrical Rituals |date=2004 |publisher=[[The Gale Group]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/festivals-and-calendrical-rituals |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE0BBbB |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Buddhist lay people may recite the precepts regularly at home, and before an important ceremony at the temple to prepare the mind for the ceremony.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}}
[[File:Thich Nhat Hanh 12.jpg|thumb |left |upright=.5 |[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations.|alt=Asian monk smiling]]
The five precepts are at the core of Buddhist morality.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}} In field studies in some countries like Sri Lanka, villagers describe them as the core of the religion.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Anthropologist {{ill |Barend Terwiel|de|Barend Jan Terwiel}} found in his fieldwork that most Thai villagers knew the precepts by heart, and many, especially the elderly, could explain the implications of the precepts following traditional interpretations.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}

Nevertheless, Buddhists do not all follow them with the same strictness.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}} Devotees who have just started keeping the precepts will typically have to exercise considerable restraint. When they become used to the precepts, they start to embody them more naturally.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2017|page=10}} Researchers doing field studies in traditional Buddhist societies have found that the five precepts are generally considered demanding and challenging.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=286 }} For example, in a 1997 survey in Thailand, only 13.8% of the respondents indicated they adhered to the five precepts in their daily lives, with the fourth and fifth precept least likely to be adhered to.{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2009 |page=193}} Yet, people do consider the precepts worth striving for, and do uphold them out of fear of bad karma and being reborn in [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]], or because they believe in that the Buddha issued these rules, and that they therefore should be maintained.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=188}}{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=449}} Anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] found that Burmese Buddhists mostly upheld the precepts to avoid bad karma, as opposed to expecting to gain good karma.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |pp=99, 102}} Religion scholar Winston King observed from his field studies that the moral principles of Burmese Buddhists were based on personal self-developmental motives rather than other-regarding motives. Religion scholar Richard Jones concludes that the moral motives of Buddhists in adhering to the precepts are based on the idea that renouncing self-service, ironically, serves oneself.{{sfn |Jones |1979 |p=374}}

In East Asian Buddhism, the precepts are intrinsically connected with the initiation as a Buddhist lay person.&lt;!--81--&gt; Early Chinese translations such as the ''Upāsaka-śila Sūtra'' hold that the precepts should only be ritually transmitted by a monastic.&lt;!--80--&gt; The texts describe that in the ritual the power of the Buddhas and ''bodhisattvas'' is transmitted, and helps the initiate to keep the precepts.&lt;!--81--&gt; This "lay ordination" ritual usually occurs after a stay in a temple, and often after a [[upasampada|monastic ordination]] has taken place. The ordained lay person is then given a [[Dharma name|religious name]]. The restrictions that apply are similar to a monastic ordination, such as permission from parents.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=80{{en dash}}1}}

In the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are usually taken "each separately" ({{lang-pi|visuṃ visuṃ|italic=yes|link=no}}), to indicate that if one precept should be broken, the other precepts are still intact. In very solemn occasions, or for very pious devotees, the precepts may be taken as a group rather than each separately.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=82}}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=180}} This does not mean, however, that only some of the precepts can be undertaken; they are always committed to as a complete set.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=82{{en dash}}3}} In East Asian Buddhism, however, the vow of taking the precepts is considered a solemn matter, and it is not uncommon for lay people to undertake only the precepts that they are confident they can keep.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=83}} The act of taking a vow to keep the precepts is what makes it karmically effective: Spiro found that someone who did not violate the precepts, but did not have any intention to keep them either, was not believed to accrue any religious merit. On the other hand, when people took a vow to keep the precepts, and then broke them afterwards, the negative karma was considered larger as in the case no vow was taken to keep the precepts.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=217}}

Several modern teachers such as [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] and [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] have written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations. In these perspectives, mass production of weapons or spreading untruth through media and education also violate the precepts.{{sfn |Queen |2013 |page=532}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Engaged Buddhism |date=2005 |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/engaged-buddhism |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE9MCNL |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, human rights organizations in Southeast Asia have attempted to advocate respect for human rights by referring to the five precepts as guiding principles.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=154}}

== First precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Haft.jpg|thumb|The first of the five precepts includes abstention from killing small animals such as insects.|alt=Mayfly on human finger]]
The first precept prohibits the taking of life of a [[sentient being (Buddhism)|sentient being]]. It is violated when someone intentionally and successfully kills such a sentient being, having understood it to be sentient and using effort in the process.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml|title={{nowrap|Religions - }}Buddhism: Abortion|website=[[BBC]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071851/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml|archive-date=24 August 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causing injury goes against the spirit of the precept, but does, technically speaking, not violate it.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} The first precept includes taking the lives of animals, even small insects.&lt;!--p=271--&gt; However, it has also been pointed out that the seriousness of taking life depends on the size, intelligence, benefits done&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; and the spiritual attainments of that living being. Killing a large animal is worse than killing a small animal&lt;!--272--&gt;&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; (also because it costs more effort); killing a spiritually accomplished master is regarded as more severe than the killing of another "more average" human being;&lt;!--p=272--&gt; and killing a human being is more severe than the killing an animal.&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; But all killing is condemned.&lt;!--p=272--&gt;{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|pages=271–2}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=156}} Virtues that accompany this precept are respect for dignity of life,{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=616}} [[metta|kindness]] and [[karuṇā|compassion]],{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} the latter expressed as "trembling for the welfare of others".{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} A positive behavior that goes together with this precept is protecting living beings.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Positive virtues like sympathy and respect for other living beings in this regard are based on a belief in the [[samsara|cycle of rebirth]]{{em dash}}that all living beings must be born and reborn.{{sfn |Wai|2002|p=293}} The concept of the fundamental [[Buddha nature]] of all human beings also underlies the first precept.{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=275}}

Ordering another person to kill is also included in this precept,{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} therefore requesting or administering euthanasia can be considered a violation of the precept,{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} as well as advising another person to commit abortion.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=314}} With regard to [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], Keown quotes the Pāli ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'' that says a person upholding the first precept "does not kill a living being, does not cause a living being to be killed, does not approve of the killing of a living being".{{sfn |Keown |1998 |p=400}} Keown argues that in Buddhist ethics, regardless of motives, death can never be the aim of one's actions.{{sfn |Keown |1998 |p=402}}

Interpretations of how Buddhist texts regard warfare are varied, but in general Buddhist doctrine is considered to oppose all warfare. In many ''Jātaka'' tales, such as that of [[Adhiṭṭhāna#Temiya the Wise|Prince Temiya]], as well as some historical documents, the virtue of non-violence is taken as an opposition to all war, both offensive and defensive.&lt;!--51-2--&gt; At the same time, though, the Buddha is often shown not to explicitly oppose war in his conversations with political figures. Buddhologist [[André Bareau]] points out that the Buddha was reserved in his involvement of the details of administrative policy, and concentrated on the moral and spiritual development of his disciples instead.&lt;!--50--&gt; He may have believed such involvement to be futile, or detrimental to Buddhism.&lt;!--51--&gt; Nevertheless, at least one disciple of the Buddha is mentioned in the texts who refrained from retaliating his enemies because of the Buddha, that is King [[Pasenadi]] ({{lang-sa|Prasenajit|link=no}}). The texts are ambiguous in explaining his motives though.&lt;!--51--&gt;{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=50{{en dash}}2}} In some later Mahāyāna texts, such as in the writings of [[Asaṅga]], examples are mentioned of people who kill those who persecute Buddhists.{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=57{{en dash}}59}}{{sfn |Jones |1979 |p=380}} In these examples, killing is justified by the authors because protecting Buddhism was seen as more important than keeping the precepts.&lt;!--380--&gt; Another example that is often cited is that of King [[Dutthagamani|Duṭṭhagāmaṇī]], who is mentioned in the post-canonical Pāli [[Mahavamsa|Mahāvaṃsa]] chronicle. In the chronicle, the king is saddened with the loss of life after a war, but comforted by a Buddhist monk, who states that nearly everyone who was killed did not uphold the precepts anyway.&lt;!--385--&gt;{{sfn |Jones |1979 |pp=380, 385 n.2}}{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=56{{en dash}}7}} Buddhist studies scholar [[Lambert Schmithausen]] argues that in many of these cases Buddhist teachings like that of [[emptiness (Buddhism)|emptiness]] were misused to further an agenda of war or other violence.{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=60{{en dash}}2}}

[[File:Vegmark.PNG|thumb|In Buddhism, there are different opinions about whether vegetarianism should be practiced.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} |alt=Signals used to indicate vegetarian or non-vegetarian food]]
Field studies in Cambodia and Burma have shown that many Buddhists considered the first precept the most important, or the most blamable.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} In some traditional communities, such as in [[Kandal Province]] in pre-war Cambodia, as well as Burma in the 1980s, it was uncommon for Buddhists to slaughter animals, to the extent that meat had to be bought from not-Buddhists.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}} In his field studies in Thailand in the 1960s, Terwiel found that villagers did tend to kill insects, but were reluctant and self-conflicted with regard to killing larger animals.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=186}} In Spiro's field studies, however, Burmese villagers were highly reluctant even to kill insects.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}}

Early Buddhists did not adopt a [[vegetarianism in Buddhism|vegetarian lifestyle]].&lt;!--cited above--&gt; Indeed, in several Pāli [[sutra|texts]] vegetarianism is described as irrelevant in the spiritual purification of the mind. There are prohibitions on certain types of meat, however, especially those which are condemned by society.&lt;!--p=274--&gt; The idea of abstaining from killing animal life has also led to a prohibition on professions that involve trade in flesh or living beings, but not to a full prohibition of all agriculture that involves cattle.&lt;!--p=276--&gt;{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|pages=273–4, 276}} In modern times, referring to the [[law of supply and demand]] or other principles, some Theravādin Buddhists have attempted to promote vegetarianism as part of the five precepts. For example, the Thai [[Santi Asoke]] movement practices vegetarianism.{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }}{{sfn |Swearer |2010 |page=177}}

Furthermore, among some schools of Buddhism, there has been some debate with regard to a principle in the monastic discipline. This principle states that a Buddhist monk cannot accept meat if it comes from animals especially slaughtered for him. Some teachers have interpreted this to mean that when the recipient has no knowledge on whether the animal has been killed for him, he cannot accept the food either. Similarly, there has been debate as to whether laypeople should be vegetarian when adhering to the five precepts.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} Though vegetarianism among Theravādins is generally uncommon, it has been practiced much in East Asian countries,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} as some Mahāyāna texts, such as the ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahāparanirvana Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'', condemn the eating of meat.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Kieschnick |2005 |page=196}} Nevertheless, even among Mahāyāna Buddhists{{em dash}}and East Asian Buddhists{{em dash}}there is disagreement on whether vegetarianism should be practiced. In the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', biological, social and hygienic reasons are given for a vegetarian diet; however, historically, a major factor in the development of a vegetarian lifestyle among Mahāyāna communities may have been that Mahāyāna monastics cultivated their own crops for food, rather than living from [[alms#Buddhism|alms]].{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=Ahiṃsa and Samādhi}} Already from the 4th century CE, Chinese writer [[Xi Chao]] understood the five precepts to include vegetarianism.{{sfn |Kieschnick |2005 |page=196}}

[[File:Dalai Lama 1430 Luca Galuzzi 2007crop.jpg|thumb |upright=.6 |The [[Dalai Lama]] has rejected forms of protest that are self-harming.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}|alt=The Dalai Lama]]
Apart from trade in flesh or living beings, there are also other professions considered undesirable. Vietnamese teacher Thich Nhat Hanh gives a list of examples, such as working in the arms industry, the military, police, producing or selling poison or drugs such as alcohol and tobacco.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=341 }}

In general, the first precept has been interpreted by Buddhists as a call for non-violence and pacifism. But there have been some exceptions of people who did not interpret the first precept as an opposition to war. For example, in the twentieth century, some Japanese Zen teachers wrote in support of violence in war, and some of them argued this should be seen as a means to uphold the first precept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title={{nowrap|Religions - }}Buddhism: War |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071857/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate and controversy surrounding the problem whether a person can commit suicide, such as [[self-immolation]], to reduce other people's suffering in the long run, such as in protest to improve a political situation in a country. Teachers like the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Lu Sheng-Yen|Shengyan]] have rejected forms of protest like self-immolation, as well as other acts of self-harming or fasting as forms of protest.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}

Although capital punishment goes against the first precept, as of 2001, many countries in Asia still maintained the death penalty, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Taiwan.&lt;!--239-41--&gt; In some Buddhist countries, such as Sri Lanka and Thailand, capital punishment was applied during some periods, while during other periods no capital punishment was used at all.&lt;!--239--&gt; In other countries with Buddhism, like China and Taiwan, Buddhism, or any religion for that matter, has had no influence in policy decisions of the government.&lt;!--240-1--&gt; Countries with Buddhism that have abolished capital punishment include Cambodia and Hong Kong.&lt;!--244 n.1--&gt;{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=239{{en dash}}41, 244 n.1}}

In general, Buddhist traditions oppose abortion.{{sfn |Agostini |2004 |pages=77{{en dash}}8}} In many countries with Buddhist traditions such as Thailand, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, however, abortion is a widespread practice, whether legal or not.&lt;!--101--&gt; Many people in these countries consider abortion immoral, but also think it should be less prohibited. Ethicist Roy W. Perrett, following Ratanakul, argues that this field research data does not so much indicate hypocrisy, but rather points at a "middle way" in applying Buddhist doctrine to solve a [[moral dilemma]]. Buddhists tend to take "both sides" on the pro-life{{en dash}}pro-choice debate, being against the taking of life of a fetus in principle, but also believing in compassion toward mothers. Similar attitudes may explain the Japanese ''[[mizuko kuyō]]'' ceremony, a Buddhist memorial service for aborted children,&lt;!--102--&gt; which has led to a debate in Japanese society concerning abortion, and finally brought the Japanese to a consensus that abortion should not be taken lightly, though it should be legalized.&lt;!--103, 109--&gt; This position, held by Japanese Buddhists, takes the middle ground between the Japanese [[Shinto#Post-war|neo-Shinto]] "pro-life" position, and the [[Sex-positive feminism|liberationist]], "pro-choice" arguments.{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |pages=101{{en dash}}3, 109}} Keown points out, however, that this compromise does not mean a Buddhist [[middle way]] between two extremes, but rather incorporates two opposite perspectives.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=205}} In Thailand, women who wish to have abortion usually do so in the early stages of pregnancy, because they believe the karmic consequences are less then. Having had abortion, Thai women usually make merits to compensate for the negative karma.{{sfn |Ratanakul |1998 |p=57}}

== Second precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Bribe.png|thumb|alt=One hand giving money to another hand, held behind a back.|Studies discovered that people who did not adhere to the five precepts more often tended to pay bribes.]]
The second precept prohibits theft, and involves the intention to steal what one perceives as not belonging to oneself ("what is not given") and acting successfully upon that intention. The severity of the act of theft is judged by the worth of the owner and the worth of that which is stolen. Underhand dealings, fraud, cheating and forgery are also included in this precept.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=70}} Accompanying virtues are [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]], [[nekkhamma|renunciation]],{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} and [[right livelihood]],{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} and a positive behavior is the protection of other people's property.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}

The second precept includes different ways of stealing and fraud. Borrowing without permission is sometimes included,{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}} as well as gambling.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=253 }} Psychologist Vanchai Ariyabuddhiphongs did studies in the 2000s and 2010s in Thailand and discovered that people who did not adhere to the five precepts more often tended to believe that money was the most important goal in life, and would more often pay bribes than people who did adhere to the precepts.{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |Hongladarom |2011 |pages=338{{en dash}}9}}{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2007 |page=43}} On the other hand, people who observed the five precepts regarded themselves as wealthier and happier than people who did not observe the precepts.{{sfn |Jaiwong |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2010 |page=337}}

Professions that are seen to violate the second precept include working in the gambling industry or marketing products that are not actually required for the customer.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}

== Third precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
The third precept condemns adultery with women that are "claimed" or "acquired", or, in other words, it condemns "going with the wife of another". The precept also includes women who are engaged with another man, young women that are still "protected by any relative", and women who are prostitutes. Moreover, rape and incest are also breaches of this precept.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} In later texts, details such as intercourse at an inappropriate time or inappropriate place are also counted as breaches of the third precept.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=73}} Masturbation goes against the spirit of the precept, though in the early texts it is not prohibited for laypeople.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=72}}

The third precept is explained as leading to greed in oneself and harm to others. The transgression is regarded as more severe if the other person is a good person.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=72}} Virtues that go hand-in-hand with the third precept are contentment, especially with one's partner,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} and recognition and respect for faithfulness in a marriage.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}

The third precept is interpreted as avoiding to harm another by using sensuality in the wrong way. This means not engaging with inappropriate partners, but also respecting one's personal commitment to a relationship.{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }} In some traditions, the precept also condemns adultery with a woman when her husband agrees with the act, since the nature of the act itself is condemned.&lt;!--only Harvey--&gt; Furthermore, flirting with a married woman may also be regarded as a violation.&lt;!--both--&gt;{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} Though prostitution is discouraged in the third precept, it is usually not actively prohibited by Buddhist teachers.{{sfn |Derks |1998}} With regard to applications of the principles of the third precept, the precept, or any Buddhist principle for that matter, is usually not connected with a stance against contraception.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eugenics and Religious Law: IV.

In the interpretation of modern teachers, the precept includes any person in a sexual relationship with another person, as they define the precept by terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} Some modern teachers include masturbation as a violation of the precept,{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} others include certain professions, such as those that involve sexual exploitation, prostitution or pornography, and professions that promote unhealthy sexual behavior, such as in the entertainment industry.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}

== Fourth precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Woman working behind computer.jpg|thumb|alt=Woman working behind computer.|thumb |Work that involves online scams can also be included as a violation of the fourth precept.]]

The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }} Avoiding other forms of wrong speech are also considered part of this precept, consisting of malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip.{{sfn |Segall |2003 |page=169}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=74, 76}} A breach of the precept is considered more serious if the falsehood is motivated by an ulterior motive{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }} (rather than, for example, "a small white lie").{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=75}} The accompanying virtue is [[Sacca#Truth as an ethical practice|being honest]] and dependable,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} and involves honesty in work, truthfulness to others, loyalty to superiors and gratitude to benefactors.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} In Buddhist texts, this precept is considered most important next to the first precept, because a lying person is regarded to have no shame, and therefore capable of many wrongs.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} Untruthfulness is not only to be avoided because it harms others, but also because it goes against the Buddhist ideal of finding the [[truth in Buddhism|truth]].{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=75}}{{sfn |Wai |2002|p=295}}

=== In practice ===
The fourth precept includes avoidance of lying and harmful speech.{{sfn|Powers |2013 |loc=pañca-śīla }} Some modern teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh interpret this to include avoiding spreading false news and uncertain information.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} Work that involves data manipulation, false advertising or online scams can also be regarded as violations.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }} Terwiel reports that among Thai Buddhists, the fourth precept is also seen to be broken when people insinuate, exaggerate or speak abusively or deceitfully.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}

== Fifth precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|thumb|The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}|alt=Glass of red wine |upright=.3]]
The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means, and its virtues are [[mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] and responsibility,{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} applied to [[Temperance (virtue)|food]], work, behavior, and with regard to the [[reality in Buddhism|nature of life]].{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} Awareness, meditation and [[Appamada|heedfulness]] can also be included here.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=Ahiṃsa and Samādhi}} Medieval Pāli commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] writes that whereas violating the first four precepts may be more or less blamable depending on the person or animal affected, the fifth precept is always "greatly blamable", as it hinders one from understanding the Buddha's teaching and may lead one to "madness".{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} In ancient China, Daoshi described alcohol as the "doorway to laxity and idleness" and as a cause of suffering. Nevertheless, he did describe certain cases when drinking was considered less of a problem, such as in the case of a queen distracting the king by alcohol to prevent him from murder.&lt;!--page=224--&gt; However, Daoshi was generally strict in his interpretations: for example, he allowed medicinal use of alcohol only in extreme cases.&lt;!--p=227--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=224, 227}} Early Chinese translations of the [[Tripitaka]] describe negative consequences for people breaking the fifth precept, for themselves and their families. The Chinese translation of the ''Upāsikaśila Sūtra'', as well as the Pāli version of the [[Sigalovada Sutta|Sigālovāda Sutta]], speak of ill consequences such as loss of wealth, ill health, a bad reputation and "stupidity", concluding in a rebirth in hell.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}}{{sfn |Benn |2005 |page=225}} The ''[[Dīrghāgama]]'' adds to that that alcohol leads to quarreling, negative states of mind and damage to one's intelligence.&lt;!--p=225--&gt; The Mahāyāna ''[[Brahmajala Sutra|Brahmajāla Sūtra]]''{{refn |Not to be confused with the early Buddhist [[Brahmajala Sutta]]. |group=note}} describes the dangers of alcohol in very strong terms, including the selling of alcohol.&lt;!--p=226--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=225{{en dash}}6}} Similar arguments against alcohol can be found in [[Nāgārjuna]]'s writings.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=78}} The strict interpretation of prohibition of alcohol consumption can be supported by the ''Upāli Sūtra''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s statement that a disciple of the Buddha should not drink any alcohol, "even a drop on the point of a blade of grass".&lt;!--p=78--&gt; However, in the writing of some [[Abhidharma]] commentators, consumption was condemned or condoned, depending on the intention with which alcohol was consumed.&lt;!--78-9--&gt;{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=78{{en dash}}9}}

=== In practice ===
As for the fifth precept, this is regarded as important, because drinking alcohol is condemned for the sluggishness and lack of self-control it leads to,{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}}{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=62}} which might lead to breaking the other precepts.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} In Spiro's field studies, violating the fifth precept was seen as the worst of all the five precepts by half of the monks interviewed, citing the harmful consequences.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} Nevertheless, in practice it is often disregarded by lay people.{{sfn |Neumaier |2006 |page=78}} In Thailand, drinking alcohol is fairly common, even drunkenness.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=185}} Among Tibetans, drinking beer is common, though this is only slightly alcoholic.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=78}} Medicinal use of alcohol is generally not frowned upon,{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=298 }} and in some countries like Thailand and Laos, smoking is usually not regarded as a violation of the precept. Thai and Laotian monks have been known to smoke, though monks who have received more training are less likely to smoke.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}{{sfn |Vanphanom |Phengsavanh |Hansana |Menorath |2009 |page=100}} On a similar note, as of 2000, no Buddhist country prohibited the sale or consumption of alcohol, though in Sri Lanka Buddhist revivalists attempted unsuccessfully to get a full prohibition passed in 1956.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}} Moreover, pre-Communist Tibet used to prohibit smoking in some areas of the capital. Monks were prohibited from smoking, and the import of tobacco was banned.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}

Thich Nhat Hanh also includes the aspect of mindful consumption in this precept, which consists of unhealthy food, unhealthy entertainment and unhealthy conversations, among others.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}}

In modern times, adherence to the precepts among Buddhists is less strict than it traditionally was. This is especially true for the third precept. For example, in Cambodia in the 1990s and 2000s, standards with regard to sexual restraint were greatly relaxed.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=153}} Some Buddhist movements and communities have tried to go against the modern trend of less strict adherence to the precepts.

In many Western Buddhist organizations, the five precepts play a major role in developing ethical guidelines.{{sfn |Bluck |2006 |page=193}} Furthermore, Buddhist teachers such as [[Philip Kapleau]], Thich Nhat Hanh and [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] have promoted mindful consumption in the West, based on the five precepts.{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}} In another development in the West, some scholars working in the field of [[mindfulness]] training have proposed that the five precepts be introduced as a component in such trainings. Specifically, to prevent organizations from using mindfulness training to further an economical agenda with harmful results to its employees, the economy or the environment, the precepts could be used as a standardized ethical framework.&lt;!--p=957--&gt; As of 2015, several training programs made explicit use of the five precepts as secular, ethical guidelines.&lt;!--pp=958-9--&gt; However, many mindfulness training specialists consider it problematic to teach the five precepts as part of training programs in secular contexts because of their religious origins and import.&lt;!--pp=965-6--&gt;{{sfn |Baer |2015 |pages=957{{en dash}}9, 965{{en dash}}6}}

[[peace and conflict studies|Peace studies]] scholar Theresa Der-lan Yeh notes that the five precepts address physical, economical, familial and verbal aspects of interaction, and remarks that many conflict prevention programs in schools and communities have integrated the five precepts in their curriculum. On a similar note, peace studies founder [[Johan Galtung]] describes the five precepts as the "basic contribution of Buddhism in the creation of peace".{{sfn |Yeh |2006 |p=100}}

Studying lay and monastic ethical practice in traditional Buddhist societies, Spiro argued ethical guidelines such as the five precepts are adhered to as a means to a higher end, that is, a better rebirth or enlightenment. He therefore concluded that Buddhist ethical principles like the five precepts are similar to Western [[utilitarianism]].{{sfn |Buswell |2004}} Keown, however, has argued that the five precepts are regarded as rules that cannot be violated, and therefore may indicate a [[deontological]] perspective in Buddhist ethics.{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=618}}{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=643}} On the other hand, he has suggested that Aristoteles' [[virtue ethics]] could apply as well, since the precepts are considered good in themselves, and mutually dependent on other aspects of the Buddhist path of practice.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=481}}

=== Comparison with human rights ===
Keown has further argued that the five precepts are very similar to human rights, with regard to subject matter and with regard to their universal nature.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |pages=31{{en dash}}4}} Other scholars, as well as Buddhist writers and human rights advocates, have drawn similar comparisons.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |pages=540{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |p=78}} For example, the following comparisons are drawn:
# Keown compares the first precept with the [[right to life]].{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} The Buddhism-informed Cambodian Institute for Human Rights (CIHR) draws the same comparison.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=540}}
# The second precept is compared by Keown and the CIHR with the right of property.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}}{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=540}}
# The third precept is compared by Keown to the "right to fidelity in marriage";{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} the CIHR construes this broadly as "right of individuals and the rights of society".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}
# The fourth precept is compared by Keown with the "right not to be lied to";{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} the CIHR writes "the right of human dignity".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}
# Finally, the fifth precept is compared by the CIHR with the right of individual security and a safe society.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}

Keown summarizes the relationship between Buddhist precepts and human rights as "look[ing] both ways along the juridical relationship, both what one is due to do, and to what is due to one".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=21}} On a similar note, Cambodian human rights advocates have argued that for human rights to be fully implemented in society, the strengthening of individual morality must also be addressed.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}} Buddhist monk and scholar [[P.A. Payutto|Phra Payutto]] sees the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Human Rights Declaration]] as an unfolding and detailing of the principles that are found in the five precepts, in which a sense of ownership is given to the individual, to make legitimate claims on one's rights.&lt;!--78--&gt; He believes that human rights should be seen as a part of human development,&lt;!--85, 88--&gt; in which one develops from [[śīla|moral discipline]] ({{lang-pi|sīla|italic=yes |link=no}}), to [[samadhi|concentration]] ({{lang-pi|samādhi|italic=yes |link=no}}) and finally [[paññā|wisdom]] ({{lang-pi|paññā|italic=yes |link=no}}).&lt;!--85--&gt; He does not believe, however, that human rights are [[natural rights]], but rather human conventions.&lt;!--79--&gt; Buddhism scholar Somparn Promta disagrees with him. He argues that human beings do have natural rights from a Buddhist perspective, and refers to the ''attūpanāyika-dhamma'', a teaching in which the Buddha prescribes a kind of [[golden rule]] of comparing oneself with others.&lt;!--79-80--&gt; (''See [[#Principles|§Principles]], above.'') From this discourse, Promta concludes that the Buddha has laid down the five precepts in order to protect individual rights such as right of life and property:&lt;!--80--&gt; human rights are implicit within the five precepts. Academic Buntham Phunsap argues, however, that though human rights are useful in culturally pluralistic societies, they are in fact not required when society is based on the five precepts. Phunsap therefore does not see human rights as part of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;!--86--&gt;{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |pp=78{{en dash}}80, 85{{en dash}}6, 88}}

"'''Free Thought and Official Propaganda'''" is a speech (and subsequent publication) delivered in 1922 by [[Bertrand Russell]] on the importance of unrestricted freedom of expression in society, and the problem of the state and [[political class]] interfering in this through control of education, fines, economic leverage, and distortion of evidence.

==Freedom of speech==
Russell starts out by describing the more common use of the term "free thought" to mean that one does not accept unquestioning belief in the popular religion of a region, or ideally of any religion at all. But he goes on to say that a more important and global kind of free thought is the freedom of pressure to believe any specific ideas, that one be allowed to have and express any opinion without penalty.

He notes that this is not allowed in any country at all, with the possible exception of China at that time. One could not, for example, immigrate to the US without swearing they are not an [[anarchist]] or [[polygamous]], and once inside must not be [[communist]]. In [[Great Britain]] he must not express disbelief in [[Christianity]], in Japan of [[Shintoism]].

Russell notes that countries like these may think of themselves as having freedom of expression, but that some ideas are so obviously "monstrous and immoral" that such tolerance does not apply to them. But, he points out, this is exactly the same view that allowed torture during the [[Inquisition]], that all ideas must be allowed to be expressed, no matter how obviously bad.

Next, Russell describes incidents in his own life that illustrate the lack of freedom of thought. 

# One is that his father was a Free Thinker (agnostic or atheist), who arranged for three year old Bertrand to be raised as a free thinker when he was dying, but that the courts had overridden this and forced him to be raised Christian. 
# In 1910 Russell failed to receive [[Liberal Party]] nomination for Parliament when the party's inner circle had learned he was agnostic.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/]
# When he became a lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Russell was not allowed to become a [[Fellow]] (like having tenure) because the establishment of the college didn't want to add an "anti-clerical" vote to the college government. When Russell subsequently expressed opposition to [[World War I]], he was fired.

This repression by the political class, Russell notes, is not limited to religion. Believers in [[free love]] or communism are treated even worse.

==Will to doubt==
{{cquote|What we need is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://suebrewton.com/2015/05/31/william-wordsworth-vs-bertrand-russell/ William Wordsworth vs. Bertrand Russell]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Next, Bertrand Russell describes importance of the [[will to doubt]].&lt;ref name="will"/&gt; In 1896, American philosopher [[William James]] had written about the [[will to believe]], and Russell uses this as a foil to express his own opposite position. James claimed that even without (or with conflicting) evidence, one might still simply ''choose' to believe in a thing — he cites Christianity — simply because one thinks the belief has beneficial outcomes. 

Russell, along with [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]] and others, responds to this by describing the ''will to doubt'', the choice to remain [[skeptic]]al because it is the more logical, rational position that will lead to understanding more truth, while a "will to believe" will inevitably bind one into untruths in some way. "None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth 18 in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate."&lt;ref name="free"/&gt;

As an example of the benefits of this kind of actual skepticism, Russell describe's [[Albert Einstein]]'s overturning of the conventional wisdom of [[physics]] at that time, comparing it to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] contradicting [[Biblical literalists]] of the previous century. 

What, Bertrand asks, if instead of overturning physics, Einstein had proposed something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics?&lt;ref name="will"&gt;[https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/18/bertrand-russell-free-thought-propaganda-doubt/ The Will to Doubt: Bertrand Russell on Free Thought and Our Only Effective Self-Defense Against Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|English people would have found elements of Prussianism in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot; nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service. All the old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the importation of his writings prohibited. Teachers favourable to him would have been dismissed. He, meantime, would have captured the Government of some backward country, where it would have 21 become illegal to teach anything except his doctrine, which would have grown into a mysterious dogma not understood by anybody. Ultimately the truth or falsehood of his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield, without the collection of any fresh evidence for or against it. '''This method is the logical outcome of William James’s will to believe.'''&lt;br/&gt;
What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Assuming that the need for rational doubt or [[fallibilism]] is understood to be important, Russell then goes on to address the question of why irrational certainty is so common. He says this is largely because of three factors.

* '''Education''' — Instead of public education being used to teach children healthy learning attitudes, they are used for the opposite, to indoctrinate children with dogma, often patently false, even known to be false by the officials imposing the education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/03/07/never-die/ I Would Never Die for My Beliefs Because I Might Be Wrong]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Propaganda''' — After being taught to read but not weigh evidence and form original opinions, children become adults who are then subjected to dubious or obviously false claims for the rest of their lives.
* '''Economic pressure''' — The State and political class will use its control of finances and economy to impose its ideas, by restricting the choices of those who disagree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1484">The title '''gonagas''' (or '''konagas'''), bird man, was a [[shaman]] ranking level in Northern [[Scandinavia]] amongst [[noaydde]]s, which possessed special level of spiritual knowledge and visualized themselves to have possession to transform oneself into a bird figure to "fly" over mountains. Because of this spiritual ability, [[Nicolaus Lundius Lappo|Lundius]] states they were treated more respectfully or had a higher position than other peoples. According to the myth they could "spiritual communicate," i.e. travel to trading ports in forehand and see what peoples would come to trade. And in the [[witchcraft]]ing period, the figure could not be burned on the stake because the fire would be smothered in the same way water cannot be ignited.

The word ultimately derives from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word for "[[Monarch|king]]" (Compare to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Kuningas'' and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''Kunigas'', both from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*Kuningaz''; in archaic contex the Finnish word simply had the meaning of "[[leader]]" or "high-ranked person" instead of monarch).

Since the 1990s, the [[Anglican Communion]] has struggled with controversy regarding [[homosexuality]] in the church. In 1998, the 13th [[Lambeth Conference]] of Anglican bishops passed a resolution stating that "homosexual acts" are "incompatible with [[Scripture]]". However, this is not legally binding. "Like all Lambeth Conference resolutions, it is not legally binding on all provinces of the Communion, including the Church of England, though it commends an essential and persuasive view of the attitude of the Communion."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2016/11/secretary-general-responds-to-gafcon-uk.aspx|title=Church of England News: Secretary General responds to GAFCON UK|work=Church of England News|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Anglican national churches in [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|South Africa]], [[Church of South India|South India]], [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia|New Zealand]] and [[Anglican Church of Canada|Canada]] have taken steps toward approving and celebrating same-sex relationships amid strong resistance among other national churches within the 80 million-member global body.

In 2002, the [[Anglican Diocese of New Westminster|Diocese of New Westminster]], in the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], permitted the [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessing of same-sex unions]]. In 2003, two openly [[gay]] men in England and the [[United States]] became candidates for [[bishop]]. In the [[Church of England]], [[Jeffrey John]] eventually succumbed to pressure to withdraw his name from consideration to be the [[Bishop of Reading]]. In the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]], [[Gene Robinson]] was elected and consecrated [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire|Bishop of New Hampshire]], becoming the first openly [[gay bishops|gay bishop]] in the Anglican Communion and in [[Apostolic succession|apostolic]] [[Christianity]]. This was highly controversial and led several hundred bishops to [[boycott]] the 2008 Lambeth Conference. As an alternative to Lambeth, many of these bishops attended the [[Global Anglican Futures Conference]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="Brittain/McKinnon1-3"&gt;Christopher Craig Brittain and Andrew McKinnon, "[http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3055/1/Anglican_Communion_Conflict_revision_01102010.pdf Homosexuality and the Construction of 'Anglican Orthodoxy': The Symbolic Politics of the Anglican Communion]," ''Sociology of Religion'' (2011), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, other Anglican provinces, including the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], permitted the ordination of gay clergy and others, such as the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church in the USA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/17/AR2009071702943.html|title=New Episcopal Measures on Gay Bishops, Same-Sex Unions May Cause Further Rift|work=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; permitted [[blessing of same-sex unions]] as well.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The BBC, in 2009, reported that many clergy in the Church of England "already bless same-sex couples on an unofficial basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian attitudes to same-sex marriage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/samesexmarriage.shtml|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many provinces, primarily from the [[Global South (Anglican)|Global South]] and representing about half of the 80 million active Anglicans worldwide, have responded to these theological disputes by declaring a state of [[Full communion|impaired communion]] with their Western counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tablet'', 26 July 2003,[http://www.thetablet.co.uk/cgi-bin/citw.cgi/past-00153 Row over homosexuality splits Anglican Communion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111233908/http://thetablet.co.uk/cgi-bin/citw.cgi/past-00153 |date=11 November 2005 }}. Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Minority groups in Western provinces have stated their opposition to what they consider un-scriptural actions by the churches in [[England]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the United States. Since 2000, some conservative Global South provinces have appointed missionary bishops to the United States and Canada to provide pastoral oversight to disaffected Anglicans. This process, known as [[Anglican realignment]], is considered by the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church USA]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] to be an illegitimate incursion into their territories; however, conservative Anglicans argued that the incursions were necessary because of the failure of these churches to uphold orthodox teaching with regard to [[human sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Brittain/McKinnon1-3"/&gt;

==Summary of issues==
{{Main|Anglican doctrine}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
There is a wide range of beliefs within the [[Anglican Communion]] regarding homosexuality. The majority of followers believe that heterosexuality or [[celibacy]] is required of Christians, but believe in tolerance towards others. This differs from secular society in most western democracies, which considers homosexuality to be a normal human variation, and affirms this in law. Some of the more specific issues under study within member churches and dioceses are:
* Same-sex attracted members of the church or communion
** May they exist?
*** Must they denounce their [[sexual orientation]] and strive to become [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]]?
*** Must they renounce [[same-sex relationships]] in order to be considered members in good standing?
** Must they be [[celibate]]?
** Should same-sex unions of [[LGBT]] members be blessed?
** Should same-sex couples be allowed a religious marriage ceremony?
* Same-sex attracted clergy
** May they exist?
** May they be openly authentic regarding their sexual orientation?
*** To what extent may they be "out" (e.g. only to their bishop, partner, spouse, or family, or to the wider public)
*** May they openly have a partner or spouse?
** Must they be celibate?
** May any of these individuals (those who are celibate and those who are non-celibate) be bishops?
[[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] churches are diverse in their views, from churches which do not accept any [[LGBT]] members, to churches which are happy to have openly same-sex, partnered or [[Marriage|married]], non-celibate bishops. The nature of the [[Anglican Communion]] is such that not all [[Parish church|churches]] or [[diocese]]s must agree on all issues in order to share a common [[faith]] and [[baptism]]. Part of the controversy concerns how much and what sort of disagreement over these issues may exist while still calling it a "common faith."

* The bishops of the Anglican Communion in 1998 upheld the traditional [[Christian]] teaching that [[marriage]] is between a man and a woman and that those who are not called to marriage so defined should remain celibate. A resolution was passed stating that "homosexual acts" are "incompatible with [[Scripture]]" by a vote of 526–70;&lt;ref&gt;David Skidmore, 7 August 1998, [http://www.lambethconference.org/1998/news/lc098.cfm Lambeth Conference 1998 Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728181157/http://www.lambethconference.org/1998/news/lc098.cfm |date=28 July 2012 }}. Retrieved 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; however, it also contained a statement which "calls on all our people to minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals, violence within marriage and any trivialisation and commercialisation of sex," and noted importantly: "We commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons and we wish to assure them that they are loved by God and that all baptised, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual orientation, are full members of the Body of Christ." The Lambeth Conference is "not an executive which imposes doctrine or discipline but it is a forum where the mind of the Communion can be expressed on matters of controversy."&lt;ref&gt;Site of The Archbishop of Canterbury, [http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/lambeth-conference.html Lambeth Conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210203358/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/lambeth-conference.html# |date=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 bishops, including some who voted in favour of the resolution, immediately repudiated it and signed a letter of apology to gay and lesbian Anglicans. However over 80% of the bishops did not do so.
* In 2002, the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Anglican Diocese of New Westminster|Diocese of New Westminster]] voted to allow the blessing and officiation of same-sex unions and marriages by those parishes who choose to do so.
* The Church of England affirmed in 2005 that lay gay members who have entered into civil partnerships are still eligible for the [[sacrament]]s of [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], and [[Communion (Christian)|communion]].&lt;ref name="Pastoral_statement"&gt;Church of England News, 25 July 2005.[http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2005/07/pr5605.aspx House of Bishops issues pastoral statement on Civil Partnerships].

* [[Sexual orientation]], specifically the [[consecration]] of [[Gene Robinson]], was a major issue at the 2008 [[Lambeth Conferences|Lambeth Conference]]. A group of [[conservative]] bishops opposed to the ordination and marriage of same-sex attracted people, including most of the "[[Global South (Anglican)|global south]]", gathered in June 2008 at the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]].
* In 2013, in the Church of England, "The House [of Bishops] has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/01/statement-regarding-clergy-in-a-civil-partnership-as-candidates-for-the-episcopate.aspx|title=Church of England News: Statement Regarding Clergy in a Civil Partnership as Candidates for the Episcopate|newspaper=Church of England News|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1973 Archbishop of York’s statement===
While serving as Archbishop of York, [[Donald Coggan]] declared on [[BBC]] radio in 1973 that many Anglican clergymen were homosexuals. "We must treat them," he proclaimed, "with great sympathy and understanding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064731,00.html ''People'' magazine (Dec 2, 1974 Vol. 2 No. 23)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops===
{{main|Lambeth Conference#3.13 Thirteenth: 1998}}
Regarding "human sexuality", the conference said that it upholds "faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union, and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage." Furthermore, it refused to "advise the legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions."&lt;ref&gt;1998 Lambeth Conference, Resolution 1.10, "Human Sexuality", Online at http://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/document-library/lambeth-conference/1998/section-i-called-to-full-humanity/section-i10-human-sexuality?author=Lambeth+Conference&amp;year=1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was 526-70.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Prichard, ''A History of the Episcopal Church'' (Morehouse 3rd rev ed, 2014), p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999 Cambridge Accord===
{{main|Cambridge Accord}}
In response to the division following the Lambeth Conference of the previous year, most Church of England bishops (although not including the then Archibishop of Canterbury [[George Carey]]), and many others elsewhere in the Anglican Communion, agreed on a document that upheld the human rights of homosexual people, while recognising and not seeking to resolve division over the morality of homosexual acts.

===Gene Robinson consecrated bishop===
In August 2003 the [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire]] elected an openly [[gay]] and partnered [[priest]], [[Gene Robinson]], as [[bishop]]. This came shortly after a similar controversy in [[England]] when an [[Coming out|openly]] [[gay]] [[priest]], Canon [[Jeffrey John]], was appointed to become the [[Suffragan bishop|Suffragan Bishop]] of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Eventually, however, John agreed to withdraw in order to avoid division. In 2004, in the aftermath of Robinson's election as [[bishop]], John was installed as [[Dean of St Albans]], the [[cathedral]] there being the site of England's first [[Christian]] [[martyr]].

===2003 Lambeth Palace meeting===
As a result of the controversy over the ordination of [[gay bishops]] and the blessing of [[Civil union|same-sex unions]], on 15 October 2003, Anglican leaders from around the world met in [[Lambeth Palace]] in an attempt to avoid a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] on the issue. The day after, they released a lengthy statement:&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 16 October 2003, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3198992.stm Anglican leaders' statement]. Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We must make clear that recent actions in New Westminster and in the Episcopal Church (USA) do not express the mind of our Communion as a whole, and these decisions jeopardise our sacramental fellowship with each other. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If his ''[Gene Robinson's]'' consecration proceeds, we recognise that we have reached a crucial and critical point in the life of the Anglican Communion and we have had to conclude that the future of the Communion itself will be put in jeopardy. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In this case, the ministry of this one bishop will not be recognised by most of the Anglican world, and many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of Communion with the Episcopal Church (USA). This will tear the fabric of our Communion at its deepest level, and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the Episcopal Church (USA). ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Similar considerations apply to the situation pertaining in the Diocese of New Westminster. We commend the report of that Conference in its entirety to all members of the Anglican Communion, valuing especially its emphasis on the need to listen to the experience of homosexual persons, and [...] to assure them that they are loved by God and that all baptised, believing and faithful persons, regardless of sexual orientation, are full members of the [[Body of Christ]]"; and its acknowledgement of the need for ongoing study on questions of [[human sexuality]]. ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As Primates, it is not for us to pass judgement on the constitutional processes of another province. We recognise the sensitive balance between provincial autonomy and the expression of critical opinion by others on the internal actions of a province.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Statements from Rowan Williams===

In 2004 the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], wrote a letter to Anglican churches worldwide in which he condemned comments by bishops outside the [[Western culture|Western]] world for inciting violence against gay men and women.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 28 November 2004,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4049013.stm Churches warned over 'gay slurs']. Retrieved 12 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any words that could make it easier for someone to attack or abuse a homosexual person are words of which we must repent. Do not think [[repentance]] is always something others are called to, but acknowledge the failings we all share, [[sin]]ful and struggling [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s as we are.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2007 speech to theology students in [[Toronto]], Williams argued that [[Christian fundamentalism|conservatives]] have failed to consider the wider context of [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:27, which states, "and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for error." Williams pointed out that although [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] (the author of this [[epistle]]) and his contemporaries viewed sex between two people of the same sex "as obviously immoral as [[idolatry|idol worship]] or [[obedience (human behavior)|disobedience]] to parents", the main point of this passage is that humans must not judge one another for being [[sin]]ful: Romans 2:1 says "Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge another: for in passing judgment upon him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things." Williams admitted that his analysis "does nothing to settle the exegetical questions fiercely debated at the moment", but called upon [[Christian fundamentalism|conservatives]] to avoid self-righteousness rather than "happily identifying with Paul's castigation of someone else".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Heneghan, Yahoo!

===Subsequent division===
Bishops from two Anglican provinces, the [[Church of the Province of Rwanda|Province of Rwanda]] and the [[Church of the Province of South East Asia|Province of South East Asia]], consecrated missionary bishops for the United States in January 2000 and formally established the Anglican Mission in America (now called the [[Anglican Mission in the Americas]]) later that year. In 2010, a similar jurisdiction created by the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]] and former members and congregations of the [[Episcopal Church in the USA]] was officially launched. Four dioceses which withdrew from the Episcopal Church account for the majority of the nearly 700 congregations affiliated with this church, the [[Anglican Church in North America]]. These two bodies—AMiA and ACNA—reject the creation of rites for same-sex unions as well as the ordination of openly gay people. Neither is a member of the Anglican Communion at present (see [[Anglican realignment]]).

Bishops in [[Uganda]] cut relations with the [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire|Diocese of New Hampshire]] following [[Gene Robinson|Robinson]]'s consecration on 2 November 2003. The [[Church of Nigeria]] declared itself in "impaired communion" with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] on 2 November 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Akinola, [http://www.anglican-nig.org/glbsouthst.htm Statement of the Primates of the Global South in the Anglican Communion in response to the consecration of Gene Robinson on 2 November 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606000650/http://www.anglican-nig.org/glbsouthst.htm |date=6 June 2007 }}.

===Windsor Report and 2005 Primates Meeting===
In 2004, the Lambeth Commission on Communion issued a report on homosexuality in the Anglican Communion, which became known as the [[Windsor Report]]. This report took a strong stand against same-sex attracted people, recommended a moratorium on further consecrations of openly gay bishops and blessings of same-sex unions and marriages,&lt;ref&gt;The Windsor Report 2004.[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/windsor2004/section_d/p3.cfm On public Rites of Blessing of same sex unions]. Retrieved 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and called for all involved in Robinson's consecration "to consider in all conscience whether they should withdraw themselves from representative functions in the Anglican Communion".&lt;ref&gt;The Windsor Report 2004. [http://www.anglicancommunion.org/windsor2004/section_d/p2.cfm On elections to the episcopate].

Haines, Bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Washington]]. The statement apologised to Lesbian and Gay Anglicans for the Windsor Report and for the fact that their voices were not heard by the Conference. By October 30, 1998, the statement had been co-signed by 183 bishops representing every continent except Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gays-Future-Anglicanism-Responses-Windsor/dp/190504738X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463504591&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=homosexuality+Lambeth Andrew Linzey and Richard Kirker, eds., ''Gays and the Future of Anglicanism: Responses to the Windsor Report'' (O Books, 2005)'', 337-338.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2005 Primates' Meeting.''' In February 2005, the [[Primates in the Anglican Communion|Primates of the Anglican Communion]] held a [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting|regular meeting]] at Dromantine in [[Northern Ireland]] at which sexual orientation was heavily discussed. Of the 38 Primates, 35 attended. The Primates issued a communiqué that reiterated most of the Windsor Report's statements, but added a new twist. Both the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] were asked to voluntarily withdraw from the [[Anglican Consultative Council]], the main formal international entity within the [[Anglican Communion]] until the next [[Lambeth Conference]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;“The Anglican Communion The Primates’ Meeting, February 2005 Communiqué,” Sec 14, 3-4.

===2007 Primates’ Meeting===
The “Communiqué of the Primates’ Meeting, February 2007" (Sec 17, 4) asserted its "belief that The Episcopal Church has departed from the standard of teaching on human sexuality accepted by the Communion in the 1998 Lambeth Resolution 1.10 by consenting to the episcopal election of a candidate living in a committed same-sex relationship, and by permitting Rites of Blessing for same-sex unions. The episcopal ministry of a person living in a same-sex relationship is not acceptable to the majority of the Communion."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/68393/communique2007_english.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consecration of Mary Douglas Glasspool ===

In December 2009, the [[Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles|Diocese of Los Angeles]] elected [[Mary Douglas Glasspool]], a lesbian priest with a female partner as a [[Suffragan bishop|suffragan bishop]]. She was consecrated on 15 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Traditionalist Who Shakes Tradition|author=Lisa Miller|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236478|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaders from 20 Anglican provinces meeting in [[Singapore]] in April 2010 declared that the election and intended consecration of Glasspool “demonstrated, yet again, a total disregard for the mind of the Communion”.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Bowder, "Trumpet blast from the Global South," ''Church Times'', 21 Apr 2010.

===2016 Primates’ Meeting===
A majority of the primates voted to punish the Episcopal Church for revising its canons and marriage rites allowing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] at its 2015 triennial [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] adopted "canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians." The canonical change eliminated "language defining marriage as between a man and a woman." The two new marriage rites contain language that allows "them to be used by same-sex or opposite-sex couples." Episcopal News Service staff, "General Convention wrap-up: Historic actions, structural changes" (7 July 2015). Online at http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2015/07/07/general-convention-wrap-up-historic-actions-structural-changes/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primates' communiqué included these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is our unanimous desire to walk together. However given the seriousness of these matters we formally acknowledge this distance by requiring that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church no longer represent us on ecumenical and interfaith bodies, should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and that while participating in the internal bodies of the Anglican Communion, they will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or polity.&lt;ref&gt;“Communiqué from the Primates of the Anglican Communion,” 15 Jan 2016.

The communiqué condemned "homophobic prejudice and violence and resolved to work together to offer pastoral care and loving service irrespective of sexual orientation", adding that "this conviction arises out of our discipleship of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="episcopaldigitalnetwork.com"&gt;Matthew Davies and Mary Frances Schjonberg, "Welby apologizes for persecution on the grounds of sexuality" (Episcopal News Service, January 15, 2016).

====Archbishop of Canterbury apologises====
Shortly after the meeting of the Anglican primates, Archbishop [[Justin Welby]] held a press conference in which he apologised “to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people for the hurt and pain they have experienced by the Anglican Communion over the years.” Welby said, “it is for me a constant source of deep sadness that people are persecuted for their sexuality … I want to take this opportunity personally to say how sorry I am for the hurt and pain in the past and present that the church has caused.”&lt;ref name="episcopaldigitalnetwork.com"/&gt;

The Church of England has been discussing human sexuality, same-sex unions, and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-religion-samesex/church-of-england-proposes-celebrating-gay-marriage-idUKBRE9AR0CP20131128|title=Church of England proposes celebrating gay marriage|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current position of the Church of England is that marriage is between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38768217|title=Church 'should keep gay marriage stance'|date=2017|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of England has also maintained the position that it supports celibate same-sex relationships including [[civil partnership]]. "We believe that Civil Partnerships still have a place, including for some Christian LGBTI couples who see them as a way of gaining legal recognition of their relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Keep-civil-partnerships-Church-of-England-urges-Government|title=Keep civil partnerships, Church of England urges Government - Premier|last=Premier|date=2018-05-18|work=Premier|accessdate=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Bishops and Archbishop's Council communicated that "The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality.

In December 1991, the House of Bishops issued ''Issues in Human Sexuality''. In the preface, Archbishop [[George Carey]] described it as a document for "careful study and reflection". The conclusion of the document listed questions for reflection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media/445118/humansexualitych5.pdf ''Issues in Human Sexuality''.]&lt;/ref&gt; On the tenth anniversary of the publication of ''Issues in Human Sexuality'', the Bishop of Wolverhampton, [[Michael Bourke]], wrote that "''Issues'' aspired to help forward a debate on the subject", but rather than serving its stated purpose, "''Issues'' has been presented as a consensus to which all bishops are expected to subscribe. Instead of enabling open and charitable discussion, it has served as an instrument of management and control."&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Brierley, ed., ''Public Life and the Place of the Church: Reflections to Honour the Bishop of Oxford'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of human sexuality erupted when [[Jeffrey John]], an openly gay priest, was elected [[Bishop of Reading]] in May 2003. Before he could take up his post there was strong opposition from a minority of [[bishop]]s and he was persuaded to not proceed with the appointment. However, many senior bishops{{who|date=April 2016}} have voiced disappointment at his decision to resign. Later in 2004 he was installed as [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of St. Albans. Further controversy erupted when churches in the [[Diocese of St Albans]] decided that they would withhold contributions until further notice to protest this appointment. St. Peter and Paul's Church in Cranfield, near [[Bedford]], and [[Holy Trinity]] Church in [[New Barnet]], north of [[Greater London]], pledged to withhold money from diocesan funds in protest. [[St Andrew]]'s Church in the [[Hertfordshire]] town of [[Chorleywood]] also announced that it would withhold funds until further notice. Yet, in 2002, reporters confirmed that hundreds of same-sex blessings occur, although unofficially, every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1410695/Vicars-bless-hundreds-of-gay-couples-a-year.html|title=Vicars bless hundreds of gay couples a year|last=Bisset|first=By Chris Hastings, Fiona Govan and Susan|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, "the majority of Bishops who voted during the whole passage of the Civil Partnerships Act through [the] Lordships' House were in favour of civil partnerships."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5069/archbishop-justins-speech-to-the-lords-on-the-governments-gay-marriage-bill|title=Archbishop Justin's speech to the Lords on the government's gay marriage Bill|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight bishops voted in favour of civil unions and two voted against the passage of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media/1472983/cptimeline.doc|title=The Lords Spiritual and Civil Partnership Legislation|last=|first=|date=2004|website=www.churchofengland.org|publisher=Church of England|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July 2005, the House of Bishops issued a pastoral statement on the “implications of the [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|Civil Partnerships]]” which came into force on 5 December 2005. The statement reaffirmed “the Church’s teaching on both marriage and sexual intercourse”. It also noted that “the new legislation makes no change to the law in relation to marriage”.&lt;ref name="churchofengland.org"&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2005/07/pr5605.aspx Bishops’ Pastoral Statement on Civil Partnerships. Retrieved July 27, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; The statement went on to say that “clergy of the Church of England should not provide services of blessing for those who register a civil partnership”. However, it said that if clergy are “approached by people asking for prayer in relation to entering into a civil partnership,” they should “respond pastorally and sensitively”. Regarding clergy themselves, “entering into a civil partnership” was not considered “intrinsically incompatible with holy orders, provided the person concerned is willing to give assurances to his or her bishop that the relationship is consistent with the standards for the clergy set out in [https://www.churchofengland.org/media/445118/humansexualitych5.pdf ''Issues in Human Sexuality'' (House of Bishops, December 1991).]”. "The House of Bishops considers it would be a matter of social injustice to exclude from ministry those who are faithful to the teaching of the Church, and who decide to register a civil partnership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2005/07/pr5605.aspx|title=Church of England News: House of Bishops issues pastoral statement on Civil Partnerships|work=Church of England News|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;However, the statement said that “lay people who have registered civil partnerships ought not to be asked to give assurances about the nature of their relationship before being admitted to baptism, confirmation and communion.’&lt;ref name="churchofengland.org" /&gt;

On 21 December 2005, in another controversial act which was contrary to the House of Bishops’ pastoral statement, the Rt. Rev. David Jenkins, the former Bishop of Durham, offered a blessing for a vicar who had entered into a same-sex partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506074/Church-blessing-for-homosexual-vicar.html|title=Church blessing for homosexual vicar|last=Correspondent|first=By Jonathan Petre, Religion|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] adopted a motion. In part it read that nothing should be done “that could be perceived as the Church of England qualifying its commitment to the entirety of the relevant Lambeth Conference Resolutions”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/marriage,-family-and-sexuality-issues/human-sexuality/lesbian-and-gay-christians,-general-synod-debate-2007.aspx Lesbian and Gay Christians Synod Debate]&lt;/ref&gt; At Lambeth Conference 1998, homosexuality was that the most hotly debated issue. Its Resolution 1.10 stated in an amendment passed by a vote of 389–190 that "homosexual practice" is "incompatible with Scripture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/76650/1998.pdf Resolutions Archive from 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in spite of the action by the General Synod, St Bartholomew's Church in London offered a rite of blessing for two priests entering into a same-sex civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wynne-Jones|first1=Jonathan|title=Male priests marry in Anglican church's first gay 'wedding'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2130668/Male-priests-marry-in-Anglican-churchs-first-gay-wedding.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, other dioceses and parishes supported the inclusion of gay and lesbian priests. In 2008, the Diocese of London provided guidelines saying "clergy ... may use a form of service they consider suitable in respect of a civil partnership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seed|first1=Nigel|title=Church Services After A Civil Partnership|url=http://inclusive-church.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/Chancellor%20Nigel%20Seed%20Guidance.pdf|website=inclusive-church.org.uk|publisher=Diocese of London|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, some churches "[offer] dedication services to civil partners" as allowed within those guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9853688/Gay-marriage-priests-to-defy-Church-line-with-same-sex-services.html|title=Gay marriage: priests to defy Church line with same-sex services|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the General Synod voted to extend pensions and employee benefits to gay and lesbian priests living with their partners in civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Church of England General Synod extends pension rights for gay partners|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/11/anglican-synod-gay-pension-rights|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2010-02-11|access-date = 2016-02-24|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Stephen|last = Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the House of Bishops ruled that priests in same-sex civil partnerships could be consecrated as bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/04/church-of-england-gay-bishops|title=Church of England rules gay men in civil partnerships can become bishops|last=Walker|first=Peter|date=2013-01-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the House of Bishops of the Church of England commissioned a Working Group on Human Sexuality. The working group included Sir [[Joseph Pilling]] chairman, four bishops and three advisers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2013/11/pilling-report-published.aspx Pilling Report Published. Retrieved July 27, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, Archbishop [[John Sentamu]] said he sees marriage as heterosexual, but that "[civil partnerships] are in every respect in ethical terms an honourable contract of a committed relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofyork.org/articles.php/2481/a-response-on-marriage-and-civil-partnerships|title=A Response on Marriage and Civil Partnerships|website=www.archbishopofyork.org|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;In 2012, the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, London, the Very Revd David Ison, announced his support for same-sex marriage and said that he had officiated at blessings or prayer services for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9130171/Dr-David-Ison-new-Dean-of-St-Paul-backs-gay-marriage.html|title=Dr David Ison, new Dean of St Paul, backs gay marriage|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing Attitude UK, an affirming group of clergy, laity, and churches within the Church of England, provides a list of prayer services allowed including a "Service of Celebration following a Civil Partnership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Service of Celebration following a Civil Partnership|url=http://changingattitude.org.uk/resources/services-of-blessing-for-same-sex-relationships/a-service-of-celebration-following-a-civil-partnership|website=changingattitude.org.uk|publisher=Changing Attitude|accessdate=April 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508125339/http://changingattitude.org.uk/resources/services-of-blessing-for-same-sex-relationships/a-service-of-celebration-following-a-civil-partnership|archive-date=8 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bishop of the Diocese of Oxford has given permission for at least one same-sex celebration to be officiated by a Church of England priest who presided for the high-profile ceremony for the Rev.

In April 2013, the Church of England's Faith and Order Commission, in a missive to clergy, also communicated that "there was a need for committed same-sex couples to be given recognition and 'compassionate attention' from the Church, including special prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9983121/Church-of-England-gives-blessing-to-recognising-civil-partnerships.html|title=Church of England gives blessing to recognising civil partnerships|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the church also stated that "The church has no truck with homophobia and even supports clergy who are in civil partnerships&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/church.of.england.supports.gay.clergy.amid.discrimination.suit/56828.htm|title=Church of England supports gay clergy amid discrimination suit {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the Report of the Working Group on Human Sexuality (nicknamed the Pilling Report) was published. It said that the Church should "stand firmly" against "homophobic attitudes" and should repent "for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past, and to demonstrate the unconditional acceptance and love of God in Christ for all people". The report's key recommendation was "that the church's internal dialogue on the subject of human sexuality might best be addressed through a process of conversations across the church and involving others in the Anglican Communion". This recommendation was endorsed and acted on by the church as recounted later in this section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/media/2015811/gs%20misc%201083%20-%20shared%20conversations%20on%20sexuality,%20scripture%20and%20mission.pdf Pilling Report Recommends Shared Conversation.

After the legalisation of same-sex marriages, the Church of England communicated that "the option of civil partnership should remain open for same-sex couples."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/church.of.england.says.civil.partnerships.should.not.be.abolished.following.gay.marriage.legalisation/36731.htm|title=Church of England says civil partnerships should not be abolished following gay marriage legalisation {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the [[House of Bishops]] decreed the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26206192 No Gay Couple Blessings, 15 February 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
* No special services of blessing for married same-sex couples, but allowed "more informal kinds of prayer, at the request of the couple [but this should] be accompanied by pastoral discussion of the Church's teaching and [the couple's] reasons for departing from it."
* Clergy will not be allowed to enter same-sex marriages.
* Clergy of the same sex are allowed by the Church to enter civil partnerships, but only on the understanding that they will remain celibate.

Still, "gay couples who get married will be able to ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding, the bishops have agreed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10640144/Church-offers-prayers-after-same-sex-weddings-but-bans-gay-priests-from-marrying.html|title=Church offers prayers after same-sex weddings - but bans gay priests from marrying|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, some congregations have offered "Prayers for a Same Sex Commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmaryandstnicolas.org.uk/prayerssame.html|title=St Mary and St Nicolas - Prayers for Same Sex Couples|last=Bennett|first=John|website=www.stmaryandstnicolas.org.uk|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover,  "Bishops have little power to prevent gay clergy from marrying nor to sack them if they do. A panel of three senior bishops has been set up to advise other bishops on how to apply the guidance when clergy dissent. The usual format is an informal letter of rebuke and no further action, meaning more and more clergy are choosing to marry their same-sex partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/another.gay.anglican.priest.marries.long.term.partner/92022.htm|title=Another gay Anglican priest marries long-term partner {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Irish bishops released a statement on the continuing conversations surrounding human sexuality. The Bishops stated that the church's teaching is that marriage is between a man and a woman, but acknowledged that they are divided on the subject themselves.

The [[Church in Wales]] currently has clergy and lay members with differing views regarding the subject of human sexuality. However, the trend has been for the church to move in a more liberal direction. The Church in Wales has taken steps toward allowing same-sex marriages and blessing rites for same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Church-in-Wales-to-consider-allowing-gay-marriage|title=Church in Wales to consider allowing gay marriage - Premier|last=Premier|date=2018-09-13|work=Premier|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Welsh bishops released a statement declaring it "unjust" to not provide formal provisions for same-sex marriages and civil partnerships, the General Synod voted in favour of requesting such formal rites for same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-45503615|title=Provision explored for same sex couples|date=2018-09-12|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the Church in Wales has permitted priests to enter into same-sex [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]]. “The Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships who are in a sexual relationship can serve as clergy. If the issue arises, it is up to the relevant Bishop to decide.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2015, the governing body voted in favour of same-sex marriages, but a policy change requires further action.

Among the dioceses, the Diocese of St Asaph and the Diocese of Llandaff overwhelmingly supported same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-Sex Partnerships|url=http://cinw.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/13_02_SameSexPartnershipNote.pdf|website=churchinwales.org.uk|publisher=Governing Body|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 52% of the Governing Body voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages in church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2017/3-february/news/uk/the-welsh-church-is-now-a-more-welcoming-place|title=The Welsh Church is now a ‘more welcoming place’|website=www.churchtimes.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the Bench of Bishops decided to fully affirm same-sex couples and offer prayers of celebration for same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livingchurch.org/unofficial-blessings-wales|title=Unofficial Blessings in Wales - The Living Church|website=www.livingchurch.org|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the prayers provided for same-sex couples, Form One gives God thanks "for [the two people], who have found such love and companionship in each other, that it has led them to dedicate their lives in support of one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prayers that may be said with a couple following the Celebration of Civil Partnership or Civil Marriage|last=|first=|publisher=Church in Wales|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scottish Episcopal Church===
{{Main|Scottish Episcopal Church}}

The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] (SEC) does not have a policy against [[Ordination|ordaining]] non-celibate gay clergy, thus such ordinations are theoretically allowed. They announced this on 23 March 2005:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[We] had never regarded the fact that someone was in a close relationship with a member of the same sex as in itself constituting a bar to the exercise of an ordained ministry ... We do not have a synodical decision like the Church of England has, which it made a number of years ago, and therefore if someone who was of a homosexual orientation felt a sense of call to the ordained ministry then we would begin the process of testing that vocation. We wouldn't bar him or her simply because they were homosexual."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Headlines in [[North America]] announced that the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] had agreed to ordain gay and lesbian people in committed relationships. The Church thus released a statement pointing out that the policy was not news. Regarding the media release, the Church said: "Press interest has focused on one small part of the overall statement". It continued to say that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In referring to the fact that there is no current bar to ordination for someone who might be in a close relationship with a member of the same sex, the Bishops were simply stating the present position as it applies in Scotland where, unlike some other provinces, no motion discouraging such ordinations has ever been passed by our General Synod. Consequently, the statement earlier this month does not represent any change in policy on the part of the Bishops."&lt;ref&gt;Thinking Anglicans: Book review archives, 24 March 2005.[http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/001085.html More on Scotland].

===Church of South India===
{{Main|Church of South India}}

The Church of South [[India]], although divided in opinion like many Anglican provinces, has many outspoken clergy in favour of rights for same-sex couples. "The Church of South India (CSI) [is] a relatively liberal Protestant church which has, since 1984, allowed women to become pastors. 'CSI has been liberal on these issues.

===Church of the Province of South East Asia===

([[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nepal]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]])

The Province of South East Asia criticised the confirmation of [[Gene Robinson]] as a bishop by the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church (USA)]], stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The said confirmation therefore seriously raises the question of ECUSA's genuine commitment to our corporate responsibility as members of the church catholic to uphold and promote only the Apostolic Faith and Order inherited. A natural, holistic and consistent reading of the Scriptures clearly show that it is against the practise of homosexuality. In the context of orthodox and classical Christianity, the canonical authority of the Scriptures is taken to be recognized and received by the community of faith and not subject to majority, culturally relevant or even theological voting."&lt;ref&gt;Diocese of Singapore, 13 August 2003. [http://www.anglican.org.sg/bishop_gene_robinson.html Statement of Bishops of the Province of the Anglican Church in South East Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526161339/http://www.anglican.org.sg/bishop_gene_robinson.html |date=26 May 2006 }}. Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 24 November 2003, the province declared that it had entered into a state of impaired communion with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] by releasing the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Synod of the Province of the Anglican Church of South East Asia unanimously rejects the purported consecration of Dr Gene Robinson on 2 November 2003 by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in New Hampshire, as a bishop in the Anglican Church. The Province views the purported consecration as a flagrant disregard of the fundamental teachings of the Bible and the long-established doctrines of the Church.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As the Rev. Gene Robinson is a practising homosexual who had divorced his wife and has, for the last 13 years, been living with a male partner, the Province cannot and does not recognize his consecration and ministry in the Anglican church.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of the ECUSA's action in proceeding with the consecration despite the warnings and pleas of a large majority of Anglican churches worldwide, the Province regrets that communion with the ECUSA as well as those who voted for the consecration and those who participated in the consecration service is now broken.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This means that the Province no longer treats those in ECUSA who carried out and supported the act of consecration as brothers and sisters in Christ unless and until they repent of their action and return to embrace Biblical truths.

Archbishop [[Gregory James Venables|Gregory Venables]] has also been strongly critical of homosexuality. Bishops in his province criticised the Windsor Report for failing to call liberal churches to repentance. The province has declared itself in "impaired communion" with ECUSA, but continues to maintain full communion with opponents of the Robinson consecration.&lt;ref&gt;Anglican Communion News Service, 12 January 2004.

Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Venables has authorised dioceses within his province to provide episcopal oversight to United States churches that have left ECUSA.

In December 2007, the convention of the [[Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] diocese in [[Central Valley (California)|central]] [[California]], voted to leave the ECUSA and joined the [[Anglican Church of South America|Province of the Southern Cone]] as the [[Anglican Diocese of San Joaquin]]. A minority of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Diocese remained in the ECUSA. In October 2008, a majority of the convention of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh]] voted to leave ECUSA and affiliate with the [[Anglican Church of South America|Southern Cone]], resulting in [[Anglican Diocese of Pittsburgh|one body affiliated with the Southern Cone]] and [[Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh (Episcopal Church)|a second body remaining within ECUSA]]. The following month, the conventions of two more US dioceses—the [[Diocese of Quincy (Southern Cone)|Diocese of Quincy]] in [[Illinois]] and the [[Diocese of Fort Worth (Southern Cone)|Diocese of Fort Worth]] in [[Texas]]—voted to leave ECUSA and affiliate with the Southern Cone. All were subsequently absorbed into the new [[Anglican Church in North America]].

However, some Anglican representatives from the Diocese of Uruguay expressed their support for the inclusion of same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/112756-curas-uruguayos-se-reconocen-gay-a-pesar-de-mantenerse-celibes|title=Curas uruguayos se reconocen gay a pesar de mantenerse célibes|website=LARED21|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil===
{{Main|Igreja Episcopal Anglicana do Brasil }}
The [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]] is characterised by its [[progressive Christianity|progressive]] [[Theology|theological]] views on homosexuality. After the 1998 [[Lambeth]] Conference, the Anglican Church in Brazil decided to promote two national forums on [[human sexuality]], both held in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Its decisions guided the policy. According to the final document, the consensus of the Brazilian Church is that [[human sexuality]] is a gift from [[God]], and it should be experienced in peace, freedom, love and respect. The Church has approved of the ordination of openly gay priests and has offered blessing services for same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guiame.com.br/gospel/mundo-cristao/anglicanos-dividem-opinioes-sobre-homossexualidade.html|title=Anglicanos dividem opiniões sobre homossexualidade, Notícias Gospel|last=Guiame|website=Guiame|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that the [[Christianity|Church]] should respect the privacy of its members and [[clergy]]. Any kind of public exposure of someone's [[sexual orientation]] (as a pre-requisite to be a member or take part of any ministry) violates this privacy. Because of that progressive position, the [[Bishop]] of the Diocese of Recife, still strongly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], Robinson Cavalcanti, declared Recife to be independent of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil|Church of Brazil]], an action that resulted in his being deposed as a bishop by the [[Ecclesiastical Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Orlando Santos de Oliveira, 17 June 2005. [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/dojustice/j311b.html Canonical Trial # 001/2005 of Bishop Edward Robinson de Barros Cavalcanti]. Retrieved 22 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his main reasons, he pointed out that the Brazilian Church was sympathetic to the ordination of [[Gene Robinson]], as well as the ordination of all [[LGBT]] people. This split the Diocese of Recife in two: one part loyal to Bishop Orlando Santos de Oliveira, primate of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], and currently coordinated by Bishop Sebastião Gameleira, and the other, under Cavalcanti's leadership, tied to the [[Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of the Americas|Anglican Church of the Southern Cone]].

In 2003, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|ECUSA]] became the first [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] province to ordain an openly gay priest in a same-sex relationship as a bishop; however, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s stance on [[LGBT]] matters had been debated for decades. In 1976, the Church's [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] passed a resolution stating: "It is the sense of this General Convention that homosexual persons are children of God who have a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;The Archives of the Episcopal Church, [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1976-A069 Acts of Convention: Resolution #1976-A069]. Retrieved 20013-7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the first openly gay and lesbian priest was ordained by Bishop Paul Moore Jr. in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/06/us/lesbian-ordained-episcopal-priest.html|title=LESBIAN ORDAINED EPISCOPAL PRIEST|last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1991-06-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interpretations were held within the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] on this resolution, ranging from the majority of [[diocese]]s that now ordain non-celibate [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] [[clergy]] to the minority group who founded the [[Anglican Communion Network]] which currently opposes such ordinations. On 23 June 2005, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|The Episcopal Church]] defined its meaning in a 130-page document entitled "To Set Our Hope on Christ":
&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe that God has been opening our eyes to acts of God that we had not known how to see before ... the eligibility for ordination of those in covenanted same-sex unions ... a person living in a same-gendered union may be eligible to lead the flock of Christ ... members of the Episcopal Church have discerned holiness in same-sex relationships and have come to support the blessing of such unions and the ordination or consecration of persons in those unions ... Their holiness stands in stark contrast with many sinful patterns of sexuality in the world ... The idea that there is only one correct way to read or interpret scripture is a rather modern idea.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Lawless, Associated Press, 21 June 2005. [http://aacblog.classicalanglican.net/archives/2005_06.html#000759 U.S. Episcopals Defend Openly Gay Bishop]. Accessed 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] voted to allow [[bishop]]s to [[blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|bless same-sex unions]], and also called for bishops to "collect and develop theological and liturgical resources" for possibly creating an [[Wedding|official rite]] for such ceremonies at the 2012 General Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/us/16episcopal.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Episcopal Bishops Give Ground on Gay Marriage | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein | date=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=94111  |title=Gays make advances at Episcopal confab |first=Chuck Colbert |date=24 July 2009 |publisher=[[Edge Media Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the Reverend Mally Lloyd and the Reverend [[Katherine Hancock Ragsdale]], two prominent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priests, married in a [[Wedding|ceremony]] at the [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul (Boston)|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/01/06/Two_Lesbian_Priests_Tie_the_Knot/ Advocate:Two Lesbian Priests Tie the Knot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108005623/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/01/06/Two_Lesbian_Priests_Tie_the_Knot/ |date=8 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the General Convention approved an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions, called “The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,” while making it clear that it was not marriage. The action enabled priests to bestow the church’s blessing on gay couples even in states where same-sex marriage is illegal, subject to the approval of the bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/us/episcopalians-approve-rite-to-bless-same-sex-unions.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |work=The New York Times |title=Episcopalians Approve Rite to Bless Same-Sex Unions |first=Laurie |last=Goodstein |date=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the General Convention approved “canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians.” The canonical change eliminated “language defining marriage as between a man and a woman.” The liturgical change provided two marriage rites for use by same-sex or opposite-sex couples with consent of the priest and permission of the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Episcopal News Service staff, “General Convention wrap-up: Historic actions, structural changes” (July 7, 2015).

The [[Anglican Church in Central America]] consists of five churches representing different Central American countries. Each member church makes many of its own decisions. In 2013, priests and ministries in the Diocese of El Salvador began to advocate for the full inclusion of LGBT members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Anglican Church of Mexico, like the other North American provinces, has expressed in some particular instances more liberal views regarding gender and sexuality. However, Presiding Bishop Francisco Moreno has opposed same-sex unions and the current canons do not provide for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/articulo/anglicanos-y-mormones-contra-matrimonios-gay|title=Anglicanos y mormones contra matrimonios gay|website=Vanguardia|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, then Presiding Bishop Carlos Touché-Porter became a patron of Inclusive Church advocating for '"a liberal, open church which is inclusive of all,' regardless of race, gender or sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/scotland-primus-becomes-co-patron-inclusive-church|title=SCOTLAND: Primus becomes co-patron of Inclusive Church {{!}} Episcopal Church|website=www.episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Presiding Bishop Carlos Touché-Porter also affirmed that Bishop Gene Robinson was not the first gay cleric, but that he was simply being honest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Figueroa|first1=Héctor|title=Habrá obispo mexicana en unos años: Iglesia Anglicana|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2014/07/20/971841|website=excelsior.com.mx|publisher=Excelsior|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the ordination of openly gay clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/archbishops-gay-plea-640318|title=Archbishop's gay plea|last=Qureshi|first=Yakub|date=2007-10-03|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Touché-Porter's diocese, the Diocese of Mexico, "permits clergy in same-sex relationships to serve in the ministry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://geoconger.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/mexico-backs-anglican-covenant-the-church-of-england-newspaper-july-9-2010-p-5/|title=Mexico backs Anglican Covenant: The Church of England Newspaper, July 9, 2010 p 5|date=2010-07-17|website=Conger|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchnewspaper.com/?s=Mexico|title=Mexico backs Anglican Covenant|last=Conger|first=George|date=August 7, 2010|website=churchnewspaper.com|publisher=The Church of England Newspaper|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI approached the Anglican Church with the possibility of joining the Catholic Church over issues of sexuality, then Presiding Bishop Carlos reassured his province that he supported remaining within the Anglican Communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramírez|first1=Mariana Viayra|title=Anglicanos mexicanos rechazan unirse a la Iglesia católica|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2009/467560.html|website=cronica.com.mx|publisher=La Crónica|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglican Church of Southern Africa===
{{Main|Anglican Church of Southern Africa}}

The canon law of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa states that "marriage by divine institution is a lifelong and exclusive union partnership between one man and one woman" and makes no provision for same-sex weddings or for blessing same-sex civil unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anglicanchurchsa.org/canons/chapter-c34-disipline/|title=C34: OF HOLY MATRIMONY – Anglican Church of Southern Africa|website=anglicanchurchsa.org|language=en-ZA|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diocese of Saldanha Bay]] has approved the blessing of same-sex civil unions as a provison on the diocesan level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/churchs-decision-to-bless-same-sex-unions-hailed-17390688|title=Church's decision to bless same-sex unions hailed {{!}} Cape Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the church does not have an official stance on homosexuality itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/3226753.stm|title=Anglican Church around the world|date=2008-07-15|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been reported of current Archbishop Thabo Makgoba that "The Anglican Primate, [is] one among few church leaders in Africa to support same-sex marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/why.this.archbishop.wept.when.his.church.rejected.gays/96936.htm|title=Why This Archbishop Wept When His Church Rejected Same-Sex Blessings {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Makgoba and his working group on human sexuality have proposed a motion “… to amend Canon 34 which will enable ministry to those in Same Sex Unions and the LGBTI Community in the context in which ACSA operates in Southern Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchnewspaper.com/49159/archives|title=South Africa Church plans to amend marriage Canon – ChurchNewspaper.com|website=www.churchnewspaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous archbishop, [[Desmond Tutu]], said that: "The [[Jesus]] I worship is not likely to collaborate with those who vilify and persecute an already oppressed minority&amp;nbsp;[...]. I could not myself keep quiet whilst people were being penalised for something about which they could do nothing, their sexuality. For it is so improbable that any sane, normal person would deliberately choose a lifestyle exposing him or her to so much vilification, opprobrium and physical abuse, even death. To discriminate against our sisters and brothers who are lesbian or gay on grounds of their sexual orientation for me is as totally unacceptable and unjust as Apartheid ever was.&lt;ref&gt;Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 1 February 2004.[http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/12039.htm Sermon at Southwark Cathedral]. Accessed 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;"

Another former archbishop, [[Njongonkulu Ndungane]], has criticised other African churches regarding homosexuality and said that the church's attention should be focused on other concerns such as [[AIDS]] and [[poverty]]. Nevertheless, Ndungane expressed publicly his disapproval of [[same-sex marriage]] when it was legalised in [[South Africa]]: "As far as we are concerned as a church, our understanding of marriage is between a man and a woman. And as a church, and the Anglican Church in particular, we have said no to same-sex unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingattitude.org.uk/archives/2083|title=Archbishop Njongonkulu of Cape Town declares same-sex marriages unchristian 9 December 2004|work=changingattitude.org.uk|access-date=3 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182152/http://changingattitude.org.uk/archives/2083|archive-date=14 July 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016, the bishops of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa voted to affirm members in same-gender marriages as fully equal members of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Additionally, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa does not have an official policy regarding the ordination of openly gay or lesbian clergy and, thus, some may identify as LGBT depending on their diocese.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global trend: World's oldest Protestant churches now ordain gays and lesbians|url=http://www.ucc.org/global-trend-worlds-oldest|website=ucc.org|publisher=United Church of Christ|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, for example, the Rev.

Rev. Mervyn Castle, who is openly gay and celibate, was consecrated suffragan bishop in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYHcK6kWcPAC|title=Aliens in the Household of God: Homosexuality and Christian Faith in South Africa|last=Germond|first=Paul|date=1997-01-01|publisher=New Africa Books|isbn=9780864863300|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, while gay and lesbian clergy may be locally ordained, the national church has not yet developed liturgies to bless same-gender unions.

Nevertheless, the Diocese of Cape Town, in 2009, did vote in favour of recognising same-gender unions pastorally and the diocese committed itself to studying the issue further.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution of the Diocese of Cape Town on Ministry to Gays and Lesbians in Covenanted Partnerships|url=http://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2009/08/resolution-of-diocese-of-cape-town-on.html|website=anglicanchurchsa.org|publisher=Anglican Church of Southern Africa|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote in 2009 "[had] taken a small step towards accepting gay people in 'faithful, committed relationships.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/church-makes-key-decision-on-gay-couples-456065|title=Church makes key decision on gay couples {{!}} IOL|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution also said that it is "Affirming a pastoral response to same-sex partnerships of faithful commitment in our parish families;"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Also in 2009, Archbishop Thabo Makgoba said that "[g]ays and lesbians can be leaders within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa as long as they remain celibate, its synod of bishops has declared."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/sexual-orientation-no-barrier-to-church-leadership-in-southern-africa-8688|title=Sexual orientation no barrier to church leadership in Southern Africa|website=www.anglicanjournal.com|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Provincial Synod adopted a resolution that "urged its bishops to provide guidelines for giving pastoral care to same-sex couples who have entered civil unions under South African law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/southern-africa-church-considers-pastoral-response-civil-unions|title=Southern Africa: Church considers pastoral response to civil unions|date=2013-10-04|work=Episcopal Church|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution also:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2013/10/anglican-church-of-southern-africa-considers-pastoral-response-to-civil-unions.aspx|title=Anglican Church of Southern Africa considers Pastoral Response to Civil Unions|website=www.anglicannews.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Bishop Raphael Hess of Sadanha Bay gave permission for an Anglican priest to officiate at a service of celebration for the Rev. Mpho Tutu and her partner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When Tutu surrendered her licence to avoid controversy, Bishop Hess stated that he "hoped it would be short-lived" and that he is proposing to change policy to welcome her back. Her father, Desmond Tutu, gave "a father's blessing".&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;

Currently, priests may not enter into a same-sex marriage, but the church does allow "same-sex relationships if they are celibate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/09/mpho-tutu-van-furth-its-painful-to-step-down-from-my-priestly-ministry|title=Desmond Tutu's daughter: 'painful' to give up ministry after marrying woman|last=correspondent|first=Harriet Sherwood Religion|date=2016-06-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2016, Archbishop Makgoba said "we also tried at the Synod of Bishops to draw up guidelines for clergy wanting to bless couples in same-sex unions, or who want to enter same-sex unions themselves ...

He said the issue might hopefully be taken up again at the next provincial synod in 2019. He also said the issue could be discussed at the local level in parishes and dioceses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Makgoba further noted how relatively liberal the province is saying "As it was, the degree of support for the motion was quite substantial if you compare us to other African provinces of the Anglican Church, most of which are vigorously opposed to same-sex unions in any form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org/2016/10/the-anglican-church-of-southern-africas.html|title=The Anglican Church of Southern Africa's debate on human sexuality - Archbishop Thabo Makgoba|website=archbishop.anglicanchurchsa.org|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also voiced his support for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/why.this.archbishop.wept.when.his.church.rejected.gays/96936.htm|title=Why This Archbishop Wept When His Church Rejected Same-Sex Blessings {{!}} Christian News on Christian Today|website=www.christiantoday.com|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pastoral letter published on March 2, 2017, the Bench of Bishops said that they continue to discuss "the Pastoral Guidelines for ministry to those in same-sex relationships, which are still incomplete.

{{Main|Anglican Church of Tanzania}}
In November 2003, responding to the consecration of [[Bishop]] [[Gene Robinson]], [[Archbishop]] [[Donald Mtetemela]] stated his belief that homosexuality is against [[Bible|biblical]] teaching: "The Anglican Church of Tanzania believes that homosexuality is contrary to the teaching of the Word of God. It is a sin."&lt;ref name="Tanzania"&gt;Afrol News, 13 November 2003. [http://www.afrol.com/articles/10473 Church of Tanzania breaks ties with US church]. Retrieved 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mtetemela declared that the [[Anglican Church of Tanzania|Church of Tanzania]] was no longer in communion with [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] bishops who participated in the [[consecration]] of Robinson, and those who permit the [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessing of same-sex unions]].&lt;ref name="Tanzania"/&gt;

===Church of the Province of Uganda===
{{Main|Church of Uganda|l1=Church of the Province of Uganda}}
The Ugandan church cut ties with its North American counterparts over homosexuality. It declared itself in full communion with the [[Anglican Church in North America]], a denomination not recognised by the Anglican Communion that was formed by lay and [[clergy]] members who had left [[Episcopal Church (United States)|The Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] over matters of [[LGBT]] inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acnaassembly.org/index2.php/acna/page/109 |title=Church of Uganda Declares itself in Full Communion with Anglican Church in North America |author=Church of Uganda |publisher=Anglican Church in North America |accessdate=11 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628104434/http://www.acnaassembly.org/index2.php/acna/page/109 |archivedate=28 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Archbishop Orombi, then the leader of the Church of Uganda, criticised the Church of England for permitting priests to enter into same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2013, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali maintained opposition to clergy in civil unions opposing the Church of England's decision to allow bishops to register a civil partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1312365/ntagali-attacks-church-england-gay-bishops|title=Ntagali attacks Church of England over gay bishops|newspaper=www.newvision.co.ug|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Ntagali stated that “to allow clergy in civil partnerships to be eligible to become Bishops is really no different from allowing gay Bishops.  This decision violates our Biblical faith and agreements within the Anglican Communion.”&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchnewspaper.com/30492/archives|title=African outrage over civil partnership decision|last=Conger|first=George|date=January 16, 2013|website=churchnewspaper.com|access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ntagali compared England's decision to those made in other western Anglican provinces. “Sadly we must also declare that if the Church of England continues in this contrary direction we must further separate ourselves from it and we are prepared to take the same actions as those prompted by the decisions of The Episcopal Church (USA) and the Anglican Church of Canada ten years ago.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Church of Melanesia ===
{{Main|Church of Melanesia}}In 1998, the Council of Bishops requested that the Rt Rev Terry Brown "draft a study paper on homosexuality for the Church of Melanesia&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/dojustice/j194.html|title=Further Reflections on Homosexuality, Christian Faith and the Church|last=Brown|first=Terry|date=2000|website=rci.rutgers.edu|publisher=Rutgers|access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bishop Terry Brown, a former Bishop of Malaita reflected on his experience "as an 'out' gay man serving as bishop".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.episcopalcafe.com/another_gay_bishop/|title=Another Gay bishop|date=2007-09-07|website=Episcopal Cafe|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220091332/http://www.episcopalcafe.com/another_gay_bishop/|archivedate=20 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church ===
{{Main|Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church}}

On March 22, 2017, the Synod of the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church released a statement of support expressing its solidarity with the [[Spanish Evangelical Church]] after the latter had accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/religion/espana/2017/03/22/religion-iglesia-confesiones-espana-madrid-los-anglicanos-se-solidarizan-con-la-iglesia-evangelica-espanola.shtml|title=Los anglicanos se solidarizan con la Iglesia Evangélica Española|last=Madrid|first=Ministros anglicanos de|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In supporting the Spanish Evangelical Church, the Episcopal Synod joined LGBT advocacy groups by protesting its removal from the Evangelical Council of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://protestantedigital.com/ciudades/41763/Solidaridad_de_IERE_y_colectivos_LGTB_con_la_IEE_en_contra_del_CEM|title=Anglicanos y colectivos LGTB apoyan una iglesia inclusiva dentro del CEM|website=protestantedigital|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}{{For|the video game|Hylics (video game)}}
'''Hylic''' (from Greek {{lang|grc|ύλη}}  (''hylē'') "matter") is the opposite of psychic (from Greek {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} (''psychē'') "soul").

In the [[gnostic]] belief system, '''hylics''', also called '''somatics''' (from Gk {{lang|grc|σώμα}} (''sōma'') "body"), were the lowest order of the three types of [[human]]. The other two were the psychics and the [[pneumatic (Gnosticism)|pneumatics]] (from Gk {{lang|grc|πνεύμα}} (''pneuma'') "spirit, breath"). So humanity comprised matter-bound beings, matter-dwelling spirits and the matter-free or immaterial souls.

Somatics were deemed completely bound to matter. Matter, the material world, was considered evil by the gnostics. The material world was created by a [[demiurge]], in some instances a blind, mad God, in others an army of rebellious [[angel]]s as a trap for the spiritual [[Simon Magus#Myth of Simon and Helen|Ennoia]]. The duty of (spiritual) man was to escape the material world by the aid of the hidden knowledge (gnosis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freke|first=Timothy|title=Jesus and the Lost Goddess: The Secret Teachings of the Original Christians|year=2001|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-1-4000-4594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somatics were human in form, but since their entire focus was on the material world, such as eating, sleeping, mating or creature comforts, they were seen as doomed. The pneumatic saw himself as escaping the doom of the material world via the secret knowledge. Somatics were thought to be incapable of understanding.

For consideration of these dynamics, see for example the [[Gospel of Judas]], believed to be a gnostic text, where Jesus is posited as a pneumatic and the other disciples, non-gnostics, as somatics.

[[File:Kannushi and miko at the Meiji Shrine, Tokyo.jpg|thumb|180px|left|A ''kannushi'' wearing a ''[[jōe]]'' accompanied by a ''[[miko]]'']]
[[File:Shinto_priest_in_full_dress,kannushi,katori-jingu-shrine,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|180px|right|A ''kannushi'' in full dress, [[Katori Shrine]]]]
[[File:Kannushi Kamakura.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A ''kannushi'' wearing a garment called ''kariginu'' and a hat called ebōshi]]

A {{nihongo3|"god master"|神主|'''kannushi'''|originally pronounced ''kamunushi''}}, also called {{nihongo|'''shinshoku'''|神職|extra=meaning ''god's employee''}}, is the person responsible for the maintenance of a {{nihongo|[[Shinto]] [[shinto shrine|shrine]]|神社|''jinja''}} as well as for leading worship of a given ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;* ''Kannushi'' (in Japanese), Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version&lt;/ref&gt;
The characters for ''kannushi'' are sometimes also read '''''jinshu''''' with the same meaning.

Originally the ''kannushi'' were intermediaries between ''kami'' and could transmit their will to common humans.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;  A ''kannushi'' was a man capable of miracles or a holy man who, because of his practice of [[Harae|purificatory rites]], was able to work as a medium for a [[kami]]. Later the term evolved to being synonymous with ''shinshoku'', that is, a man who works at a shrine and holds religious ceremonies there.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ya"&gt;
{{cite web |last = Moriyasu |first = Jin |title = Kannushi |language = Japanese |work = Nihon Hyakka Zensho |publisher = Shogakukan |url = http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%BB/ |accessdate = 2009-10-16 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AfIob8e3?url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%BB/ |archivedate = 2012-09-14 |df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, because of the overlap of political and religious power within a clan, it was the head of the clan who led the clansmen during religious functions, or else it could be another official.&lt;ref name="ya"/&gt; Later, the role evolved into a separate and more specialized form. The term appears in both the ''[[Kojiki]]'' (680 AD) and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720 AD).&lt;ref name="ya"/&gt; In them respectively, Empress Jungū and Emperor Suijin become ''kannushi''.&lt;ref name="eos"&gt;
{{cite web | title= Kannushi | last= Nishimuta | first= Takao | date= 2007-03-28 | work= Encyclopedia of Shinto | publisher= Kokugakuin | url= http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1285 | accessdate= 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the same shrine, for example at [[Ise Jingū]] or [[Ōmiwa Shrine]], there can be different types of ''kannushi'' at the same time called for example {{nihongo|''Ō-kannushi''|大神主}}, {{nihongo|''Sō-kannushi''|総神主}}, or {{nihongo|''Gon-kannushi''|権神主}}.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ya"/&gt;

''Kannushi'' can marry and their children usually inherit their position.&lt;ref name="nishi"&gt;
{{cite book | last= Nishimura | first= Hajime | title= A Comparative History of Ideas | publisher= Motilal Banarsidass | year= 1998 | isbn= 978-81-208-1004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although this hereditary status is no longer legally granted, it continues in practice.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;
{{cite web| title= Shinshoku | publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/540847/shinshoku | accessdate= 2009-10-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothes they wear, for example the ''[[jōe]]'', the ''ebōshi'' and the ''kariginu'' (see photos), do not have any special religious significance, but are simply official garments used in the past by the Imperial court.&lt;ref name="nishi"/&gt; This detail reveals the close connection between ''kami'' worship and the figure of the Emperor.&lt;ref name="nishi"/&gt; Other implements used by ''kannushi'' include a baton called ''[[Shaku (Japanese ritual baton)|shaku]]'' and a wand decorated with white paper streamers (''[[shide (Shinto)|shide]]'') called ''[[ōnusa]]''. ''Kannushi'' are assisted in their religious or clerical work by women called ''[[miko]]''.

To become a ''kannushi'', a novice must study at a university approved by the {{Nihongo|[[Association of Shinto Shrines]]|神社本庁|Jinja Honchō}}, typically [[Tokyo]]'s [[Kokugakuin University]] or [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]'s [[Kogakkan University]], or pass an exam that will certify his qualification.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; [[Women in Japan|Women]] can also become ''kannushi'' and widows can succeed their husbands in their job.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10373">In [[Scientology]], the '''security check''' (or '''sec check''') is an interrogation technique put into practice by founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="raine"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raine|first=Susan|year=2009|title=Surveillance in New Religious Movements: Scientology as a Case Study|journal=Religious Studies and Theology|publisher=Equinox Publishing|volume=28|issue=1|pages=63–94|issn=1747-5414|doi=10.1558/rsth.v28i1.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves an "[[Ethics officer (Scientology)|Ethics officer]]" probing the thoughts, attitudes and behavior of an individual member by asking them large numbers of questions.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; The bulk of the questions deal with [[crime|criminal]] or [[sexual activity]] or intentions, or other things that the interviewee might be ashamed of.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper|first=Paulette|title=The Scandal of Scientology|publisher=Tower Publications|location=New York|year=1971|pages=85–92|oclc=921001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt; The questions also probe negative thoughts that the person might have about Scientology or Hubbard.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt; As with traditional [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], the subject holds the electrodes of the [[E-meter]], a simple lie-detector device that measures electrical conductivity in the human body, while they are given a series of highly probing, personal questions.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=June 2006|title=Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=74|issue=2|pages=356–389|issn=1477-4585|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard described security checking as a remedy for "unreasonable action", specifically "the compulsion or obsession to commit actions" the person feels must be kept secret.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary|publisher=Church of Scientology of California, Publications Organization|location=California|year=1975|isbn=0-88404-037-2|oclc=11210573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Checks are given to all Scientologists on the [[Bridge to Total Freedom]], every six months to all [[Operating Thetan]]s, according to officials, "to make sure they're using the tech correctly",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first = Janet | last = Reitman | title = Inside Scientology | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology/print | publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 23 February 2006 | accessdate = 2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to members who are leaving staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first = Robert | last = Farley | title = The unperson | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/25/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml | work =  [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 25 June 2006 | accessdate = 2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a "Code of Reform" issued in 1968, Hubbard announced that he was cancelling security checks, along with the policies of [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]] and [[Disconnection]].&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron  (29 November 1968) "Code of Reform" reproduced in {{Cite book|title = Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand and any associated scientology organisation or bodies in New Zealand; report of the Commission of Inquiry| first= Sir Guy Richardson |last=Powles |author2=E. V. Dumbleton  |date=30 June 1969|oclc=147661 |location=Wellington|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later Scientology documents refer to the practice, and former members report that it still continues.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt;

Sec Checks are also known in the [[Scientology Justice]] system as "Integrity Processing" or "Confessional Auditing".&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt;

==Security checks==
A security check resembles the [[confessional]] in traditional religions.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; However, it also differs from them in that it is not voluntary.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; Hubbard told security checkers that "you are not merely an observer, or an auditor, you are a detective."&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;

Susan Raine of the [[University of Alberta]] observes that the questions asked in security checks show that L. Ron Hubbard was intensely preoccupied with scrutiny, surveillance and betrayal.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; She notes that this intense form of surveillance makes sense from a [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] perspective as a way of making sure all individuals follow (and internalize) the organisational goals.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; Bent Corydon, an ex-Scientologist, compares security checking to the use of [[thought police]] in the novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]].&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; He writes that Scientologists are punished for having negative thoughts about Hubbard or Scientology and so learn to think only positively.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; David Mayo, another former member, reported that sec checks included the question, "Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?" and that such "discreditable thoughts" could land a follower in trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Russell|title=Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard |publisher=Michael Joseph|year=1987|page=289|isbn=0-7181-2764-1|oclc=20634668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the South African Commission of Enquiry published a report on Scientology. It recommended that there should be legislation against sec checks. However, no legislative action was taken as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed |publisher = Lyle Stuart / Carol Publishing Group|isbn=0-8184-0499-X |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HGC Pre-processing Security Check===
HGC stands for "Hubbard Guidance Centre". Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] quotes some questions from this security check dating from 1961.&lt;ref name="wallis"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (23 October 1961) HCO Policy Letter, "HGC Pre-processing security check" quoted in {{Cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=[[The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology]]|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books|location=London|year=1976|page=149|isbn=0-435-82916-5|oclc=310565311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Are you a pervert?
:Are you guilty of any major crimes in this lifetime?
:Have you been sent here knowingly to injure Scientology?
:Are you or have you ever been a Communist?&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wallis" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Johannesburg Security Check===
The Johannesburg (also known as "Joburg") Security Check  was described by Hubbard as "the roughest security check in Scientology". An amended form continued to be used for some time thereafter.&lt;ref name=Atack&gt;Jon Atack, ''A Piece of Blue Sky'', Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst Hubbard's list of primarily crime-related questions is the question "Have you ever slept with a member of a race of another color?"&lt;ref name=HCOPLjoburg&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, ''HCOPL 7 April 1961'', "Johannesburg Security Check"&lt;/ref&gt; Other questions include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Have you ever embezzled money?
:Have you ever been a drug addict?
:Have you ever bombed anything?
:Have you ever murdered anyone?
:Have you ever raped anyone?
:Have you ever had anything to do with a baby farm?&lt;ref name=HCOPLjoburg/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Only Valid Security Check===
The contents of the Joburg security check were later revised into what became "The Only Valid Security Check". Added to the Sec Check are new questions such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Do you collect sexual objects?
:Do you have a secret you are afraid I'll find out?
:Are you upset by this security check?
:Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (1961) "The Only Valid Security Check" Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter, 22 May 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Auditor's Sec Check===
This sec check, comprising 170 questions, was meant for staff auditors and field auditors.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Kevin Victor|author2=Board of Inquiry into Scientology|title=Report of the Board of Inquiry into Scientology (Parliamentary paper 1-6502/65)|publisher=State of Victoria|location=Melbourne|year=1965|oclc=152418521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Do you hope you won't be found out?
:Do you think there is anything wrong with having your privacy invaded?
:What do you wish you hadn't done?
:Are you upset by this security check? &lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (1961) "Auditor's Sec Check" Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter, 7 July 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Security Check Children===
Designed to be applied to children aged 6 to 12. Issued by Hubbard as HCO Bulletin of 21 September 1961, also known as ''HCO WW Security Form 8''. The procedure runs through 99 questions, such as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:What has somebody told you not to tell?
:Have you ever decided you didn't like some member of your family?
:Have you ever taken something belonging to somebody else and never given it back?
:Have you ever pretended to be sick (ill)?
:Have you ever made yourself sick (ill) or hurt yourself to make somebody sorry?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Whole Track Security Check===
This long Sec Check, consisting of hundreds of questions, takes stock of the subject's entire time track, including their "recollections" of any "[[Reincarnation#Scientology|past lives]]" they believe they have had. It includes questions such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?
:Have you ever smothered a baby?
:Have you ever enslaved a population?
:Have you ever destroyed a culture?
:Have you ever torn out someone's tongue?
:Have you ever zapped anyone?
:Have you ever eaten a human body?
:Have you ever made a planet, or nation, radioactive?&lt;ref name=Atack/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversy==

===Potential blackmail===

Scientology researcher [[Jon Atack]] — a critic of Scientology, and himself a former Scientologist  — explains in his book ''A Piece of Blue Sky'' that sec checks could be applied either as a "confidential" Confessional or as a non-confidential investigation. He alleges that former members have been silenced by the fear that their "confidential" secrets will be used in blackmail against them.

&lt;!--Please only include examples of miraculous births in faith-based, legendary, or mythological traditions. Do NOT include births of non-spiritual figures.--&gt;

Stories of '''miraculous births''' often include conceptions by [[miracle|miraculous]] circumstances and features such as intervention by a [[deity]], [[supernatural]] elements, [[Astronomy|astronomical]] signs, hardship or, in the case of some mythologies, complex plots related to creation.

==Near Eastern mythology==
The [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n concept of origins expressed procreation first in “relationships between gods and goddesses resulting in other gods and goddesses," such as [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]] and [[Damkina]] assisted by [[Apsu]] giving birth to [[Marduk]]. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' describes the birth of Marduk as follows: "Ea, having overheard the plan of the primordial deities to destroy the other gods, deceived [[Apsu]] and [[Mummu]] and put them to death. 'Ea, his triumph over his enemies secured, in his sacred chamber in profound peace he rested.' (ANET, p.&amp;nbsp;61, lines 74—75.)  Then he took over the place which Apsu had used for his cult and dwelt there with his spouse, Damkina."

According to [[Norman Lockyer]], Ea, Ia, or [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]] was the primal god of Babylon. He was a ‘Great God, Maker of Men, Potter, Artist and Workman.’  He formed a Triad with [[Anu]] and [[Bil]]—the two poles of heaven and the equator.&lt;ref name="Lockyer, Norman, Sir"&gt;Lockyer, Norman, The dawn of astronomy : a study of temple worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians.

He was believed to have been "reincarnated" several times.

{{Further|Myth of Osiris and Isis|Horus}}
[[File:Abydos Tempelrelief Sethos I. 36.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Isis, in the form of a bird, copulates with the deceased Osiris.

&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The belief in the conception of [[Horus]] by [[Isis]] is traced to the beginning of Egyptian history.  Horus' conception and birth were understood in terms of the Egyptian doctrine of [[parthenogenesis]], which was connected with the goddess Neith of Sais. (page 220)&lt;ref name="Budge, E. A. Wallis"&gt;[[Budge, E. A. Wallis]], ''The Gods of the Egyptians'', II, Dover Publications, New York, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;  In Upper Egypt, Net was worshipped at Seni and represented with the head of a lioness painted green, with the titles: "Father of fathers and Mother of mothers," and "net-Menhit, the great lady, lady of the south, the great cow who gave birth to the sun, who made the germ of gods and men, the mother of [[Ra]], who raised up [[Atum|Tem]] in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and who created that which exists after she had come into being."(page 150)&lt;ref name="Erman, Adolf"&gt;Erman, Adolf, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, B. Blom, New York, 1971, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many of the attributes of Isis, the God-mother, the mother of Horus; and of [[Neith]], the goddess of [[Sais]] are identical with those of Mary the Mother of Christ." (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  Early Christian stories in the [[Apocrypha]]l Gospels, which record the wanderings of the Virgin and Child in Egypt are similar to stories found on the [[Metternich Stela]] texts about the life of Isis. (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; Also, the pictures and sculptures of Isis suckling her child Horus are the foundation for Christian figurines and paintings of the Madonna and Child.  Of course, the legend of the birth of Horus has many elements not found even in the Apocryphal Gospels.  Egyptian texts mention numerous forms of Horus.  In one he is "Heru-sa Ast, sa-Asar, or Horus, son of Isis, son of [[Osiris]]."  Isis is described in the Hymn to Osiris, as finding and restoring the body of her dead husband, and using magical words given her by [[Thoth]] to restore him to life.  Then, by uniting with Osiris she conceives Horus.  Horus represented the rising sun and in this respect was comparable to the Greek [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="hammerwood.mistral.com.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerwood.mistral.co.uk/apollo.htm |title=Apollo.

National Curriculum: Ancient Greece, Greeks |publisher=Hammerwood.mistral.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were at least fifteen other Horuses in the Egyptian pantheon,&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/horus.htm |title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Horus |publisher=Egyptianmyths.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in the story of Isis and Osiris Horus is "sometimes known as Harsiesis, to distinguish him from the others.  He is depicted as a falcon, or with a falcon's head.  He eventually avenged Osiris' death and reclaimed the throne, ruling peacefully...Herakhty, or 'Horus of the Horizon', was a sun god who rose each morning on the eastern horizon.  He was often identified with the sun god, Ra, and was eventually absorbed by him, forming Ra-Herakhty."&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"/&gt;

Lineal descent from Ra, whether by birth or by marriage, was claimed by all kings of Egypt at least since User-ka-f, first king of the V Dynasty, who was high priest of Ra at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  An important part of this tradition was the legend of the God Re generating with the wife of a priest.  "The newborn child was regarded as a god incarnate, and later with appropriate ceremonies he was presented to [[Ra|Re]] or Amen-Re, in his temple, where the god accepted it and acknowledged it to be his child."  This tradition was later inscribed in a stereotyped form in temple reliefs.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

Many texts mention different attributes of Isis.  These were combined into a single narrative by [[Plutarch]] in the 1st century AD. In her aspect of protector of Egypt and its people, Isis is depicted with huge outspread wings.  She taught women to grind corn, to spin and to weave, and she taught the people how to cure illnesses. She instituted the rite of marriage.  When her consort, Osiris, left Egypt to travel the world, Isis ruled the country in his absence.  "The [[hieroglyph]] for her name is the image of a throne, and her lap came to be seen as the throne of Egypt.  Because of her fame Isis eventually absorbed the qualities of almost all the other goddesses; "she was a great mother goddess, a bird goddess, a goddess of the underworld who brought life to the dead, and a goddess of the primeval waters...Her following spread beyond Egypt to Greece and throughout the Roman Empire...(lasting) from before 3000 BC until well into Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/isis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/culture/isis.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharaohs===
{{Further|Stories of divine birth in the eighteenth dynasty}}
There is a myth on the birth of [[Hatshepsut]]. In this myth, [[Amun]] goes to [[Queen Ahmose]] in the form of the Pharaoh [[Thutmose I]] and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ''[[ankh]]'', a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Robins, ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', Harvard University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth on divine birth concerns [[Amenhotep III]]: he is conceived by [[Amun]] which has gone to queen [[Mutemwiya]] in form of [[Thutmosis IV]].&lt;ref&gt;O' Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.: ''Amenhotep III:Perspectives of his reign'', University of Michigan Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce: ''Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew Bible, and in later Jewish tradition there are stories of matriarchs giving birth where the God of Israel miraculously intervenes. For example, within the Rabbinic literature expansions were made on the birth of the matriarch [[Sarah]] on the earlier Old Testament traditions.

===Isaac===
{{Main|Isaac|Sarah}}
[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. À Paris chez Fr. Fanet, Éditeur, Rue des Saints Pères n° 10. 18th century. Sarah is seen on the left side, looking]]
Due to her old age, Sarai was infertile, but a miracle was vouchsafed to her ([[Genesis Rabbah]] xlvii. 3) after her name was changed from "Sarai" to "Sarah" (R. H. 16b). When her youth had been restored and she had given birth to [[Isaac]] the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notables to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, who brought their infants with them, and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle (B. M. 87a; comp. Gen. R. liii. 13).

===Immanuel===
According to [[Isaiah 7:14]], around 735 BC King [[Ahaz]] of Judah received a message from the prophet [[Isaiah]] during the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] with Aram (Syria) and Israel, "Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938/showrashi/true |title=Yeshayahu - Chapter 7 - Texts &amp; Writings |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally taken by Judaic commentators to be a reference to the non-miraculous birth of [[Hezekiah]] or another contemporary child, as indicated in Isaiah's following indication of the timing.

The Greek [[Septuagint]] and some later Christian translations, following the application of Isaiah 7 in Matthew 1, use the word "virgin". The Hebrew word ''alma'' actually translates as a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, whereas the Hebrew ''betulah'', used elsewhere in Isaiah, is the word that means "virgin." If the reference is to Ahaz's betrothed, [[Abijah (queen)|Abi]], daughter of the [[High Priest]], no miraculous birth is implied, merely chastity. The Christian world believes that the verse is a messianic prediction of the miraculous birth of Jesus, as described in various gospels of the New Testament of the Bible.

===Melchizedek===
The [[Second Book of Enoch]] contains a section, called ''Exaltation of Melchizedek'', which says that [[Melchizedek]] was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of [[Noah]]. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on the bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel [[Gabriel]] ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in some manuscripts) to the [[Garden of Eden]] and was thus preserved from the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]] without having to be in [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |title=THE SECOND BOOK OF ENOCH - Page 7 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129084437/http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |archivedate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Book of the Secrets of Enoch| author= Morfill, W R (translator)| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3678772/The-Book-of-the-Secrets-of-Enoch-WR-Morfill  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroaster==
{{Further|Zoroastrianism|Zoroaster}}
Zoroaster’s name has been adopted from the Greek and [[Latin]] Zoroastres.  The ancient form of his name in the Avesta is [[Zarathustra]].  His native country was probably [[Median Empire|Media]] in Western Iran, (possibly in modern [[Azerbaijan]]), but his ministry took place in eastern Iran, especially in the region of [[Bactria]], about 1200 BC. [[Zoroaster]] was originally a Magian priest, and under the reforms he instituted, Mithra became one of the [[Yazata]]s (Worshipful Ones), the angels or lesser divine beings.

"It was said that (Zoroaster's) birth was foretold from the beginning of time, and that the moment he was born, he burst out laughing and the whole universe rejoiced with him."  After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of [[Zoroaster]]’s seed.  "The central scripture, the [[Avesta]] and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra."  Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by a shaft of light.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"&gt;Egyptian mythology, Lorenz, London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman and Hellenistic mythology==
===Gods===
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerva.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Birth of [[Minerva]]'' by [[René-Antoine Houasse]] (before 1688)]]

[[Greco-Roman]] and [[Hellenistic]] literature is rich in the tradition of birth among the gods. In his poem ''[[Theogony]]'', the Greek poet [[Hesiod]] tells a story that Zeus had once lain with the goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], impregnating her, but, fearing that she might bear a child mightier than he himself, he swallowed her.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 886&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter [[Athena]] was born fully grown from Zeus's forehead, fully armed and clad in armor.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 929a&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod also relates that the goddess [[Aphrodite]] was born from the foam of the sea after [[Ouranos]]'s castrated testicles were thrown into it.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helios]] was a child of Zeus by [[Euryphaessa]].  He was also called "the son of Earth and starry Heaven," and the son of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]]. [[Dionysus]] was dithyrambus, "he who entered life by a double door." His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus appeared to her in a flash of lightning, and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant.  In time, Dionysus was born "perfect" from Zeus' thigh.  Dionysus [[Zagreus]] was important in Orphic theology. In Protrepticus ii. 14 ff. by Clement of Alexandria, this child had the form of a bull.  Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him.  Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed.  According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus.  Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

===Mithra and Mithras===
{{Main|Mithras|Mithra|Mitra}}
[[File:MithrasIMG 5339.JPG|thumb|right|325px|Roman statue showing Mithras born from the rock from the Diocletian Baths Museum]]

In Indian mythology, [[Mithra]] is known as Mitra.  He was originally a god of contracts and friendship and was a forerunner of the Graeco-Roman god [[Mithras]].  In [[Iran]], he developed into the protector of truth.  Before the time of Zoroaster, he was associated with [[Ahura Mazda]], the principle of good. As a consequence of Zoroaster's reforms to Iranian religion, Mithra was ousted from power and Ahura Mazda became supreme.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  In the more ancient Indian [[Vedas]] Mithra was the god of light, invoked under the name of [[Varuna]], and was called "the Light of the World." He was the mediator between heaven and Earth.

"The light bursting from the heavens, which were conceived as a solid vault, became, in the mythology of the [[Magi]], Mithra born from the rock."&lt;ref name="Boerie, C. George, Dr."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/romanempire.html |title=The Roman Empire |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithraism absorbed [[astrology]] from the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]] after the Chaldean conquest, and continued as an astronomical religion.  In the Hellenistic period it took on its final form.  Mithra was assimilated into [[Graeco-Roman]] beliefs in the 1st century BC as Mithras.  He was an ancient and highly honored god of [[Roman mythology|Roman]] Paganism, where he was worshipped for more than 300 years as "the soldier's god."&lt;ref name="Newadvent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10402a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Mithraism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological heroes===
[[File:Danae gold shower Louvre CA925.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Boeotia]]n [[bell-krater]] showing Zeus impregnating [[Danaë]] in the form of a shower of gold, circa 450-425 BC]]

The love of a god for a mortal, resulting in the birth of a hero, is one notable deviation from the tradition of the origin of gods. The legend of [[Perseus]], whose mother conceived him when [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] came to her in the form of a golden shower, is one example of this type (cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV).  The ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' has the following: [[Zeus]], turned to gold, piercing the brazen chamber of Danae, cut the knot of intact virginity.

Heroes created by generation of a god with a mortal include [[Ion (play)|Ion]] by Apollo and [[Creusa]], [[Romulus]] by Mars and Aemila, [[Asclepius]] by Apollo and [[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] by Zeus and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]].   [[Plutarch]] records how Theseus and [[Romulus]] were both born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage and at the same time had the reputation of being sprung from the gods.  He said that Theseus' grandfather [[Pittheus]] invented the story that Theseus was the child of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] to conceal Theseus' lineage as the son of Pittheus' daughter [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]] and [[Aegeus]] ("Lives", Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;2; pp.&amp;nbsp;3 ff.).  But there were other stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus.  The story of Romulus' divine origin says that his mother was the mortal daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, and his father was Mars.

In his "Hymn to Asclepius", [[Homer]] attributes his origin to the god Apollo and the daughter of a renowned soldier, King Phlegyas.  As the divine patron of the healing art, [[Asclepius]] became the most popular of the hero gods of Greece.  The belief that religion was concerned with sickness and disease was central to his cult.  His sanctuaries in the Greco-Roman world became so famous there was a movement to make him a god of the first rank and identify him with Zeus himself.  Asclepius was "the one who leads and controls all things, the savior of the whole world, and the guardian of mortals."

Helen of Troy was worshiped as a heroine in several parts of the ancient world during the early historical epoch.  [[Euripides]]' play "Helen" depends on a tradition begun in the early 6th century B.C. by the Greek poet Stesichorus that Helen was the daughter of Zeus (who took the form of a swan) and Leda.  But this might simply be a poetic way of saying that she was hatched from an egg.

There are two versions of the birth of [[Oedipus]].  He was given a semidivine status in [[Sophocles]]' "Oedipus the King," where he was said to be the son of either [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], Loxias, "or the Bacchants' god, dweller on the hilltops ..." and one of the nymphs of Helicon.  But in Euripides' "Phoenissae," his mother, Jocasta, says Oedupus is the son of Laius, a mortal, who was warned by the god Phoebus not to have children.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"King of Thebes for horses famed! seek not to beget children against the will of heaven; for if thou beget a son, that child will slay thee, and all thy house shall wade in blood."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laius ignored the warning, but after the child was born he gave him to shepherds to expose on Mount Cithaeron.  The child was found and raised among the keepers of the horses of Polybus.  As a grown man, Oedipus did indeed kill his father, not realizing who he was, and then married his mother.  When he discovered the truth he blinded himself.  In this story, he is clearly considered to be the son of Laius and Jocasta.  This is also obvious in Sophocles' "Oedipus the King".&lt;ref name="Eds. Oates and O'Neill"&gt;The Complete Greek Drama, Eds. Oates and O'Neill, Vol. 1, p. 409, Random House, New York, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Boslooper, "The two passages indicate that in the Greek mind the thoughts of divine and human paternal participation in conception were not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;178)

[[File:Mignard - The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife'' by [[Nicolas Mignard]] (1654)]]

[[Romulus and Remus]], the legendary twin founders of the city of [[Rome]], were said to have been born to a [[Vestal Virgin]], [[Rhea Silvia]].  Rhea Silvia had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin against her will and claimed to have been impregnated through divine intervention.  [[Livy]] attests that she was instead raped by an unknown man.  In any case [[Amulius|King Amulius]] ordered the twins to be drowned as death through the elements would not trigger divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/|title=Romulus and Remus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical figures===
Alexander, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars were said by some scholars to have been "virgin-born."  [[Alexander the Great]], " journeyed to the Oasis of Amon in order that he might be recognized as the god’s son and thus become a legitimate and recognized king of Egypt.  Inscriptions show that he and the [[Ptolemies]] after him had the incidents of their birth regularly depicted in temple reliefs.”&lt;ref name="Breasted"&gt;Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. 2, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; (As cited by Boslooper)  Norden calls this the Hellenistic virgin motif.  However, evidence shows that Alexander must have had a double tradition of origin.  It is recorded that "Alexander the Great and Augustus are deemed to have been conceived of a serpent god, and they claimed between them [[Phoebus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as their progenitors."&lt;ref name="Sidonius Apollinaris"&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina II, 121, Testimonies 289 in Asclepius, E. J. and Ludwig Edelstein (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Emperor [[Augustus]] was praised as the Savior of the world …[but] the idea of Savior was not unique or original with Augustus himself.  Before him the same title was given to [[Seleucid]] and other Hellenistic kings.  Throughout this period there were frequent longings for a savior from the present troubles.”  Augustus was said to have had a miraculous birth and a childhood filled with many portents and signs.  A few months before he was born a portent was observed at Rome which gave warning that nature was pregnant with a king for the Roman People.  "Thereupon the Senate in consternation decreed that no male child born that year should be reared; but those whose wives were with child saw to it that the decree was not filed in the treasury, since each one appropriated the prediction to his own family."  Boslooper relates several additional stories.  In one, Suetonius narrates what he learned from Asclepias of Mendes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When Atia had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of Apollo, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the rest of the matrons also slept.  On a sudden a serpent glided up to her and shortly went away.  When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in colors like a serpent, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently she ceased ever to go to the public baths.  In the tenth month after that Augustus was born and was therefore regarded as the son of Apollo.  Atia too, before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while Octavius dreamed that the sun rose from Atia's womb."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p. 180)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The hope for a savior was expressed in [[Virgil]]’s “Fourth Eclogue".  The Church fathers later claimed this was a reference to Jesus Christ, however, the poem was dedicated to Pollio, one of the great influential men at the time of the civil wars and Virgil's patron and friend.  The hero of the poem is a child born or to be born in 40 B.C., at the time of Pollio's consulate.  A new era was expected, in fulfillment of an older oracle.&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung

Has come and gone, and the majestic roll

Of circling centuries begins anew:

Justice returns, returns old Saturn's reign,

With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.

The iron shall cease, the golden race arise,

Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own

Apollo reigns ...

"For thee, O boy,

First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth

Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray

With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed,

And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves,

Untended, will the she-goats then bring home

Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism}}
In the story of [[Krishna]] the deity is the agent of conception and also the offspring.  Because of his sympathy for the earth, the divine [[Vishnu]] himself descended into the womb of [[Devaki]] and was born as her son, Krishna. The Hindu Vishnu Purana relates: "Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed deity...before the birth of Krishna, no one “could bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light that invested her, and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds disturbed.” This reference to light is reminiscent of the Vedic hymn "To an Unknown God," which refers to a Golden Child.  According to F. M. Müller this term means "the golden germ of child" and is an attempt at naming the sun.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

This is  occasionally brought up as evidence for the hypothesis that "virgin birth" tales are a fairly common phenomenon in non-Christian religions around the world.&lt;ref name="Hitchens, Christopher"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything (Paperback), 2007, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen, Chapman"&gt;Chapman Cohen, Essays in Freethinking, 1927, "Monism and Religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/13726978 |title=Private Video on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing in Hindu scriptures to suggest that it was a "virgin" birth. By the time of conception and birth of Krishna, Devaki was married to [[Vasudeva]] and had already borne seven children.&lt;ref name="Vishnu Puran"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Vishnupurana-English-MnDutt#page/n307/mode/2up/search/devaki |title=VishnuPurana - English - MN Dutt |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Hindus believe that when the emanations of the Supreme Being are [[pratyaksha]], or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an embodiment and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.&lt;ref name="On Egypt and the Nile"&gt;Wilford, On Egypt and the Nile, Asiatic Researches, Vol. III p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Buddha#Conception and birth}}
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Queen Maya Birth.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Māyā]] miraculously giving birth to Siddhārtha. [[Sanskrit]], [[palm-leaf manuscript]]. [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], [[Bihar]], India. [[Pala Empire|Pāla period]]]]

The stories of Buddha’s unusual birth developed through the centuries. Two accounts cited by Boslooper tell of the descent of the future Bodhisattva from the "Tusita Body" into the mother’s womb, the appearance of the [[Buddha]] in the mother as a shining gem, and the accompanying wonders in the natural world.  These are the Majjhima-Nikāya, 123 Acchariyabbhutadhammasuta III. 119-124; (I. B. Horner, 1959, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–169); and Māhapadānasutta, Dīgha ii. 12.&lt;ref name="Davids, T. W. rhys"&gt;Davids, T. W. Rhys, Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, Vol. III (1910), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the [[Vipassī Buddha]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother’s womb mindful and self-possessed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this text, the [[Vipassī Buddha]] was the first of six incarnations to precede [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]]. The others listed are [[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhī]], [[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhū]], [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], [[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Koṇāgamana]], and [[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]]. The most popular legendary account of the birth of Buddha is in the Nidanakatha Jataka (see, [[Jataka tales]]) which accounted for the lives of Buddha in previous incarnations.  In this account, the “Great Being” chose the time and place of his birth, the tribe into which he would be born, and who his mother would be.  In the time chosen by him, Maya, his mother, fell asleep and dreamed that four archangels carried her to the [[Himalayan Mountains]] where their queens bathed and dressed her.  In her dream the Great Being soon entered her womb from her side, in the form of a white elephant. When she woke, she told her dream to the Raja, who summoned sixty-four eminent [[Brahman]]s to interpret it.

"Then is described how at his birth he took seven great steps and at the seventh he shouted, 'I am the chief of the world,' how he at birth held in his hand some medicine that became for him the drug by which he later healed the sick and blind and deaf, how at birth he wished to give a gift but was presented one himself by his mother, and how lastly he sang the song of victory.'

===Yellow Emperor===
The [[Yellow Emperor]] is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the [[Big Dipper]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, ''Asian Mythologies''. University of Chicago Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0226064565}}. p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Abandoned One===
Qi, the Abandoned One, who later became known as [[Houji]] {{ndash}} a [[culture hero]] or [[god of agriculture]] {{ndash}} was held in some accounts to have been miraculously conceived when his mother, the consort [[Jiang Yuan]], stepped into a footprint left by the supreme god [[Shangdi]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. "Hou Ji".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laozi===
Some [[Taoism|Taoist]] schools held that [[Laozi]] was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He was born while his mother was leaning against a [[plum tree]]. Laozi was said to have emerged as an old man with a full grey beard. This may be because his name {{ndash}} "Old Master" ({{lang|zh|老子}}) {{ndash}} can also be read as "Old Child".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Diane, ''The Best Guide to Eastern Philosophy and Religion'', New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abaoji===
There are some legends about the birth of [[Abaoji]] (also known as Yi), the Emperor Taizu of Liao. According to the legends, his mother dreamed that the sun fell from the sky and into her bosom, from which pregnancy followed.  When she gave birth, the room is said to have become filled with a mysterious light and extraordinary fragrance.  As a newborn, his body was that of a three-year-old, and the legends go on to say that he was walking at the age of three months.&lt;ref&gt;Mote, F.W. (2003), ''Imperial China:900-1800'', Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
Mainstream scholars agree that the [[nativity of Jesus]], if not taken as [[Historical Jesus|historically accurate]], should be interpreted within the context of first-century Judaism, not in the context of foreign mythologies, which contain only remote similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D.G. Dunn]], "Myth" in ''Dictionary of Jesus and Gospels'' ed. Joel B. Green, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Aus, Matthew 1-2 and the Virginal Conception in Light of Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaic Traditions on the Birth of Israel's First Redeemer Moses (Studies in Judaism, Landham: University Press of America, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mary===
{{Main|Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|Immaculate Conception|Nativity of Mary|Nativity of the Theotokos}}
According to tradition of the Catholic church, the Virgin Mary's parents, [[St. Anne]] and [[St. Joachim]], were childless, when an angel came to them and [[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|told them]] they would give birth to a daughter. During the [[Immaculate Conception|conception of Mary]], she was preserved from the stain of [[original sin]].

===Jesus===
{{Main|Nativity of Jesus|Virgin birth of Jesus}}
[[File:Iconnativity.jpg|thumb|right|[[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]] [[icon]] of the Nativity.]]
The [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] describe the nativity of [[Jesus]]. In the account in the Gospel of Luke, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] learns from the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] that she will conceive and bear a child. When she asks how this can be, since she is a virgin, he tells her that the [[Holy Spirit]] would "come upon her" and that "nothing will be impossible with God". She responds: "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:31-38|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that Mary is due to give birth, she and her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] travel from their home in [[Nazareth]] to Joseph's ancestral home in [[Bethlehem]] to register in the [[Census of Quirinius]]. Finding no place for themselves in the inn, Mary gives birth to Jesus and she places him in a [[manger]] (feeding trough).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:1-7|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Annunciation to the shepherds|angel of the Lord visits the shepherds]] guarding their flocks in nearby fields and brings them "good news of great joy": "to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord." The angel tells them they will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.

In the Gospel of Matthew, the impending birth is announced to Joseph in a dream, in which he is instructed to name the child Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:21|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Star of Bethlehem|star]] reveals the birth of Jesus to a number (traditionally three) of [[Biblical Magi|''magi'']], Greek ''μάγος'', commonly translated as "wise man" but in this context probably meaning "astronomer" or "astrologer",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

After the 1st century, traditions flourished that represented the thinking of that time, and also preserved source material for many of the ideas in the "theological writings of the church fathers." In their present form the [[pseudepigrapha]]l writings contained in the [[Sibylline Oracles]] include literature written from the 2nd century BC through the 6th century of the Christian era. They contain some material relevant to the birth and infancy of Jesus. But this passage in the Oracles, Book III, probably represents the hopes of pre-Christian Alexandrian Jews.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Be of good cheer, O maiden, and exult; for the Eternal, who made heaven and earth, has given thee joy, and he will dwell in thee, and for thee shall be an immortal light.
And wolves and lambs promiscuously shall eat grass in the mountains, and among the kids shall leopards graze,
And wandering bears shall lodge among the calves, and the carnivorous lion
shall eat straw in the manger like the ox,
and little children lead them with a band. For tame will be on earth the beasts he made,
And with young babes will dragons fall asleep, and no harm, for God’s hand will be on them."&lt;ref name="Terry, Milton Spenser"&gt;Terry, Milton Spenser, Aloisius Rzach, The Sibylline Oracles, Eaton &amp; Mains, Cincinnati:: Curtis &amp; Jennings, 1899 (page 93, lines 975-984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, the church fathers refer to subsequent books in the Oracles that are clear allusions to Christ, and probably dated from the close of the second or beginning of the 3rd century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The first Christian theologians demonstrated in their writings their knowledge of such non-canonical sources.

The [[New Testament apocrypha#Non-canonical gospels|non-canonical gospels]] contain much that is pertinent. The apocryphal literature departs from the Christian canon and its legends have many elements similar to [[pagan]] stories representing popular beliefs of the church from the second Christian century on through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|left|Mary and Jesus in old [[Persian miniature|Persian Shi'a miniature]].]]

===Jesus in Islam===
The [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic literature contain reports of a number of miraculous births of biblical characters. The [[Qur'an]] describes [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of Jesus by Mary (Arabic: ''Maryam''), which is recounted throughout several passages in the Qur'an. The narrative goes that Mary was visited by the angel Gabriel that she will give birth to a holy son, named Isa' (Jesus), the Messiah and that he will be a great prophet, to whom God will give the Injil (Gospel) and he will speak in infancy and maturity and will be a companion to the most righteous. When this news was given to Mary, she asked the angel how she can have a baby as she was a [[virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, Verse 43&lt;/ref&gt; To this, the angel replied "Even though when God wants to create a matter, he merely wills (Kun-fa-yakun) it and the things come into being".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, verse 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, while resting near the trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live and likewise to cherish my mother" in order to dispel rumours of conception.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"&gt;"Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc-range|19|30|e=31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'' and ''[[Arabic Infancy Gospel]]''.

===Muhammad===
After the death of the [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]] his wife [[Aminah]] had a vision where angels visited her and informed that soon she will give birth to a boy and told her to name him [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://seekerofthesacredknowledge.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/miracles-that-took-place-at-the-time-of-beloved-prophets-blessed-birth%E2%80%8F/&lt;/ref&gt; When Prophet Muhammad was about to be born, Aminah was visited by [[Eve|Hawa]], [[Asiya, wife of the Pharaoh|Asiya]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] with angels to help her.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.islam-today.ru/society/aminah-the-mother-of-muhammad-peace-be-upon-him/&lt;/ref&gt; All the pagan idols of [[Kaaba]] fall down and bright light appeared.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamicmisconceptions.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miracles-on-birth-of-prophet-mohammed-s-a-w/&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Karna]], Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/kabir/ |title=Kabir presented in Philosophy section |publisher=Newsfinder.org |date=2003-05-24 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8319260/Images-of-Kabir |title=Images of Kabir |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as secretly descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority in the eyes of the Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.

===Aztec mythology===

====Huitzilopochtli====
The myth of [[Huitzilopochtli]] is uniquely [[Aztec]]. Huitzilopochtli is therefore considered to be the cult god or the patron god of the [[Aztec]]. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with [[Tonatiuh]]. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was [[Coatlicue]], or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground. She decided to save them and placed them in her bosom.

There are several stories about the birth of [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In the first story, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named [[Chimalman]], to whom the god [[Ometeotl]] appeared in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Bierlein, ''Living Myths.

F. Bierlein, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016|talk=Bierlein_cite_about_Quetzalcoatl}} A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from [[Coatlicue]], who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Mongolian mythology===
According to a legend narrated by ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', a Mongol woman named [[Alan Gua]] had a son, named [[Bodonchar Munkhag|Bodonchar]], some years after her husband has died. She claimed a radiant yellow person visited her at night and impregnated her. She believed the visitor was the god [[Tengri]]. Bodonchar became the founder of the [[Borjigin]] tribe and a direct ancestor of [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lococo Paul, ''Genghis Khan: History's Greatest Empire Builder'', Potomac Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese mythology===
Miraculous births are common in Japanese folklore, and include [[Momotarō]] the Peach Boy (who was found inside a giant peach floating on a river), [[Kintarō]] (about whom several origin myths are told), and [[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Kaguya-hime]] (who was born inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant).

===Native American mythology===
The [[Great Peacemaker]], sometimes referred to as Deganawida or Dekanawida ([[Iroquois]]) was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, so the birth was miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Discovery TV |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFIgq8D3oRk|location= Location 14:00min |title=War of the American Indians : Documentary on the History of the Iroquois |date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zalta|Zalta, Edward N.]] |title=Emotions in the Christian Tradition |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion-Christian-tradition/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |volume=Winter 2016 |date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Ontology of Religiosity: The Oceanic Feeling and the Value of the Lived Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Freud discusses the feeling in his ''[[The Future of an Illusion|Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FreudS-CIVILIZATION-AND-ITS-DISCONTENTS-text-final.pdf pp. 11–13].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a [[Romain Rolland#Correspondence with Freud|letter to Freud]]:

{{quote|''Mais j'aurais aimé à vous voir faire l'analyse du sentiment religieux spontané ou, plus exactement, de la ''sensation'' religieuse qui est...le fait simple et direct de ''la sensation de l'Eternel'' (qui peut très bien n'être pas éternel, mais simplement sans bornes perceptibles, et comme océanique).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |last=Masson |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Oceanic Feeling.

In strict translation:

{{quote|But I would have liked to see you doing an analysis of ''spontaneous religious sentiment'' or, more exactly, of religious ''feeling'', which is...the simple and direct fact ''of the feeling of the ‘eternal’'' (which can very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and like oceanic, as it were).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William B. |last=Parsons |title=The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling.

Freud ends ''The Future of an Illusion'' with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of ''Civilization and Its Discontents'', answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.

== Freud's explanation ==
Freud argues that the "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the preserved "primitive ego-feeling" from infancy.  The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it.  Therefore, the infant has no concept of a "self" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist.  Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the "oceanic feeling" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.

== Neuroscientific explanation ==
{{Main article|Neuroscience of religion}}

"Neurotheology" is a [[neologism]] that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Burton |authorlink=Robert A.

What [[Andrew B. Newberg]] and others "discovered is that intensely focused [[meditation|spiritual contemplation]] triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] call ''oneness with the universe''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Newberg, Andrew B. |authorlink=Andrew B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">The '''Orebites''' ({{lang-cz|Orebité}}) were followers of the [[Hussites]] in Eastern Bohemia.  The founders took part in the procession on Mount [[Oreb (hill)|Oreb]] near  [[Třebechovice pod Orebem]].  Later most of the noble supporters belonged to the East Bohemian church known as the ''[[Bohemian Brethren]]''.  The ideological founder of the Orebites was a priest named [[Ambrož Hradecký]].  Leaders included [[Hynek Krušina of Lichtenburg]] and [[Diviš Bořek of Miletínek]], captain of the Hussites in Eastern and Central Bohemia.  The Orebites were instrumental in the burning of the Benedictine monastery in [[Mnichovo Hradiště]] in the early summer of 1420, and in the autumn of that year they supported the rest of the Hussites at the [[Battle of Vyšehrad]].  In 1423 they merged with the ''[[Sirotci]]'' of [[Jan Žižka]].

In [[religion]] and [[esotericism]], the term "'''physical universe'''" or "'''material universe'''" is used to distinguish the [[nature|physical]] [[matter]] of the [[universe]] from a proposed [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence. 

In the [[Book of Veles]], and perhaps in traditional [[Slavic mythology]], the physical universe is referred to as [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Yav]]. [[Gnosticism]] holds that the physical universe was created by a [[Demiurge]]. In [[Dharmic religion]]s [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is believed to be the illusion of a physical universe.

[[Physicalism]], a type of [[monism]], holds that only physical things exist. This is also known as [[metaphysical naturalism]].

'''Pralaya''' ([[Sanskrit]]), in [[Hindu cosmology]], is an aeonic{{what|date=November 2018}} term for ''dissolution'', which specifies different periods of time during which a non-activity situation persists, as per different formats or contexts. The word Mahapralaya stands for ''Great Dissolution''. During each pralaya, the lower ten realms ([[loka]]) are destroyed,&lt;ref name=shivp&gt;{{cite book |title=Shiv Purana|author=B. K. Chaturvedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|year=2004|isbn=8171827217 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bchgql0em9YC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Swargaloka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LuXJT7TDN4OyrAeBoajSDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Swargaloka&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the higher four realms, including [[Satya-loka]], Tapa-loka, Jana-loka, and Mahar-loka are preserved.  During each Mahapralaya, all 14 realms are destroyed.

In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, one of the six schools of classical [[Indian philosophy]], Pralaya means "non-existence", a state of matter achieved when the three gunas (principles of matter) are in perfect balance. The word pra-laya comes from Sanskrit meaning 'dissolution' or by extension 'reabsorption, destruction, annihilation or death'.

==Pralaya in popular culture==
The word pralaya appears in the Cyclops chapter of [[James Joyce]]'s epic novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

"Pralaya" appears in the [[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona|Persona]] series of games (specifically ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]'') as an attack. While it can be inherited to other Personae, its original user is "Shiva", a Persona based on the [[Shiva|Hindu deity of the same name]].

Pralaya is also the name of an antagonist in the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' who appears in the series' final arc, threatening to destroy the fictional multiverse.

Pralaya is an otter-like alien wizard who is sometimes [[Demonic_possession|overshadowed]] by the [[Young_Wizards#The_Lone_Power|Lone Power]] in Diane Duane's [[Young Wizards]] novel, ''[[The Wizard's Dilemma]]''.

The Swedish metal band, [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], references "Mahapralaya" in their song, "Maha Kali".

The '''Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding''' ('''ACMCU''') is an interfaith institution based at the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Overview==
The institution was founded at [[Georgetown University]] in 1993 as the '''Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding'''. It is housed within the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Caryle Murphy, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121200591.html Saudi Gives $20 Million to Georgetown], ''Washington Post'' (December 13, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a wealthy Saudi [[House of Saud|Saudi prince]] and businessman, [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] in 2005, gave $20 million to the Center to promote interfaith understanding and the study of Islam and the [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; The center was renamed in his honor.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafferty"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/saudi-prince-gives-gu-20m/ |title= Saudi Prince Gives GU $20M |first= Steve |last= Rafferty |date= January 12, 2006|work= [[The Hoya]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $20 million gift was the second-largest ever given to the Georgetown at that point.&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; Bin Talal simultaneously gave $20 million to [[Harvard University]]'s interdisciplinary Islamic studies program and $15 million to establish [[American studies]] programs at the [[American University in Beirut]] and [[American University in Cairo]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt;

The founding director of the center was [[John Esposito]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=3762 Press Release: Georgetown University Receives $20 Million Gift From Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal To Expand Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904131933/http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=3762 |date=2006-09-04 }}, December 12, 2005.  Accessed 24 November, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito was succeeded by John O. Voll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pluralism.org/profiles/view/74161 Center Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (2005)], Pluralism Project at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001, is a statute passed by the Victorian Parliament during the Premiership of [[Steve Bracks]]. The Act makes behavior that incites or encourages hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group of people because of their race and/or religion unlawful in Victoria

The Act criminalises racist graffiti, racist posters, racist stickers, racist comments made in a publication, including the Internet and email, statements at a meeting or at a public rally. The Act explicitly criminalises public behavior – not personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001 |title=The Racial and Religious Tolerance Act  |url=https://www.humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/home/the-law/racial-and-religious-tolerance-act |website=Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission |location=Melbourne |access-date=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catch the Fire Ministries - Vilification of Muslims lawsuit==

In a landmark ruling on 17 December 2004, a VCAT tribunal ruled that [[Danny Nalliah]], [[Daniel Scot]] and Catch the Fire Ministries had breached the law. The pair stood accused of making fun of Muslim beliefs and conduct that was "hostile, demeaning and derogatory of all Muslim people, their god, Allah, the prophet Muhammad and in general Muslim religious beliefs and practices". Nalliah publicly condemned the verdict and declared his intention to continue fighting the case, potentially as far as the [[High Court of Australia]]. ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper quoted him as stating, "We may have lost the battle, but the war is not over.

The matter was eventually resolved without a VCAT hearing after mediation between the two parties. On 22 June 2007 VCAT published a statement agreed to by both parties which affirmed everyone's rights to "robustly debate religion including the right to criticise the religious belief of another, in a free, open and democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hosen |first1=Nadirsyah |last2=Mohr |first2=Richard |date=2011 |title=Law and religion in public life: The contemporary debate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |title=Church and Islamic council bury hatchet |last=Turnbull |first=Jeff |date=25 June 2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625063604/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21963547-1702,00.html |archivedate=25 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Patriots Front - Inciting Serious Contempt of Muslims==
In September 2017 three prominent members of the far-right [[United Patriots Front]]; Blair Cottrell, Neil Erikson and Chris Shortis, were charged with serious religious vilification, among other offenses. In September that same year they were convicted for inciting serious contempt of Muslims, each were fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-05/three-men-found-guilty-of-inciting-serious-contempt-for-muslims/8874804|title=Far-right nationalists found guilty of inciting serious contempt for Muslims|date=2017-09-05|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Former state shadow [[Attorney general]] [[Andrew McIntosh (Australian politician)|Andrew McIntosh]] announced prior to the 2006 election that the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] would repeal the religious section of the "fundamentally flawed" Act.&lt;ref name="The Age2"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/libs-coy-over-hatred-laws/2006/08/09/1154802962877.html "libs coy over hatred laws"] 9 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2006, nineteen Christian leaders from Melbourne's largest churches wrote to the Premier requesting the removal of the civil provisions in the act, claiming that aspects of the religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/religious-vilification-law-undermines-multiculturalism/2006/04/30/1146335604488.html "religious vilification law undermines multiculturalism"] [[The Age]] 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent MP [[Russell Savage]], whose support helped Bracks form Government in 1999, described the act as "the worst legislation he had ever seen passed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/speaking-freely-is-risky-business-rally-told/2006/08/08/1154802889839.html "speaking freely is risky business"] [[The Age]] 8 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rationes seminales''''' ([[Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λόγοι σπερματικοὶ'' or ''logoi spermatikoi''), translated variously as germinal or causal principles, primordial reasons, original factors, seminal reasons or virtues, or seedlike principles, is a [[theological]] theory on the origin of species. It is the doctrine that [[God]] created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted ''rationes seminales'', from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.

The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Neoplatonism]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Helmig,''Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition'', Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea was incorporated into [[Christian]] thought through the writings of authors such as  [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Roger Bacon]], until mostly rejected in the modern period. [[Evolution]], though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories (cf "Man incarnate spirit" by Ramon Lucas Lucas). &lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, ''Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought'',  SUNY Press, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''rationes seminales'' was also used as an explanation for [[spontaneous generation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">A '''religious reform''' (from Latin ''re'': back, again, and ''formare'': to form; i.e. put together: ''to restore, reconstruct, or rebuild'') aims at the reform of religious teachings. It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.

== Definition ==

Religious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Johnstone: [https://books.google.de/books/about/Religion_in_Society.html?id=11LuAAAAMAAJ Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion], Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2006. pp. 134 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: ''re-formare'', reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for [[ethics|ethical]] prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Hassan Butt: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/comment.religion1 My plea to fellow Muslims: you must renounce terror], in: The Guardian 01 July 2007; citation: "If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists, Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I'd like to term the Land of Co-existence. And when this new theological territory is opened up, Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world, rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a "final" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by [[Karl Barth]] in 1947: ''[[Ecclesia semper reformanda est]]'', i.e. ''The church is always to be reformed.''&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mahlmann: ''Ecclesia semper reformanda''. Eine historische Aufarbeitung. Neue Bearbeitung, in: Torbjörn Johansson, Robert Kolb, Johann Anselm Steiger (Hrsg.): Hermeneutica Sacra. Studien zur Auslegung der Heiligen Schrift im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert, Berlin - New York 2010, pp. 382-441, here pp. 384-388&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|restore paganism as state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. the struggle for the meaning of ''[[Aggiornamento]]'' in the Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]]. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. title of: J. Schacht: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282132 Modernism and Traditionalism in a History of Islamic Law], in:  Middle Eastern Studies Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul., 1965), pp. 388-400&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[First Council of Nicaea]] for the clarification of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], 325 AD.

'''Albert Einstein's religious views''' have been widely studied and often misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;Stachel, John (2001). ''Einstein from ‘B’ to ‘Z’''. New York: Springer Science, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Einstein]] stated that he believed in the [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] God of [[Spinozism|Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Calaprice325"&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2010). ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&amp;pg=PA325 p. 325.]&lt;/ref&gt; He did not believe in a [[personal God]] who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.&lt;ref name="Calaprice213"&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2000). ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified however that, "I am not an atheist",&lt;ref name="Isaacson390"&gt;Isaacson, Walter (2008). ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''. New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;pg=PT390 p. 390.]&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to call himself an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;ref name="Calaprice340"&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2010). ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein''. Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&amp;pg=PA340 p. 340.] [http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2687/4496554935_0b573db853_o.jpg Letter to M. Berkowitz, 25 October 1950.] Einstein Archive 59-215.&lt;/ref&gt; or a "religious nonbeliever."&lt;ref name="Calaprice213"/&gt; Einstein also stated he did not believe in [[afterlife|life after death]], adding "one life is enough for me."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Walter (2008). ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''. New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OzSJgdwk5esC&amp;pg=PT461 p. 461.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was closely involved in his lifetime with several [[secular humanist|humanist]] groups.&lt;ref name="MercifulEnd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IdeasOpinions"/&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
Einstein used many labels to describe his religious views, including "[[Agnosticism|agnostic]]",&lt;ref name="Calaprice340"/&gt; "[[Secular spirituality|religious nonbeliever]]"&lt;ref name="Calaprice213"/&gt; and a "pantheistic"&lt;ref name="Jammer75"&gt;Jammer, Max (2011). [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s6681.pdf ''Einstein and Religion: Physics and Theology''.] Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=58HQXMp1ESwC&amp;pg=PA75 p. 75.]; Originally published in Albert Einstein (1929). ''Gelegentliches''. ["A Miscellany"] Berlin: Soncino Gesellschaft, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; believer in "[[Spinozism|Spinoza's God]]".&lt;ref name="Calaprice325"/&gt; Einstein believed the problem of God was the "most difficult in the world"—a question that could not be answered "simply with yes or no." He conceded that, "the problem involved is too vast for our limited minds."&lt;ref name="Viereck"&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (1930). ''Glimpses of the Great''. New York: The Macaulay Company, pp. 372-373.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early childhood===
Einstein was raised by [[secular Jew]]ish parents, and attended a local [[Catholicism|Catholic]] public elementary school in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;Baierlein, Ralph (1992). ''Newton to Einstein''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sAr-q1skCQC&amp;pg=PA201 pp. 201-202.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Autobiographical Notes'', Einstein wrote that he had gradually lost his faith early in childhood:

&lt;cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . I came—though the child of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents—to a deep religiousness, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of twelve. Through the reading of popular scientific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the [[Bible]] could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of [[Freethought|freethinking]] coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression. Mistrust of every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude toward the convictions that were alive in any specific social environment—an attitude that has never again left me, even though, later on, it has been tempered by a better insight into the causal connections.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite clear to me that the religious paradise of youth, which was thus lost, was a first attempt to free myself from the chains of the 'merely personal,' from an existence dominated by wishes, hopes, and primitive feelings. Out yonder there was this huge world, which exists independently of us human beings and which stands before us like a great, eternal riddle, at least partially accessible to our inspection and thinking. The contemplation of this world beckoned as a liberation, and I soon noticed that many a man whom I had learned to esteem and to admire had found inner freedom and security in its pursuit. The mental grasp of this extra-personal world within the frame of our capabilities presented itself to my mind, half consciously, half unconsciously, as a supreme goal. Similarly motivated men of the present and of the past, as well as the insights they had achieved, were the friends who could not be lost. The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise; but it has shown itself reliable, and I have never regretted having chosen it.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1949). [https://archive.org/details/EinsteinAutobiography "Notes for an Autobiography."] [[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|''Saturday Review of Literature'']] (Nov. 26): 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

===Personal God===

On 22 March 1954 Einstein received a letter from Joseph Dispentiere, an Italian immigrant who had worked as an [[Machinist|experimental machinist]] in [[New Jersey]]. Dispentiere had declared himself an atheist and was disappointed by a news report which had cast Einstein as conventionally religious. Einstein replied on 24 March 1954:

{{Quote|It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Helen (1981). ''Albert Einstein the Human Side''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5R7JsRRtoIC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43.] Einstein Archives [http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000030228 59-454] and [http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000030229 59-495]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book ''Ideas and Opinions'' Einstein stated, "In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests."&lt;ref name="Calaprice213"/&gt; In December 1922 Einstein said the following on the idea of a saviour, "Denominational traditions I can only consider historically and psychologically; they have no other significance for me.&lt;ref name="Jammer75"/&gt;

===Pantheism and Spinoza's God===
Einstein had explored the idea that humans could not understand the nature of God. In an interview published in [[George Sylvester Viereck]]'s book ''Glimpses of the Great'' (1930), Einstein responded to a question about whether or not he defined himself as a [[pantheism|pantheist]]. He explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Your question is the most difficult in the world. It is not a question I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things.&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Viereck, Glimpses of the Great (Macauley, New York, 1930) p. 372-373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Einstein stated, "My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problem—the most important of all human problems."&lt;ref&gt;Holton, G. J. and Yehuda Elkana (1997). ''Albert Einstein: Historical and Cultural Perspectives''. New York: Dover Publications, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HLYgJYqGjhgC&amp;pg=PA309 p. 309.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 1929, Einstein [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|cabled]] Rabbi [[Herbert S. Goldstein]] in German: "I believe in [[Baruch Spinoza#Philosophy|Spinoza's God]], who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Walter (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;dq Einstein: His Life and Universe.]'' New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;pg=PT389 pp. 388-389.] Reported by the ''New York Times'' 25 April 1929 under the headline [https://www.nytimes.com/1929/04/25/archives/einstein-believes-in-spinozas-god-scientist-defines-his-faith-in.html "Einstein believes in 'Spinoza's God'"]&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded on this in answers he gave to the Japanese magazine ''[[Kaizō]]'' in 1923:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientific research can reduce superstition by encouraging people to think and view things in terms of cause and effect. Certain it is that a conviction, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality and intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order. [...] This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God. In common parlance this may be described as "pantheistic" (Spinoza).&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (2010). ''Ideas And Opinions''. New York: Three Rivers Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vLm4oojTPnkC&amp;pg=PA262 p. 262.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Agnosticism, atheism, and deism===
Einstein called himself an agnostic rather than an atheist, stating: "I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a [[personal god]] is a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being."&lt;ref name="Gilmore"/&gt; In an interview published by the German poet [[George Sylvester Viereck]], Einstein stated, "I am not an Atheist."&lt;ref name="Viereck"/&gt; According to [[Hubertus, Prince of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg|Prince Hubertus]], Einstein said, "In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ronald W. (1971). ''Einstein: The Life and Times''. New York: World Publishing Company, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 Guy Raner, Jr. wrote a letter to Einstein, asking him if it was true that a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest had caused Einstein to convert from atheism. Einstein replied, "I have never talked to a Jesuit priest in my life and I am astonished by the audacity to tell such lies about me. From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist. ... It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the human sphere—childish analogies. We have to admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of this world—as far as we can grasp it, and that is all."&lt;ref&gt;Brian, Denis (1996). ''Einstein: A Life''.  New York: J. Wiley, p. 344. [http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170863 Einstein's Letter of 2 July 1945]; cf. [http://www.bigquestionsonline.com/columns/michael-shermer/einstein%E2%80%99s-god Michael Shermer 13 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1950 letter to M. Berkowitz, Einstein stated that "My position concerning God is that of an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. I am convinced that a vivid consciousness of the primary importance of moral principles for the betterment and ennoblement of life does not need the idea of a law-giver, especially a law-giver who works on the basis of reward and punishment."&lt;ref name="Calaprice340"/&gt;

According to biographer [[Walter Isaacson]], Einstein was more inclined to denigrate atheists than religious people.&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"&gt;Isaacson, Walter (2007). [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607298,00.html "Einstein and Faith"] ''Time'' 169 (April 5): 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein said in correspondence, "[T]he fanatical atheists...are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who—in their grudge against the traditional '[[Opium of the masses|opium of the people]]'—cannot hear the [[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]."&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jammer, Max (2002).

===Belief in an afterlife===
On 17 July 1953 a woman who was a licensed [[Baptist]] pastor sent Einstein a letter asking if he had felt assured about attaining everlasting life with the Creator. Einstein replied, "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it."&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Helen (1981). ''Albert Einstein the Human Side''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2fswAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was also expressed in Einstein's book ''[[The World as I See It (book)|The World as I See It]]'', "I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves. An individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my comprehension, nor do I wish it otherwise; such notions are for the fears or absurd egoism of feeble souls. Enough for me the mystery of the eternity of life, and the inkling of the marvellous structure of reality, together with the single-hearted endeavour to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the reason that manifests itself in nature."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1999). ''The World as I See It''. Secaucus, NJ: Citadel Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aNKOo94tO6cC&amp;pg=PA5 p. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was averse to the [[Afterlife#Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] conception of [[Heaven]] and [[Christian views on hell|Hell]], particularly as it pertained to a system of everlasting reward and punishment. In a 1915 letter to the Swiss physicist Edgar Meyer Einstein wrote, "I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities, for which only He Himself can be held responsible; in my opinion, only His nonexistence could excuse Him."&lt;ref&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2000). ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own —- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms."&lt;ref name="Rowe229"&gt;Rowe, David and Robert Schulmann (2007). ''Einstein on Politics: His Private Thoughts and Public Stands on Nationalism''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AIHgK-p6mhgC&amp;pg=PA229 pp. 229-230.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of Einstein's tension with the Abrahamic afterlife was his belief in [[determinism]] and his rejection of [[free will]]. Einstein stated, "The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events —- that is, if he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it goes through."&lt;ref name="NYTimes1930"&gt;Einstein, Albert (1930). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/einstein_religion.html "Religion and Science,"] ''New York Times Magazine'' (Nov. 9): [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJY5GycDoUUC&amp;pg=PA29 3-4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic spirituality===
In 1930 Einstein published a widely discussed essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' about his beliefs.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1930"/&gt; With the title "Religion and Science," Einstein distinguished three human impulses which develop [[religious belief]]: fear, social or moral concerns, and a cosmic religious feeling. A primitive understanding of [[causality]] causes fear, and the fearful invent supernatural beings analogous to themselves. The desire for love and support create a social and moral need for a supreme being; both these styles have an [[anthropomorphic]] concept of God. The third style, which Einstein deemed most mature, originates in a deep sense of awe and mystery. He said, the individual feels "the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves in nature ... and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole." Einstein saw science as an antagonist of the first two styles of religious belief, but as a partner in the third.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1930"/&gt;  He maintained, "even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other" there are "strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies" as aspirations for truth derive from the religious sphere. He continued:

&lt;cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value. It seems to me that what is important is the force of this superpersonal content ... regardless of whether any attempt is made to unite this content with a Divine Being, for otherwise it would not be possible to count [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as religious personalities. Accordingly a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance of those super-personal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation ... In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be...&lt;ref name="NYTimes1930"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

An understanding of causality was fundamental to Einstein's ethical beliefs. In Einstein's view, "the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science," for religion can always take refuge in areas that science can not yet explain. It was Einstein's belief that in the "struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope" and cultivate the "Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself."&lt;ref name="NYTimes1930"/&gt;

Catholic Cardinal [[William Henry O'Connell]] spoke about Einstein's perceived lack of belief, "The outcome of this doubt and befogged speculation about [[Spacetime|time and space]] is a cloak beneath which hides the ghastly apparition of atheism."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Walter (2007). ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''. New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;pg=PA388 p. 388.]&lt;/ref&gt; A Bronx Rabbi criticized both the Cardinal and Einstein for opining on matters outside their expertise: "Einstein would have done better had he not proclaimed his nonbelief in a God who is concerned with fates and actions of individuals. Both have handed down dicta outside their jurisdiction."&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Walter (2007). ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''. New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&amp;pg=PA389 p. 389.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic priest and broadcaster [[Fulton Sheen]]—whose intellect Einstein admired, even calling him "one of the most intelligent people in today's world"&lt;ref&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2000). [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html ''The New Quotable Einstein'']. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;—described Einstein's ''New York Times Magazine'' article "the sheerest kind of stupidity and nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, David and Robert Schulmann (2007). ''Einstein on Politics''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AIHgK-p6mhgC&amp;pg=PA235 p. 235.] {{ISBN|0-691-12094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1934 book ''[[The World as I See It (book)|The World as I See It]]'', Einstein expanded on his religiosity, "A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in their most elementary forms — it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (2006). ''The World As I See It''. New York: Citadel Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJY5GycDoUUC&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Einstein received a letter from a young girl in the sixth grade. She had asked him, with the encouragement of her teacher, if scientists [[prayer|pray]]. Einstein replied in the most elementary way he could:
{{Quote|Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the actions of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a supernatural being. However, it must be admitted that our actual knowledge of these laws is only imperfect and fragmentary, so that, actually, the belief in the existence of basic all-embracing laws in nature also rests on a sort of faith. All the same this faith has been largely justified so far by the success of scientific research. But, on the other hand, everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive.”&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (2013) ''Albert Einstein, The Human Side''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2fswAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 pp. 32-33.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Einstein characterized himself as "devoutly religious" in the following sense, "The most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mystical. It is the power of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead. To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms—this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong to the rank of devoutly religious men."&lt;ref name="Rowe229"/&gt;

In December 1952, he commented on what inspires his religiosity, "My feeling is religious insofar as I am imbued with the insufficiency of the human mind to understand more deeply the harmony of the universe which we try to formulate as 'laws of nature.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Einstein for the 21st Century: His Legacy in Science, Art, and Modern Culture |edition=illustrated |first1=Peter |last1=Galison |first2=Gerald James |last2=Holton |first3=Silvan S. |last3=Schweber |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13520-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKbb0Zyp_7gC&amp;pg=PA37 37] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKbb0Zyp_7gC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Maurice Solovine]] Einstein spoke about his reasons for using the word "religious" to describe his spiritual feelings, "I can understand your aversion to the use of the term 'religion' to describe an emotional and psychological attitude which shows itself most clearly in Spinoza. (But) I have not found a better expression than 'religious' for the trust in the rational nature of reality that is, at least to a certain extent, accessible to human reason."&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Maurice, Alan Mackay, James Woudhuysen, eds.

Einstein frequently referred to his belief system as "cosmic religion" and authored an [[eponym]]ous article on the subject in 1954, which later became his book ''Ideas and Opinions'' in 1955.&lt;ref name="JHU Press, 2005"&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2005). ''The Einstein Almanac''. Baltimore: JHU Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=if2tnCjo8WMC&amp;pg=PA91 p. 91.]&lt;/ref&gt; The belief system recognized a "miraculous order which manifests itself in all of nature as well as in the world of ideas," devoid of a personal God who rewards and punishes individuals based on their behavior. It rejected a conflict between [[Relationship between religion and science|science and religion]], and held that cosmic religion was necessary for science.&lt;ref name="JHU Press, 2005"/&gt; For Einstein, "science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1956).

Nonetheless, I would have been in good company."&lt;ref name="WHermanns"/&gt; Einstein devised a theology for the cosmic religion, wherein the rational discovery of the secrets of nature is a religious act.&lt;ref name="donhoward"&gt;Don Howard, Lesson no. 22, "Cosmic Religion and Jewish Identity", [http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/albert-einstein-physicist-philosopher-humanitarian.html Albert Einstein: Physicist, Philosopher, Humanitarian] , Course No. 8122, The Teaching Company, LLC, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His religion and his philosophy were integral parts of the same package as his scientific discoveries.&lt;ref name="donhoward"/&gt;

=== Jewish identity ===
In a letter to [[Eric Gutkind]] dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote in German, "For me the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the [[Jews|Jewish people]] to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything '[[Chosen people|chosen]]' about them."&lt;ref name="Frohlichletter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20080517" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC-20121005" /&gt;

In an interview published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine with [[George Sylvester Viereck]], Einstein spoke of his feelings about Christianity.&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"/&gt; Born in Germany, Viereck supported [[Nazism|National Socialism]] but he was not anti-semitic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-shgape&amp;month=0003&amp;week=a&amp;msg=b%2BurRQGOLUJM0%2B/LR3n0tw&amp;user=&amp;pw= American National Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; And like Einstein he was a pacifist.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Maurice, Alan Mackay, James Woudhuysen, eds. (2013). ''Einstein: The First Hundred Years''. New York: Pergamon Press. [https://books.google.com/books?id=n5c4BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 p. 100.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Shingo (2005). [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jul/05/japan.internationaleducationnews "Einstein's pacifist dilemma revealed."] July 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the interview Einstein was informed that Viereck was not Jewish,&lt;ref name="ViereckSEP"&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (1929). [http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf "What Life Means to Einstein,"] ''Saturday Evening Post'' (Oct. 26): 17, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; but stated that Viereck had "the psychic adaptability of the Jew," making it possible for Einstein to talk to him "without barrier."&lt;ref name="ViereckSEP"/&gt; Viereck began by asking Einstein if he considered himself a German or a Jew, to which Einstein responded, "It's possible to be both." Viereck moved along in the interview to ask Einstein if Jews should try to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilate]], to which Einstein replied "We Jews have been too eager to sacrifice our idiosyncrasies in order to conform."&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"/&gt; Einstein was then asked to what extent he was influenced by Christianity. "As a child I received instruction both in the [[Bible]] and in the [[Talmud]]. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of [[Nazarene (title)|the Nazarene]]."&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"/&gt; Einstein was then asked if he accepted the [[Historicity of Jesus|historical existence of Jesus]], to which he replied, "Unquestionably! No one can read the [[Gospel]]s without feeling the actual presence of [[Jesus]]. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life."&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"/&gt;

In a conversation with the Dutch poet [[Willem Frederik Hermans]] Einstein stressed that, "I seriously doubt that Jesus himself said that he was God, for he was too much a Jew to violate that great commandment: [[Shema Yisrael|Hear O Israel, the Eternal is our God and He is one!]]' and [[Monotheism#Judaism|not two or three]]."&lt;ref name="Hermanns62"&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). ''Einstein and the Poet: In Search of the Cosmic Man''. Brookline Village MA: Branden Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62.]&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein lamented, "Sometimes I think it would have been better if Jesus had never lived. No name was so abused for the sake of power!"&lt;ref name="Hermanns62"/&gt; In his 1934 book [[The World as I See It (book)|''The World as I See It'']] he expressed his belief that "if one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1954). ''Ideas and Opinions''. New York: Bonanza Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vLm4oojTPnkC&amp;pg=PA185 pp. 184-185.] Originally from [[The World as I See It (book)|WAISI]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later in a 1943 interview Einstein added, "It is quite possible that we can do greater things than Jesus, for what is written in the Bible about him is poetically embellished."&lt;ref name="Calaprice337"&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2011). ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&amp;pg=PA337 p. 337.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein interpreted the concept of a [[Kingdom of God]] as referring to the best people. "I have always believed that Jesus meant by the Kingdom of God the small group scattered all through time of intellectually and ethically valuable people."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the last year of his life he said "If I were not a Jew I would be a [[Quaker]]."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ronald W. (1995). ''Einstein: The Life and Times''. New York: Random House Value Publishing, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of the Christian churches===
The only Jewish school in [[Munich]] had been closed in 1872 for want of students, and in the absence of an alternative Einstein attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]].&lt;ref&gt;Fölsing, Albrecht (1997). ''Albert Einstein: a biography''. London: Penguin, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; He also received Jewish religious education at home, but he did not see a division between the two faiths, as he perceived the "sameness of all religions".&lt;ref name="Sachs"&gt;Sachs, Andrew and Peter Jones (1930). ''Albert Einstein''. Taylor and Francis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y5YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein was equally impressed by the stories of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Sachs"/&gt; According to biographer [[Walter Isaacson]], Einstein immensely enjoyed the Catholic religion courses which he received at the school.&lt;ref name="Einstein and Faith"/&gt; The teachers at his school were liberal and generally made no distinction between student's religions, although some harbored an innate but mild antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Folsing"&gt;Fölsing, Albrecht (1997). ''Albert Einstein: a biography''. London: Penguin, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein later recalled an incident involving a teacher who particularly liked him, "One day that teacher brought a long nail to the lesson and told the students that with such nails Christ had been nailed to the Cross by the Jews" and that "Among the children at the elementary school anti-Semitism was prevalent...Physical attacks and insults on the way home from school were frequent, but for the most part not too vicious."&lt;ref name="Folsing"/&gt; Einstein noted, "That was at a Catholic school; how much worse the antisemitism must be in other Prussian schools, one can only imagine."&lt;ref name="p. 32"&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). ''Einstein and the Poet. In Search of the Cosmic Man''. Brookline Village MA: Branden Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; He would later in life recall that "The religion of the fathers, as I encountered it in Munich during religious instruction and in the synagogue, repelled rather than attracted me."&lt;ref&gt;Fölsing, Albrecht (1997). ''Albert Einstein: a biography''. London: Penguin, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein met several times and collaborated with the Belgian priest scientist [[Georges Lemaître]], of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]]. Fr Lemaitre is known as the first proponent of the [[big bang theory]] of the origins of the cosmos and pioneer in applying Einstein's theory of general relativity to cosmology. Einstein proposed Lemaitre for the 1934 [[Francqui Prize]], which he received from the Belgian King.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, R.D. and S Mitton (2013). ''Georges Lemaître: Life, Science and Legacy''. New York: Springer Science, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSJEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 p. 10.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted Einstein lauding the [[Catholic Church]] for its role in opposing the [[Nazism|Nazis]]: 
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (1940). [http://www.drjudithreisman.com/archives/2010/11/religion_german.html "Religion: German Martyrs"] ''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601401223,00.html Time]'' 36 (Dec. 23): 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

The quotation has since been repeatedly cited by defenders of [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pope Pius XII]].&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-01-05/ | title = Did Einstein Praise the Church? | date = 2006-01-05 | accessdate = 2010-03-25 | work = eSkeptic | publisher = The Skeptics Society | last = Waterhouse | first = William C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation of the quotation by mathematician [[William C. Waterhouse]] and Barbara Wolff of the [[Einstein Archives]] in [[Jerusalem]] found that the statement was mentioned in an unpublished letter from 1947. In the letter to Count Montgelas, Einstein explained that the original comment was a casual one made to a journalist regarding the support of "a few churchmen" for individual rights and intellectual freedom during the early rule of Hitler and that, according to Einstein, the comment had been drastically exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse"/&gt;

On 11 November 1950 the Rev. Cornelius Greenway of Brooklyn wrote a letter to Einstein which had also quoted his alleged remarks about the Church. Einstein responded, "I am, however, a little embarrassed. The wording of the statement you have quoted is not my own. Shortly after Hitler came to power in Germany I had an oral conversation with a newspaper man about these matters. Since then my remarks have been elaborated and exaggerated nearly beyond recognition. I cannot in good conscience write down the statement you sent me as my own. The matter is all the more embarrassing to me because I, like yourself, I am predominantly critical concerning the activities, and especially the political activities, through history of the official clergy. Thus, my former statement, even if reduced to my actual words (which I do not remember in detail) gives a wrong impression of my general attitude."&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Helen, ed. (1981). ''Albert Einstein, The Human Side''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5R7JsRRtoIC&amp;pg=PA94 p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Antiques Roadshow]] television program aired a manuscript expert, Catherine Williamson, authenticating a 1943 letter from Einstein in which he confirms that he "made a statement which corresponds approximately" to ''Time'' magazine's quotation of him. However, Einstein continued, "I made this statement during the first years of the Nazi regime—much earlier than 1940—and my expressions were a little more moderate."&lt;ref&gt;Antiques Roadshow (2008). [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200706A19.htm "1943 Albert Einstein Letter"] PBS. May 19. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk_-0UiiauU Video]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== William Hermanns conversations ====
Einstein's conversations with William Hermanns were recorded over a 34-year correspondence. In the conversations Einstein makes various statements about the Christian Churches in general and the Catholic Church in particular: "When you learn the history of the Catholic Church, you wouldn't trust the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]]. Hasn't Hitler promised to smash the Bolsheviks in Russia? The Church will bless its Catholic soldiers to march alongside the Nazis" (March 1930).&lt;ref name="p. 32"/&gt; "I predict that the Vatican will support Hitler if he comes to power. The Church since Constantine has always favoured the authoritarian State, as long as the State allows the Church to baptize and instruct the masses" (March 1930).&lt;ref&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA32 pp. 32-33.]&lt;/ref&gt; "So often in history the Jews have been the instigators of justice and reform whether in Spain, Germany or Russia. But no sooner have they done their job than their 'friends', often blessed by the Church, spit in their faces" (August 1943).&lt;ref&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA46 p. 46.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"But what makes me shudder is that the Catholic Church is silent. One doesn't need to be a prophet to say, 'The Catholic Church will pay for this silence...I do not say that the unspeakable crimes of the Church for 2,000 years had always the blessing of the Vatican, but it vaccinated its believers with the idea: We have the true God, and the Jews have crucified Him.' The Church sowed hate instead of love, though the ten commandments state: Thou shalt not kill" (August 1943).&lt;ref&gt;Hermanns, William (1983).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA63 p. 63.]&lt;/ref&gt; "With a few exceptions, the Roman Catholic Church has stressed the value of dogma and ritual, conveying the idea theirs is the only way to reach heaven. I don't need to go to Church to hear if I'm good or bad; my heart tells me this" (August 1943).&lt;ref name="Hermanns65"&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA65 p. 65.]&lt;/ref&gt; "I don't like to implant in youth the Church's doctrine of a personal God, because that Church has behaved so inhumanly in the past 2,000 years... Consider the hate the Church manifested against the Jews and then against the Muslims, the [[Crusades]] with their crimes, the burning stakes of the [[Spanish Inquisition|inquisition]], the tacit consent of Hitler's actions while the Jews and the Poles dug their own graves and were slaughtered. And Hitler is said to have been an altar boy!" (August 1943).&lt;ref name="Hermanns65"/&gt;

"Yes" Einstein replied vehemently, "It is indeed human, as proved by [[Cardinal Pacelli]] (the future [[Pope Pius XII]]), who was behind the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] with Hitler. Since when can one make a pact with Christ and Satan at the same time?" (August 1943).&lt;ref name="Hermanns65"/&gt; "The Church has always sold itself to those in power, and agreed to any bargain in return for immunity." (August 1943)&lt;ref&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66.]&lt;/ref&gt; "If I were allowed to give advice to the Churches," Einstein continued, "I would tell them to begin with a conversion among themselves, and to stop playing power politics. Consider what mass misery they have produced in [[Spain]], [[South America]] and [[Russia]]." (September 1948).&lt;ref name="Hermanns105"&gt;Hermanns, William (1983).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA105 p. 105.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a Catholic convert who asked "Didn't you state that the Church was the only opponent of Communism?" Einstein replied, "I don't have to emphasise that the Church [''sic''] at last became a strong opponent of National Socialism, as well." Einstein's secretary [[Helen Dukas]] added, "Dr. Einstein didn't mean only the Catholic church, but all churches."&lt;ref name="Hermanns199"&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA119 p. 119.]&lt;/ref&gt; When the convert mentioned that family members had been gassed by the Nazis, Einstein replied that "he also felt guilty—adding that the whole Church, beginning with the Vatican, should feel guilt." (September 1948)&lt;ref name="Hermanns199"/&gt;

When asked for more precise responses, Einstein replied: "About God, I cannot accept any concept based on the authority of the Church. [...] As long as I can remember, I have resented mass indoctrination. I do not believe in the fear of life, in the fear of death, in blind faith. I cannot prove to you that there is no personal God, but if I were to speak of him, I would be a liar. I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil. My God created laws that take care of that. His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking but by immutable laws."&lt;ref&gt;Hermanns, William (1983). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXCyjj6T5ZUC&amp;pg=PA132 p. 132.]&lt;/ref&gt; William Miller of ''[[Life Magazine]]'' who was present at this meeting described Einstein as looking like a "living saint" and speaking with "angelic indifference."&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Pat (1955). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dlYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 "Death of a Genius"] ''Life Magazine'' 38 (May 2): 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical beliefs==
Einstein believed that when trying to understand nature one should engage in both philosophical enquiry and enquiry through the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"&gt;Stamp, Philip (2014). [http://pitp.physics.ubc.ca/quant_lect/2014/GR100/Einstein_philosophical%20ideas3.pdf "Einstein: Philosophical Ideas."] Retrieved 14 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a young age he had an interest in philosophy. Einstein said about himself: "As a young man I preferred books whose content concerned a whole world view and, in particular, philosophical ones. Schopenhauer, David Hume, Mach, to some extent Kant, Plato, Aristotle."&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

===Relationship between science and philosophy===
Einstein believed that [[epistemology]] and science "are dependent upon each other. Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is—insofar as it is thinkable at all—primitive and muddled."&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/#ConAlbEinPhiPhy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free will===
Like Spinoza, Einstein was a strict [[determinist]] who believed that human behavior was completely determined by causal laws.  For that reason, he refused the chance aspect of quantum theory, famously telling Niels Bohr: "God does not play dice with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin (1996). ''The Night Is Large: Collected Essays, 1938-1995''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oXEaTdstD7gC&amp;pg=PA430 p. 430.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In letters sent to physicist [[Max Born]], Einstein revealed his devout belief in causal relationships:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You believe in a God who plays dice, and I in complete law and order in a world which objectively exists, and which I in a wildly speculative way, am trying to capture.  I firmly ''believe'', but I hope that someone will discover a more realistic way, or rather a more tangible basis than it has been my lot to find.  Even the great initial success of the quantum theory does not make me believe in the fundamental dice game, although I am well aware that some of our younger colleagues interpret this as a consequence of senility.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, John (1995). ''Risk''. London: University College London Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=swTOWkpOP68C&amp;pg=PA18 p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Einstein's emphasis on 'belief' and how it connected with [[determinism]] was illustrated in a letter of condolence responding to news of the death of [[Michele Besso]], one of his lifelong friends.  Einstein wrote to the family: "Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me.  That signifies nothing.  For us believing physicists the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Donald and Marcia Bartusiak (2006). ''E = Einstein: His Life, His Thought, and His Influence on Our Culture''. New York: Stirling Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGzcV40b3IkC&amp;pg=PA187 p. 187.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein had admitted to a fascination with philosopher Spinoza's deterministic version of pantheism. American philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]], in seeking to distinguish deterministic views with his own belief of free will [[panentheism]], coined the distinct typology "[[Classical pantheism]]" to distinguish the views of those who hold similar positions to Spinoza's deterministic version of pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray, John B. Cobb, Clark H. Pinnock (2000). ''Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue Between Process and Free Will Theists'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 177. ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' Volume 10 refers to this view as an "extreme [[monism]]" where, "God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions."&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also an [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]], in 1932 he said the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not believe in free will. Schopenhauer's words: 'Man can do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wills,' accompany me in all situations throughout my life and reconcile me with the actions of others, even if they are rather painful to me. This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper.&lt;ref&gt;Elkana, Yehuda and Adi Ophir, eds. (1979). ''Einstein 1879-1979: Exhibition''. New York: Jewish National and University Library, [http://www.einstein-website.de/z_biography/credo.html p. 48.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
Einstein was a [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]] and a supporter of the [[Ethical Culture|Ethical Culture movement]]. He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]].&lt;ref name="MercifulEnd"&gt;Dowbiggin, Ian (2003). ''A Merciful End''. New York: Oxford University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1AKtIEIIvUC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41.]&lt;/ref&gt; For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''New York Society for Ethical Culture'', he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."&lt;ref name="IdeasOpinions"&gt;Einstein, Albert (1995). ''Ideas And Opinions''. New York: Random House, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OeUoXHoAJMsC&amp;pg=PT62 p. 62.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an honorary associate of the British humanist organization the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and its journal was among the items present on his desk at his death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

With regard to punishment by God, Einstein stated, "I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms."&lt;ref&gt;Seldes, George (1996). ''The Great Thoughts''. New York: Ballantine Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZirsLPyzJEgC&amp;pg=PT273 p. 134.]&lt;/ref&gt; "A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes. Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death. It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees."&lt;ref&gt;Calaprice, Alice (2000). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BVp3QgAACAAJ The Expanded Quotable Einstein]''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&amp;pg=PA326 p. 216.] Albert Einstein, [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/einstein_religion.html "Religion and Science"] ''New York Times Magazine'' (9 Nov. 1930): 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the importance of ethics he wrote, "The most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life. To make this a living force and bring it to clear consciousness is perhaps the foremost task of education. The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action."&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Helen (1981). ''Albert Einstein, The Human Side''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5R7JsRRtoIC&amp;pg=PA95 p. 95.] Letter to a Brooklyn minister November 20, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; "I do not believe that a man should be restrained in his daily actions by being afraid of punishment after death or that he should do things only because in this way he will be rewarded after he dies. This does not make sense. The proper guidance during the life of a man should be the weight that he puts upon ethics and the amount of consideration that he has for others."&lt;ref&gt;Bucky, Peter (1992). ''The Private Albert Einstein''. Kansas City: Andrews &amp; McMeel, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; "I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic [[Causality (physics)|causality]] has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt by modern science. My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality is of the highest importance—but for us, not for God."&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Helen (1981). ''Albert Einstein, The Human Side''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5R7JsRRtoIC&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teleology===
In a conversation with Ugo Onufri in 1955, with regards to nature's purpose he said, "I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or goal, or anything that could be understood as anthropomorphic."&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;  In a 1947 letter he stated, "I feel also not able to imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere."&lt;ref name="Hoffmann95"/&gt;

===Epistemology===
====Naïve realism====
Einstein believed naïve realism was "relatively simple" to disprove. He agreed with [[Bertrand Russell]] that humans observe the effects objects have on them (greeness, coldness, hardness etc) and not the actual objects themselves.&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;

====Positivism====

Einstein declared that he was no [[positivism|positivist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ultimate Quotable Einstein|last=Einstein|first=Albert|last2=Dyson|first2=Freeman|last3=|first3=|work=From an interview with Alfred Stern, Contemporary Jewish Record (June 1945) 245-259|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=0691160147|editor-last=Calaprice|editor-first=Alice|location=|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained that we use with a certain right concepts to which there is no access from the materials of sensory experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Library of Living Philosophers|last=Albert|first=Einstein|publisher=|year=1944|isbn=|editor-last=Schilpp|editor-first=Paul Arthur|volume=V, ”The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell”|location=|pages=|at=”Remarks on Bertrand Russell’s Theory of Knowledge”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====[[Transcendental Idealism]]=====

Einstein considered that Kant’s "denial of the objectivity of space can (...) hardly be taken seriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinert|first=Friedel|date=October 2005|title=Einstein and Kant|url=https://raxional.com/einstein-and-kant/|journal=Philosophy|volume=80|issue=314|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that "if Kant had known what is known to us today of the natural order, I am certain that he would have fundamentally revised his philosophical conclusions. Kant built his structure upon the foundations of the world outlook of Kepler and Newton. Now that the foundation has been undermined, the structure no longer stands."&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;

===Opinions on philosophers===

====David Hume====

Einstein was an admirer of the philosophy of [[David Hume]]; in 1944 he said "If one reads Hume’s books, one is amazed that many and sometimes even highly esteemed philosophers after him have been able to write so much obscure stuff and even find grateful readers for it. Hume has permanently influenced the development of the best philosophers who came after him."&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;

====Immanuel Kant====
Albeit some sources maintain that Einstein read the three Critiques at the age of 16 and studied Kant as a teenager, Philip Stamp points out that this is contradicted by some of his own claims. For example, in 1949, Einstein said that he "did not grow up in the Kantian tradition, but came to understand the truly valuable which is to be found in his doctrine, alongside of errors which today are quite obvious, only quite late."&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;

In one of Einstein's letters in 1918 to [[Max Born]], Einstein said that he was starting to discover this "truly valuable" in Kant: "I am reading Kant’s ”[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena]]” here, among other things, and I am beginning to comprehend the enormous suggestive power that emanated from the fellow, and still does. Once you concede to him merely the existence of [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'' judgements]], you are trapped. Anyway it is nice to read him, even if it is not as good as his predecessor Hume’s work. Hume also had a far sounder instinct."&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;

Einstein explained the significance of Kant's philosophy as follows:

{{quotation|Hume saw that concepts which we must regard as essential, such as, for example, causal connection, cannot be gained from material given to us by the senses. This insight led him to a sceptical attitude as concerns knowledge of any kind. Man has an intense desire for assured knowledge. That is why Hume’s clear message seems crushing: the sensory raw material, the only source of our knowledge, through habit may lead us to belief and expectation but not to the knowledge and still less to the understanding of lawful relations. Then Kant took the stage with an idea which, though certainly untenable in the form in which he put it, signified a step towards the solution of Hume’s dilemma: if we have definitely assured knowledge, it must be grounded in reason itself.&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;}}

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
Schopenhauer's views on the independence of spatially separated systems influenced Einstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Howard|first=Don A.|title=Albert Einstein as a Philosopher of Science|date=December 2005|url=http://www3.nd.edu/~dhoward1/vol58no12p34_40.pdf|journal=Physics Today|volume=58|issue=12|pages=34–40|publisher=American Institute of Physics|format=PDF|bibcode=2005PhT....58l..34H|doi=10.1063/1.2169442|accessdate=2015-03-08|via=University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, author's personal webpage|quote=From Schopenhauer he had learned to regard the independence of spatially separated systems as, virtually, a necessary a priori assumption ... Einstein regarded his separation principle, descended from Schopenhauer's ''principium individuationis'', as virtually an axiom for any future fundamental physics. ... Schopenhauer stressed the essential structuring role of space and time in individuating physical systems and their evolving states. This view implies that difference of location suffices to make two systems different in the sense that each has its own real physical state, independent of the state of the other. For Schopenhauer, the mutual independence of spatially separated systems was a necessary a priori truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who called him a genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein: His Life and Universe|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|isbn=0743264746|location=New York|pages=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view it was a necessary assumption that the mere difference in location suffices to make two systems different, with the two states having their own real physical state, independent of the state of the other.

In Einstein's Berlin study three figures hung on the wall: [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein described, concerning the personal importance of Schopenhauer for him, Schopenhauer's words as "a continual consolation in the face of life’s hardships, my own and others’, and an unfailing wellspring of tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein: His Life and Universe|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schopenhauer's works are known for their pessimism, [[Konrad Wachsmann]] remembered, "He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he seemed so pleased, as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work."&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ernst Mach====
Einstein liked [[Ernst Mach]]'s scientific work, though not his philosophical work. He said "Mach was as good a scholar of mechanics as he was a deplorable philosopher".&lt;ref name="PhiloIdea"/&gt;

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

'''Religious liberalism''' is a conception of [[religion]] (or of a particular religion) which emphasizes personal and group [[liberty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=144}}: "[...] when people talk about 'religious liberalism,' they are normally referring to a commitment to a certain kind of conception of what religion is and, accordingly, of how religious attitudes, institutions, and communities should be developed or reshaped so as to accommodate and promote particular forms of personal and group freedom."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=159}}: "[...] religious liberalism came to be so concerned with respect for reason, reasonableness, and rationality [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attitude towards one's own religion (as opposed to [[criticism of religion]] from a [[secular]] position, and as opposed to criticism of a religion other than one's own) which contrasts with a traditionalist or [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] approach, and it is directly opposed by trends of [[religious fundamentalism]]. It is related to [[religious liberty]], which is the tolerance of different religious beliefs and practices, but not all promoters of religious liberty are in favor of religious liberalism, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1991|p=143–144}}: "However, given the way in which terminology has evolved, we must be careful not to assume too close an association between 'religious liberty' and 'religious liberalism.' Many people who think that religious liberty is basically a good thing that ought to be promoted do not wish to be regarded as advocates of religious liberalism; some of them even feel that many of those who call themselves 'religious liberals' are enemies of religious liberty, or at least end up undermining religious liberty in the process of promoting their own special brand of 'liberal religion.' [...] One notable problem here is that, when liberalism is considered in relation to religion, one may be thinking primarily of a certain 'liberal' conception of religion itself (in contrast with, say, orthodox, conservative, traditionalist, or fundamentalist conceptions) or one may be thinking more of a 'liberal' political view of the value of religious liberty. But, when people talk about 'religious liberalism,' they are usually thinking of the former more than the latter, although they may uncritically assume that the two necessarily accompany one another."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
"Liberalism" in the context of religious liberalism conveys the sense of [[classical liberalism]] as it developed in the [[Enlightenment era]], which forms the starting point of both religious and political liberalism; but religious liberalism does not necessarily coincide with all meanings of "liberalism" in [[political philosophy]]. For example, an [[Empirical research|empirical]] attempt to show a link between religious liberalism and political liberalism proved inconclusive in a 1973 study in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stellway |first=Richard J. |date=Summer 1973 |title=The correspondence between religious orientation and socio‐political liberalism and conservatism |journal=[[The Sociological Quarterly]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=430–439 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb00871.x |jstor=4105689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term "liberal" in the context of religious philosophy appeared as early as the mid-19th century&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; and became established by the first part of the 20th century; for example, in 1936, philosophy professor and [[Disciples of Christ]] minister Edward Scribner Ames wrote in his article "Liberalism in Religion":&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ames |first=Edward Scribner |date=July 1936 |title=Liberalism in religion |journal=[[International Journal of Ethics]] |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=429–443 |doi=10.1086/intejethi.46.4.2989282 |jstor=2989282 |url=https://digitalcommons.acu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&amp;context=crs_books}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The term "liberalism" seems to be developing a religious usage which gives it growing significance. It is more sharply contrasted with fundamentalism, and signifies a far deeper meaning than modernism. Fundamentalism describes a relatively uncritical attitude. In it custom, traditionalism, and authoritarianism are dominant. [...] There is no doubt that the loss of the traditional faith has left many people confused and rudderless, and they are finding that there is no adequate satisfaction in mere excitement or in flight from their finer ideals. They crave a sense of deeper meaning and direction for their life. Religious liberalism, not as a cult but as an attitude and method, turns to the living realities in the actual tasks of building more significant individual and collective human life.}}

Religious traditionalists, who reject the idea that tenets of modernity should have any impact on religious tradition, challenge the concept of religious liberalism. Secularists, who reject the idea that implementation of rationalistic or critical thought leaves any room for religion altogether, likewise dispute religious liberalism.

"[[Liberal Christianity]]" is an umbrella term for the developments in Christian theology and culture since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century. It has become mostly mainstream within the major [[Christian denominations]] in the [[Western world]], but is opposed by a movement of [[Christian fundamentalism]] which developed in response to these trends, and also contrasts with conservative forms of Christianity outside the Western world and outside the reach of Enlightenment philosophy and modernism, mostly within [[Eastern Christianity]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in particular has a long tradition of controversy regarding questions of religious liberalism. Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] (1801–1890), for example, was seen{{by whom|date=October 2015}} as moderately liberal by 19th-century standards because he was critical of [[papal infallibility]], but he explicitly opposed "liberalism in religion" because he argued it would lead to complete [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Liberalism in religion is the doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion, but that one creed is as good as another…", JH Newman 'Biglietto Speech' http://www.newmanreader.org/works/addresses/file2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglican Christian apologist [[C. S. Lewis]] voiced a similar view in the 20th century, arguing that "theology of the liberal type" amounted to a complete re-invention of Christianity and a rejection of Christianity as understood by its own founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |authorlink=C. S. Lewis |date=1988 |title=The essential C.S. Lewis |location=New York |publisher=[[Collier Books]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7YYhHvuNNzIC&amp;pg=PA353 353] |isbn=0020195508 |oclc=17840856 |quote=All theology of the liberal type involves at some point—and often involves throughout—the claim that the real behavior and purpose and teaching of Christ came very rapidly to be misunderstood and misrepresented by his followers, and has been recovered or exhumed only by modern scholars.}} (From an essay titled "Modern theology and biblical criticism" written in 1959.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the development of liberal theology in Christianity, German-Jewish religious reformers began to incorporate [[critical thought]] and humanist ideas into [[Judaism]] from the early 19th century. This resulted in the creation of various non-Orthodox denominations, from the moderately liberal [[Conservative Judaism]] to very liberal [[Reform Judaism]]. The moderate wing of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], especially [[Open Orthodoxy]], espouses a similar approach.

While Christianity and Judaism in the Western world have had to deal with [[modernity]] since its emergence in the 18th century—or even since the [[Renaissance]] and its consequences of [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]]&lt;ref name="Ames"/&gt;—[[Islam]] (along with Jewish and Christian traditions in the [[Middle East]]) was not immediately affected by modernity and Enlightenment philosophy. Examples of [[liberal movements within Islam]] are [[Progressive British Muslims]] (formed following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London terrorist attacks]], defunct by 2012), [[British Muslims for Secular Democracy]] (formed 2006), or [[Muslims for Progressive Values]] (formed 2007).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Similarly, [[Eastern religions]] were not immediately affected by liberalism and Enlightenment philosophy, and have partly undertaken reform movements only after contact with Western philosophy in the 19th or 20th centuries. Thus [[Hindu reform movements]] emerged in British India in the 19th century. [[Buddhist modernism]] (or "New Buddhism") arose in its Japanese form as a reaction to the [[Meiji Restoration]], and was again transformed outside of Japan in the 20th century, notably giving rise to modern [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMahan |first=David L. |date=2008 |title=The making of Buddhist modernism |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780195183276 |oclc=216938497 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183276.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Havnevik |editor1-first=Hanna |editor2-last=Hüsken |editor2-first=Ute |editor3-last=Teeuwen |editor3-first=Mark |editor4-last=Tikhonov |editor4-first=Vladimir |editor5-last=Wellens |editor5-first=Koen |date=2017 |title=Buddhist modernities: re-inventing tradition in the globalizing modern world |series=Routledge studies in religion |volume=54 |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781138687844 |oclc=970042282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberal religion in Unitarianism==
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
The term '''liberal religion''' has been used by [[Unitarianism|Unitarian Christians]]&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;For example: {{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=George Edward |authorlink=George Edward Ellis |date=November 1856 |title=Relations of reason and faith |journal=The Christian Examiner and Religious Miscellany |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=412–456 (444–445, 450) |location=Boston |publisher=Crosby, Nichols, and Company for the [[American Unitarian Association]] |oclc=6122907 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4g3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA412 |quote=The first of all the requisites in such a religion is that it shall be Liberal. We ''mention'' this condition even before that of Truth, because a religion that is not liberal cannot be true. The devout and intelligent demand a liberal religion, a religion large, free, generous, comprehensive in its lessons, a religion expansive in its spirit, lofty in its views, and with a sweep of blessings as wide as the range of man's necessities and sins. This is what is meant by a Liberal Religion, or Liberal views of religion, or Liberal Christianity. [...] Thoughtful, earnest, and devout minds now demand a liberal religion. Liberal in the honest, pure, and noble sense of that word. Not liberal in the sense of license, recklessness, or indifference; not in making a scoff of holy restraints and solemn mysteries. Not liberal as the worldling or the fool uses the word, for overthrowing all distinctions, and reducing life to a revel or a riot. [...] Such a faith cannot afford to raise an issue with reason on a single point, so far as their road on the highway of truth will allow them to keep company together. When they part for faith to advance beyond reason, they must part in perfect harmony.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Unitarian Universalist]]s&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Robert |date=1995 |chapter=The church green: ecology and the future |editor1-last=O'Neal |editor1-first=Dan |editor2-last=Wesley |editor2-first=Alice Blair |editor3-last=Ford |editor3-first=James Ishmael |editor3-link=James Ishmael Ford |title=The transient and permanent in liberal religion: reflections from the UUMA Convocation on Ministry |location=Boston |publisher=Skinner House Books |pages=195–206 (195) |isbn=1558963308 |oclc=35280453 |quote=Does liberal religion have a future? If we answer in the affirmative, can we begin to imagine the outlines of liberal religion in the next century? What will the Unitarian Universalist movement look like in the decade of the 2090s?}} ''Cf.'' {{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Robert L'H. |date=Spring 1976 |title=The religious value system of Unitarian Universalists |journal=[[Review of Religious Research]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=189–208 |doi=10.2307/3510610 |jstor=3510610 |quote=The repetition of the distinctive pattern in both higher and lower ranking of both terminal and instrumental values leads one to a firmer basis for sensing a distinctive Unitarian Universalist pattern of religiousness. It is, perhaps, more accurately defined as a pattern of liberal religion which further research may disclose is typical, for example, of such groups as Reform Judaism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to their own brand of religious liberalism, although the term has also been used by non-Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;For example, on [[Quakerism]] as liberal religion: {{cite book |editor1-last=Dandelion |editor1-first=Pink |editor2-last=Collins |editor2-first=Peter |date=2008 |title=The Quaker condition: the sociology of a liberal religion |location=Newcastle |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=18 |isbn=9781847185655 |oclc=227278348 |quote=This is the first book of its kind and is intended to be the beginning, rather than the final word. It adds considerably to the study of Quakerism but also to the study of Liberal religion per se.}} And on [[Islam]] as liberal religion: {{cite journal |last=Foody |first=Kathleen |date=October 2016 |title=Pedagogical projects: teaching liberal religion after 9/11 |journal=The Muslim World |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=719–739 |doi=10.1111/muwo.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Journal of Liberal Religion'' was published by the Unitarian Ministerial Union, [[Meadville Theological School]], and Universalist Ministerial Association from 1939 to 1949, and was edited by [[James Luther Adams]], an influential Unitarian theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of Liberal Religion |website=worldcat.org |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/4714979 |oclc=4714979 |accessdate=2017-11-20}} Published from 1939 to 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, a new version of the journal was published in an online format from 1999 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Journal of Liberal Religion |url=http://www.meadville.edu/page.php?page=71 |website=meadville.edu |issn=1527-9324 |accessdate=2017-11-22}} Published from 1999 to 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religism''' is the tendency to believe in [[religious]] [[ideologies]] as opposed to [[Rationality|rational]] facts.
In many [[country|countries]] religism is preventing development towards a more modern society in either [[Human Development Index|material living conditions]] or [[human freedom]].
To the extreme religism can result in death by refusing a [[medical treatment]] to a patient because of religious beliefs.
Religism can also prevent people from choosing a loved partner or impede them access to a profession or an activity they would like to do.
Sometimes it also bars access to certain [[food]] types even in case of hunger.
Religism is often associated to an extreme grip of traditions and usually put a religion above rational thinking.

[[File:Rangoli.jpg|thumb|''[[Rangoli]]'', a popular form of [[Indian art|Indian Sand Paintings]], in [[Singapore]].]]
'''Sandpainting''' is the art of pouring coloured sands, and powdered pigments from minerals or crystals, or pigments from other natural or synthetic sources onto a surface to make a fixed, or unfixed sand painting. Unfixed sand paintings have a long established cultural history in numerous social groupings around the globe, and are often temporary, ritual paintings prepared for religious or healing ceremonies.  It is also referred to as drypainting.

Drypainting is practised by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the Southwestern United States, by [[Tibet]]an and Buddhist monks, as well as [[Australian Aborigines]], and also by Latin Americans on certain Christian holy days.

==History==

=== Native American sandpainting ===
[[File:Navajo sandpainting.jpg|thumb|Navajo sandpainting, photogravure by [[Edward S. Curtis]], 1907, Library of Congress]]

In the sandpainting of southwestern Native Americans (the most famous of which are the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] (known as the Diné)), the [[Medicine Man]] (or ''Hatałii'') paints loosely upon the ground of a [[hogan]], where the ceremony takes place, or on a [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] or cloth tarpaulin, by letting the coloured [[sand]]s flow through his fingers with control and skill. There are 600 to 1,000 different traditional designs for sandpaintings known to the Navajo. They do not view the paintings as static objects, but as spiritual, living beings to be treated with great respect. More than 30 different sandpaintings may be associated with one ceremony.

The colours for the painting are usually accomplished with naturally coloured sand, crushed [[gypsum]] (white), yellow [[ochre]], red [[sandstone]], [[charcoal]] and a mixture of charcoal and gypsum (blue). Brown can be made by mixing red and black; red and white make pink. Other colouring agents include corn meal, flower [[pollen]], or powdered roots and bark.

The paintings are for [[healing]] purposes only. Many of them contain images of ''[[Yeii|Yeibicheii]]'' (the Holy People). While creating the painting, the medicine man will [[chant]], asking the ''yeibicheii'' to come into the painting and help heal the patient.

When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and [[symmetry]] of the painting symbolise the harmony which a patient wishes to reestablish in his or her life. The accuracy of a sandpainting is believed to determine its efficacy as a sacred tool. The patient will be asked to sit on the sandpainting as the medicine man proceeds with the healing chant. It is claimed the sandpainting acts as a portal to attract the spirits and allow them to come and go. Practitioners believe sitting on the sandpainting helps the patient to absorb spiritual power, while in turn the Holy People will absorb the illness and take it away. Afterward, when the sandpainting has served its purpose, it is considered to be toxic, since it has absorbed the illness. For this reason, the painting is destroyed. Because of the sacred nature of the ceremonies, the sandpaintings are begun, finished, used and destroyed within 12 hours.

[[File:Navajo sand painting (00171124).jpg|thumb|left|Navajo sandpainting, photo by [[H.S. Poley]], published c. 1890-1908, Library of Congress]]

The ceremonies involving sandpaintings are usually done in sequences, termed "chants", lasting a certain number of days depending on the ceremony. At least one fresh, new sandpainting is made for each day.

Some Navajo laws and taboos relate to the sandpaintings, and protect their holiness:
* Women of child-bearing age are not supposed to sing the chants associated with the ''yeibicheii''. This is both because the ceremony has a possibility of injuring an unborn child, and because of a taboo preventing menstruating women from attending. (Some cultures considered menstruation and presence of blood to be powerful spiritual events that had to be restrained, as they represented life forces.) Post-menopausal women are more likely to be chanters or diagnosticians.
* Authentic sandpaintings are rarely photographed, so as to not disrupt the flow of the ceremony. For many reasons, medicine men will seldom allow outsiders inside a sacred ceremony. Because so many outsiders are curious about sandpainting, some medicine men may create pieces for exhibition purposes only, using reversed colours and variations. To create an authentic sandpainting solely for viewing would be a [[Sacrilege|profane]] act. The sandpaintings for sale in shops and on the Internet are commercially produced and contain deliberate errors, as the real sandpaintings are considered sacred.
* The earliest credited instance of traditional Navajo sandpaintings (being rendered in coloured sands as opposed to tapestry or other media) being created in a permanent form for sale, have been traced to between 1945 and 1955. The main credit is generally given to a Navajo Hatałii named [[Fred Stevens, Jr. (Grey Squirrel)]], who developed the primary method of "permatizing" for commercial sandpaintings that is still used.&lt;ref name=Parezo&gt;Parezo, Nancy J.

===Indigenous Australian sandpainting===
[[File:Alice Springs4263.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork in Alice Springs]]
[[Indigenous Australian art]] has a history which covers more than 30,000 years, and a wide range of native traditions and styles.  These have been studied in recent decades and their complexity has gained increased international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Caruna, W.(2003) ''Aboriginal Art'', Thames and Hudson, London, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Aboriginal Art covers a wide variety of media, including sandpainting, painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture, and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic embellishments found on weaponry and also tools.  Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture.  It was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about "[[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]]".



Aboriginal people have taken to transforming their tradition sand paintings into more permanent forms using modern techniques and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartdirectory.com/news/feature/ngurrara-the-great-sandy-desert-canvas.php|title=Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas Australian Aboriginal Art Feature at the Aboriginal Art Directory. View information about Ngurrara: The Great Sandy Desert Canvas|first=Aboriginal Art|last=Directory|date=|website=www.aboriginalartdirectory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Bardon]] was an Australian art teacher who was instrumental in creating the [[Aboriginal art of the Western Desert]] movement, and in bringing Australian indigenous art to the attention of the world."... [directed by Bardon, the elders] began to interact with certain issues in 1960s and 70s international painting, especially the extreme schematisation of New York minimalism." In the [[History of Painting]]"Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterised by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the fluxus movement and postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969)&lt;ref name="sxdvrz"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression."

This connection is seen most obviously in the connection between the paintings from the late sixties of [[Peter Young (artist)]] and the paintings that follow in the early seventies produced in the [[Papunya Tula]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?ViewID=1&amp;MnuID=SRCH&amp;GalID=1&amp;SubViewID=1&amp;BioArtistIRN=22094&amp;IRN=36943]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://algusgreenspon.com/wp-content/files_mf/1362697627PY_ARtforum_1971.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232257/http://algusgreenspon.com/wp-content/files_mf/1362697627PY_ARtforum_1971.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papunya Tula]], or Papunya Tula Artists Pty Ltd, is an artist cooperative formed in 1972 that is owned and operated by Aboriginal people from the Western Desert of Australia. [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]] is one of the early Papunya Tula artists and is known for ''[[Gulgardi]]''. It is notable for being the first work by an Indigenous Australian artist to win a contemporary art award, and the first public recognition of a Papunya painting.&lt;ref name=Parezo/&gt;

=== Tibetan sandpainting ===
{{Main|Sand mandala}}[[File:348Sandbild im Sera Kloster.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala made of sand in the Sera Monastery, Lhasa]]
[[File:MandalaSable2008-05.JPG|Mandala Sable 2008-05 showing the use of [[Chak-pur]]|thumb|left]]
[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sand paintings usually composed ''[[mandala]]s''. In Tibetan, it is called ''dul-tson-kyil-khor'' (mandala of coloured powders).
The sand is carefully placed on a large, flat table.  The construction process takes several days, and the mandala is destroyed shortly after its completion.  This is done as a teaching tool and metaphor for the "impermanence" (Pali: ''[[anicca]]'') of all contingent and compounded phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[Pratītya-samutpāda]]'').

The mandala sand-painting process begins with an opening ceremony, during which the ''[[lama]]s'', or Tibetan priests, consecrate the site and call forth the forces of goodness.  They chant, declare intention, ''[[mudra]]'', ''[[asana]]'', ''[[pranayama]]'', do visualisations, play music, recite ''[[mantra]]s'', etc.
[[File:Mandala zel-tary.jpg|thumb|right|Mandala zel-tary using [[Vajra]] to ceremoniously divide the painting]]
[[File:Tibetan monks, Twentse Welle.JPG|thumb|left|Tibetan monks in a ceremony after having broken their mandala, Twentse Welle]]
On the first day, the lamas begin by drawing an outline of the mandala to be painted on a wooden platform.  The following days see the laying of the coloured sands, which is effected by pouring the sand from traditional metal funnels called '''[[chak-pur]]'''. Each monk holds a ''chak-pur'' in one hand, while running a metal rod on its serrated surface; the vibration causes the sands to flow like liquid.
Formed of traditional prescribed [[iconography]] that includes [[List of geometric shapes|geometric shapes]] and a multitude of ancient spiritual symbols (e.g.: [[Ashtamangala]] and divine attributes of ''[[yidam]]''), [[seed syllables]], [[mantra]], the sand-painted mandala is used as a tool or instrument for innumerable purposes.  A primary purpose is to reconsecrate the earth and its inhabitants.
When the meditation is complete, the sand painting is ceremoniously destroyed using a [[Vajra]] and the sand is then gathered and taken to a body of water for offering.

===Japanese tray pictures===
From the 15th century in Japan, [[Buddhist]] artists in the times of the ''[[shōgun]]s'' practised the craft of ''[[bonseki]]'' by sprinkling dry coloured sand and pebbles onto the surface of plain black lacquered trays.  They used bird feathers as brushes to form the sandy surface into seascapes and landscapes.  These tray pictures were used in religious ceremonies.  Japanese esoteric Buddhism was transmitted from East Central Asia after the 8th century, and thus these Japanese Buddhist sandpaintings may share earlier historical roots with the more intricate brightly coloured Buddhist sand mandalas created by Tibetan Buddhist monks.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Table decking===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the royal courts of Europe employed "table deckers", who decorated the side tables at royal banquets having adapted the craft of 'bonseki' from the Japanese. The table deckers sprinkled coloured sands, marble dust, sugars, etc. upon the surface of plain white tablecloths to create unfixed pictures of fruit, flowers, birds and rustic scenery. In between each design spaces were left for fruit bowls and sweetmeat dishes so that the diners could refresh themselves in between the main courses of the feast. These ornate pictures were discarded along with the debris of the feast.

As a fine example of the table deckers' craft, [[Woburn Abbey]] in [[Bedfordshire]], England possesses an ornate [[folding screen]] with three panels, decorated with sand pictures protected by glass.  The centre one has five spaces for [[sweetmeat]] pyramid dishes while the two side leaves of the screen have three spaces for fruit trays.  There are four sand pictures in each corner of the side panels of the screen, featuring 18th-century pastoral scenes, while the remaining areas of the screen are decorated with butterflies, doves, fruit, flowers, etc. The screen would be laid upon the surface of a side table.  It doubled as a serving base for elaborate porcelain dishes and glass trays containing fruits, bonbons and sweetmeats, from which the hosts and their guests could help themselves while socialising or stretching their legs between the multiple courses being served on the main table in the dining hall.  This screen may have been the work of the German artisan [[F. Schweikhardt]], who specialised in still-life studies in the style of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Jan van Huysum]].

===Georgian sandpainting===
[[File:"The Hermit" - Sand Painting by Benjamin Zobel.jpg|thumb|''A Hermit by a Wayside Shrine'' by Benjamin Zobel (early 19th century)]]
Sandpainting as a craft was inspired by King George III, who was a skilled watchmaker and craftsman in his own right, and took an interest in the skills demonstrated by royal functionaries, known as Table Deckers, who decorated the white table-cloths at royal banquets with ornate centre-pieces decorated by using unfixed coloured sands and sugars as 'paint', and a bird's feather as a 'brush' a craft introduced by a European traveller who had observed the craftsmen at work in Japan.

It was while watching the table deckers at work the King suggested that if the sand pictures being temporarily laid out upon the surface of the tablecloths could be fixed permanently in place rather than being discarded with the remains of the feast, this would save much time and energy employing a multitude of skilled embroiderers toiling over such skilled work. So on one occasion the King bellowed to the craftsmen, "Why don't you fix it!" This set a number of craftsmen including Haas, Schweikhardt and [[Benjamin Zobel]] (Memmingen, Germany, 21 September 1762 - London, England, 24 October 1830), all of German origin, to, independently of each other, successfully develop suitable methods to achieve this goal, and these pictures were commissioned by the royal worthies of the day and became highly prized by the aristocracy. [[Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany|The King's brother]], the Duke of York, commissioned a number of works by Zobel and the others, although the sand artists jealously guarded their method from their competitors.
Zobel depicted "pigs in the manner of Morland"; "Nelson", the favourite dog of the Duke of York; "Tiger after George Stubbs", and an impressive "Vulture and snake."{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
Although many of Zobel's works have survived, few of those by Haas have survived the passage of time, although observers considered his work superior to that of Zobel. This may reflect the differing techniques used by each artist. A diarist observed Zobel's coating the surface of the baseboard with a mixture of [[gum arabic]] and [[white lead]] and sprinkling sand upon the sticky surface using a folded paper [[funnel]] as a brush. He had to work quickly since the adhesive would dry in a few hours. Several of his surviving pictures have unfinished work on the reverse. Haas followed more closely the techniques developed in Japan, but mixing dry powdered gum arabic with the sand, sprinkling the mixture through a sieve and using feathers as brushes to create the pictures upon the baseboard, then fixing them by some method which he kept a secret. Due to the damp conditions in many of the stately homes of the day, his pictures failed to last more than a few years. On one occasion Haas was called away while working on an unfixed sand picture. When he returned he found one of Windsor Castle's cats curled up on the picture, thus damaging it!

Eventually Zobel returned to [[Memmingen]] in Bavaria where he continued to successfully pursue his craft. Some of his work is displayed in Memmingen Town Hall. Haas was forced to give up sand painting, probably due to the ongoing disasters with his pictures. He opened a bakery in Windsor instead, and the icing on his cakes may well have been decorated with pictures in coloured sugar instead of sand.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

With the passing of these Georgian craftsmen and the disposal of the Duke of York's collection the interest and skills evolved in sand picture work declined. The only Royal personage to take further interest in the craft was the late Queen Mary, consort to King George V, who bequeathed her Georgian sand paintings to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and her collection of [[Isle of Wight]] sand pictures to [[Carisbrooke Castle|Carisbrooke Castle Museum]] on the Isle of Wight.

In the first half of the 20th century Lt. Colonel Rybot was a keen collector of sand paintings, which were the source material of the articles written on the subject in the arts and crafts magazines of the day. Eventually 37 of his collection of sand paintings were the main feature at an auction held at [[Sotheby's]] New Bond Street gallery on 15 June 1956.

===Victorian sand picture souvenirs===

Thousands of sites exist where it is possible to collect natural coloured sands for craftwork, with an enormous range of colours being available around the globe varying with the contents of the mineral charged waters leaching through the sands. But for the tourist the vertical sand cliffs at [[Alum Bay]] on the Isle of Wight form the central portion of a visual geological phenomenon (best viewed after a shower of rain) which encapsulates the impressive chalk spires of [[The Needles]] and [[Tennyson Downs]]. Although tourists are no longer encouraged to obtain their own sand from the cliffs, numerous companies on the Island sell sand for the purpose of Sandpainting.

After her marriage to Prince Albert and having chosen [[Osborne House]] near [[Cowes]] to be her new family retreat, [[Queen Victoria]] was the prime mover in the gentrification of this former backwater, local artisans benefitted from the influx of wealthy visitors, and a number of craftsmen sold their fixed sand pictures and unfixed sand jars featuring views of the Island as unique keepsakes of the Isle of Wight.

Some of these sand pictures were small and crude and left unsigned, but Edwin and John Dore of Arreton produced some fine work in the 1840s. The pictures were of postcard size and the subject matter local views such as Carisbrooke Castle, and other touristy subjects. Edwin always signed his quaint pictures in a fine hand with a mapping pen and Indian ink, one of his most successful mass-produced subjects being 'Collecting birds eggs on Needles Cliffs'. John Dore used a card embellished with a printed border of lace design on which to execute his sand pictures although the quality of his work was inferior to that of his brother.

Few of the Island sand artists filled in the sky, giving that detail a light colourwash as a finishing touch, sometimes leaving doors and windows free of sand which would be blocked in with Indian ink. In the 1860s and 1870s J. Symons of Cowes kept up the good work, producing local views much larger than postcard size, mounted in glazed oak or maple frames and signed with the artist's signature on the reverse.
The father and son team the Neates of Newport sold their works from a stall outside Carisbrooke Castle gates where visitors were offered sand pictures and sand jars priced from 1/- to 2/6 each and the son grew his fingernails abnormally long in order to distribute the sand on his pictures.
During the 1930s and 1940s R.J.Snow of Lake came nearest to producing sand pictures in the manner of the Georgian craftsmen, but postcard size, although he did produce some fine commissioned work, particularly a view of Oddicombe in Devon, in which the sea and sky were also 'painted' in sand, but after the war years the quality of the postcard sand pictures deteriorated with the mass-produced article with little taste or skill being offered for sale for a few shillings.

In Senegal, designs are glued to board and are typically of figures in the landscape.

===Sand bottles===

[[File:Sand Bottle - Andrew Clemens, 1879.jpg|thumb|right|Sand bottle by Andrew Clemens, 1879]]

In the 1860s to 1890s, [[Andrew Clemens]] a [[deaf mute]] born in Dubuque, Iowa, USA became famous for his craft of creating unfixed pictures using multicoloured sands compressed inside glass bottles or ornate chemist jars. The sand was collected from the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. The subjects of his sand bottles included ornately decorated sentimental verses, sailing ships, plants, animals and portraits. 

He exhibited his work at the St. Louis trade fair and having spent hours creating a picture in a bottle would demonstrate to an incredulous audience that the picture inside was unfixed by destroying the bottle with a hammer. Clemens' sand bottles have become museum pieces and highly prized antiques which have since sold at auction for thousands of US dollars.

===Sand carpets===
[[File:Zandtapijt in Drentse keuken.jpg|thumb|Sandpainting on the tiled floor (on the wall are handpainted decorated tiles)]]
[[File:Plaza-centro.jpg|thumb|"Carpet" of land in the Town Hall Square in La Orotava [[Tenerife]] in celebration of Corpus Christi.]]
In the province of [[Drenthe]] in the Netherlands in the late 19th, early 20th centuries it was custom to use a stiff broom to sweep patterns in white sand to form simple decorations on the tiled floors of the houses, mostly for special occasions or celebrations. The next day it was swept up.
This custom was also practised in Northern Belgium by the Dutch speaking communities while in
Hekelgem, 1973 was the centenary year of the craft of "Old Zandtapijt". The hotels and cafes would employ artisans to strew ornate sand pictures in unfixed coloured sands on the tiled floors of their premises to encourage passing tourists to halt and enjoy local hospitality on their way towards Brussels. Roger de Boeck, born in 1930, was a well-respected exponent of this craft, who used glue to fix his sand pictures to a suitable base selling them to visitors to his atelier. In addition to biblical scenes, his finest works included a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] 1953, and [[John F. Kennedy|US president John Kennedy]], in the early 60s. This craft continues, and a booklet to celebrate the centenary was published on 1 February 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Hekelgemse zandschilderkunst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern culture==
[[File:Asynchronous Syntropy.jpg|thumb|left|"Asynchronous [[Syntropy]]" painting using coloured sand as seen at The Museum of Arts and Design "Swept Away" exhibit May 2012]]
In modern days, sandpainting is most often practised during [[Day of the Dead|Dia de los Muertos]] (Day of the Dead) in Mexico and the United States. Streets are decorated with sand paintings that are later swept away, symbolising the fleeting nature of life. Of note are the sandpaintings done during the [[Seattle]] [[Festál#Mexico: Día de Muertos|Dia De Muertos Festival]], but the most exciting development has been the Performance Art of Sand Animation which has created a new wave of younger artists and also revived interest in all types of sand painting.

A number of [[contemporary art]]ists use sand in ways that depart from specific cultural traditions exploring techniques by raking sand, pouring it, carving it, creating unique designs. The works are [[ephemeral]] and are primarily shared through documentation or part of a live performance.

===Present-day sand painting techniques===
[[File:Sand Painting of Mrs. Thatcher the 'Iron Lady' incorporating magnetised iron filings in the composition.jpg|thumb|upright|Brian Pike's 1985 portrait of [[Margaret Thatcher]] incorporates magnetised iron filings in the composition]]

Most artists use naturally occurring oxidised and mineral-charged coloured sands, adding powdered charcoal to widen the palette and in some instances idiosyncratic materials such as iron filings or discarded stonemasons' dust from ecclesiastical sites. Other artists use industrial tinted [[quartz]] sands with a capacity to resist [[intemperie]] action and a new generation of strong adhesives.  The work is protected with a coat of spray varnish. No protective glass frame is needed with the sands and the adhesives since the paintings have proved to resist the effect of direct sunlight without any yellowing of the varnish

The '''September 2010 Quetta bombing''' occurred on 3 September 2010 in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="bbc20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11177686|title=Quetta rally suicide bomb kills dozens|date=3 September 2010|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 73 people&lt;ref name="zinhua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-09/04/c_13477555.htm|title=73 killed in fresh suicide bomb attack in Pakistan|date=4 September 2010|agency=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed and 160 injured when a bomb exploded in a [[Quds Day]] procession which [[Shia]]s were carrying out to express solidarity with Palestinians.&lt;ref name="cnn20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/09/03/pakistan.violence/|title=Pakistan suicide bombing kills 59, injures 160, police say|date=3 September 2010|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/04/world/asia/04pstan.html|title=Taliban Claim Deadly Attack on Shiites in Pakistan|last=Masood|first=Salman|date=3 September 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Pakistan, which has a mostly [[Sunni]] population, has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias, who account for about 35–40% of Pakistan's population, and are the followers of the Prophet's progeny.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt; Two days prior to these attacks dozens of Shias were killed in a similar [[September 2010 Lahore bombings|attack]] in [[Lahore]]. Sunni militant groups like [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] which operate freely in Pakistan have for years targeted minorities including Shias.

On the day prior to this attack Pakistan's interior minister [[Rehman Malik]] had asked the Shia community not to hold large gatherings due to security concerns.&lt;ref name="lat20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-blast-20100904,0,6390463.story|title=Pakistan suicide bombing kills 58|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|date=3 September 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The procession was to mark the Quds Day event staged every year by the Shia community to oppose Israel's occupation of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="dawn20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/03-blast-near-meezan-chowk-in-quetta-ss-09|title=Suicide bomber kills 53 at Shia rally in Quetta|date=3 September 2010|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally drew an estimated 2,500 participants, mostly Shiias. The size of the blast caused a stampede.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt; The explosion occurred in the Meezan chowk area of the town. The bomb exploded around 3:05&amp;nbsp;pm local time. It was estimated that the suicide bomber used about 15 kilograms of explosives.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"/&gt;

===Responsibility===
[[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] claimed responsibility for the attack and said a 22-year-old suicide bomber, Rashid Moaawia, carried out the attack.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-09/03/c_13477509.htm|title=L-e-J group claims responsibility for suicide blast in Pakistan's Quetta|date=3 September 2010|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the blast, widespread protests erupted in the city with gunfire being heard across the city. Several shops were burnt by the protesters.&lt;ref name="xinhua2010"/&gt; People were seen lying on the roads to avoid gunfire, while others set fire to vehicles and buildings to vent their anger.&lt;ref name="dawn20100903"/&gt;

After the blast, police cordoned off the area and fired in the air to hold back people trying to search for their relatives.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt;

Thousands have attended a funeral in the Pakistani city of Quetta for victims of a suicide attack on a Shia Muslim procession.

The death toll from Friday's attack rose from 43 to 65 overnight as critically wounded people died in hospitals, police said on Saturday.

Shops and schools remained closed the following day. Security was also stepped up at mosques across Pakistan.

Thousands attended a funeral mass in Quetta.&lt;ref name="aje20100904x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/2010948413333315.html|title=Pakistan mourns blast victims|date=4 September 2010|publisher=Al Jazeerah English|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] told the press that militants want to encourage sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government following a series of military offensives against them. He also claimed that Punjabi, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban are one and the same.&lt;ref name="voa20100904"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Pakistani-Flooding-to-Affect-Fight-Against-Militants-102218169.html|title=Pakistani Flooding Impacts Fight Against Militants|date=4 September 2010|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shiite Conference, Balochistan'' announced a 40-day mourning period in line with Shia custom.&lt;ref name="zinhua"/&gt;

UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]]'s spokesman said "These attacks, which deliberately targeted Shiite Muslims and killed or injured scores of civilians, are unacceptable."&lt;ref name="UN20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35821&amp;Cr=pakistan&amp;Cr1=|title=UN chief deplores deadly attacks against Pakistan’s Shiite Muslims|date=3 September 2010|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condemning the attacks the [[White House]] stated "To target innocent civilians during the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]] at an already difficult time as the country is working hard to recover from [[2010 Pakistan floods|terrible flooding]] caused by monsoons makes these acts even more reprehensible."&lt;ref name="afp20100903"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hWrPLE_lAq_hxdByLfIiuCYPQemw|title=US condemns 'reprehensible' Pakistan bombings|date=3 September 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[religion|religious]] context, '''sin''' is an act of transgression against [[divine law|divine]] or [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sin|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin can also be viewed as any thought or action that endangers the ideal relationship between an individual and [[God]]; or as any diversion from the perceived ideal order for human [[Life|living]]. In [[Jainism]], sin refers to anything that harms the possibility of the ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (being) to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (supreme emancipation). In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]). [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] as a sin.

== Etymology ==
The word derives from "[[Old English]] ''syn(n)'', for original *''sunjō''. The stem may be related to that of Latin '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''sons'', ''sont-is''' guilty. In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/180030?isAdvanced=false&amp;result=1&amp;rskey=9Bb3P3&amp; |title=sin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English Biblical terms translated as "sin" or "syn" from the Biblical Greek and Jewish terms sometimes originate from words in the latter languages denoting the act or state of missing the mark; the original sense of [[New Testament Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁμαρτία}} ''hamartia'' "sin", is failure, being in error, missing the mark, especially in spear throwing;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(marti/a|ἁμαρτία}}, {{LSJ|a(marta/nw|ἁμαρτάνω|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish views on sin|Hebrew ''hata'' "sin"]] originates in [[archery]] and literally refers to missing the "gold" at the centre of a target, but hitting the target, i.e. error.&lt;ref&gt;
Pagels, Elaine. ''The Gnostic Gospels''. Vintage Books: New York, 1989. p. 123.
&lt;/ref&gt; "To sin" has been defined from a Greek [[Bible concordance|concordance]] as "to miss the mark".&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/hamartia.html "Hamartia,"] ''The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] eventually (after the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian controversy]]) defined sin as a hardened heart, a loss of love for God, a disposition of the heart to depart from God because of inordinate self-love (see Augustine ''On Grace and Free Will'' in ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P. Holmes, vol. 5, 30-31 [14-15]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==

=== Bahá'í ===
{{Anchor| Bahá'í faith }}
{{Main|Bahá'í views on sin}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], humans are considered naturally good (perfect), fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love. However, the Bahá'í teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Buddhist views on sin}}

[[Buddhism]] believes in the principle of ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', whereby [[Dukkha|suffering]] is the inevitable consequence of greed, anger, and delusion (known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three poisons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, "Three Poisons": "Greed, anger, and foolishness. The fundamental evils inherent in life that give rise to human suffering."&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct Buddhist equivalent of the Abrahamic concept of sin, wrongdoing is recognized in Buddhism. The concept of [[Buddhist ethics]] is [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] in nature and is not based upon duty towards any deity.
Karma means action, and in Buddhist context, motivation is the most important aspect of an action. Whether karma done with mind, body and/or speech is called 'good' or 'bad', depends on whether it would bring pleasant or unpleasant results to the person who does the action. 
One needs to purify negative karma [[Satipatthana Sutta|Four Satipatthanas]] to free oneself from obstacles to liberation from the vicious circle of rebirth. The purification reduces suffering and in the end one reaches [[Nirvana]], the ultimate purification by realizing selflessness or emptiness. An enlightened being is free of all the suffering and karmas, and will not be automatically born again.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden|expulsion]] of [[Adam and Eve]] for [[Original sin|transgressing God's command]] not to eat [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].]]
{{Main|Hamartiology|Christian views on sin}}
{{See also|Christian views on the Old Covenant|Seven deadly sins}}
In the [[Old Testament]], some sins were [[Religion and capital punishment#Christianity|punishable by death]] in different forms, while most sins are forgiven by burnt offerings. [[Christians]] consider the [[Mosaic covenant|Old Covenant]] to be fulfilled by the [[The gospel|Gospel]].

In the [[New Testament]] the [[Atonement in Christianity|forgiveness of sin]] is effected through [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] and [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] ([[Mark 1]]:15).&lt;ref&gt;Mark 1:15&lt;/ref&gt; Sin is [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiven]] when the sinner acknowledges, [[Confession (religion)#Christianity|confesses]], and repents for their sin as a part of believing in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Michael|title=Dogma: The Church as Sacrament|date=1975|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-7425-3203-8|page=220,222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5oTziWXEKgC&amp;pg=PA220|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sinner is expected to confess his sins to [[God in Christianity|God]] as a part of an ongoing relationship, which also includes [[Gratitude#Christian conceptions|giving thanks]] to God. The sinful person has never before been in a favorable relationship with God. When, as a part of the process of salvation, a person is forgiven, they enter into a [[Union with Christ|union with God]] which abides forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willmington|first1=H.L.|title=Willmington's Guide to the Bible|date=1981|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.|isbn=0-8423-8804-4|page=725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeCN2cVnONYC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Epistle to the Romans]] [[Romans 6:23|6:23]], it is mentioned that "the wages of sin is death", which is commonly interpreted as, if one repents for his sins, such person will inherit [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romans 6:23|url=https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm|website=Biblehub|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jewish Christianity]], sin is believed to alienate the sinner from God even though He has extreme [[Agape|love for mankind]]. It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God. That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death on the cross]] as a [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfactory sacrifice]] for the sins of humanity. Humanity was [[Destiny#Religion|destined]] for life with God when [[Adam]] disobeyed God. The Bible in [[John 3:16]] says "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting."

In [[Eastern Christianity]], sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships, both among people and likewise between people and God. Also as in Jewish Christianity, Sin is likewise seen as [[Fall of man|the refusal]] to follow [[Will of God|God's plan]] and the desire to be "like God" (as stated in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:5) and thus in direct opposition to God's will (see the account of [[Adam and Eve]] in Genesis).

{{Anchor|Original sin}}
[[Original sin]] is a Western concept that states that sin entered the human world through [[Adam and Eve]]'s sin in the [[Garden of Eden]] and that human beings have since lived with the consequences of this first sin.&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|title=Original Sin|work=Catholic Encyclopedia|date=1 February 1911 |accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|The serpent]] who beguiled [[Eve]] to eat of [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] was punished by having it and its kind being made to crawl on the ground and God set an enmity between them and [[Genealogies of Genesis|Eve's descendants]] (Genesis 3:14-15). Eve was punished by the pains of childbirth and the sorrow of bringing about life that would eventually age, sicken and die (Genesis 3:16). The second part of the curse about being [[Fall of man#Subordination|subordinate to Adam]] originates from her creation from one of Adam's ribs to be his helper ([[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis 2:18-25]]); the curse now clarifies that she must now obey her [[Christian views on marriage|husband]] and desire only him. Adam was punished by having to work endlessly to feed himself and his family. The land would bring forth both thistles and thorns to be cleared and herbs and grain [[Religion and agriculture|to be planted, nurtured, and harvested]]. The second part of the curse about his mortality is from his origin as red clay - he is from the land and he and his descendants would return to it when [[Christian burial|buried]] after death. When Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain slew his brother Abel]], he introduced murder into the world (Genesis 4:8-10). For his punishment, God banished him as a fugitive, but first [[Curse and mark of Cain|marked him]] with a sign that would protect him and his descendants from harm (Genesis 4:11-16).

One concept of sin deals with things that exist on Earth, but not in [[Heaven in Christianity|Heaven]]. Food, for example, while a necessary good for the (health of the [[Temporality|temporal]]) body, is not of ([[eternity|eternal]]) transcendental living and therefore its ''excessive'' [[Gluttony|savoring]] is considered a sin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated18"&gt;Hanegraaff, Hank. ''The Bible Answer Book'' pp. 18-21. {{ISBN|0-8499-9544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unforgivable sin (or [[eternal sin]]) is a sin that can never be forgiven;
Matthew 12:30-32 :
" &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; And Therefore I say to you: Every sin and [[Blasphemy#Christianity|blasphemy]] shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; And whosoever shall speak a word against the [[Son of man]], it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the [[Holy Ghost]], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come."

In [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Christianity sins are classified into grave sins called [[mortal sin]]s and less serious sins called [[venial sin]]. Mortal sins cause one to lose salvation unless the sinner repents and venial sins require some sort of penance either on Earth or in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church No. 1472|location=The Vatican|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1472.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus was said to have paid for the complete mass of sins past, present, and to come in future. Even inevitable sin is said to have already been cleansed.

The [[Lamb of God]] was and is God himself and is therefore sinless. In the Old Testament, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 16:21 states that ‘the laying on of hands’ was the action that the High Priest [[Aaron]] was ordered to do yearly by God to take sins of Israel's nation onto a [[sacrificial lamb|spotless young lamb]].

=== Hinduism ===
&lt;!--Section was previously blanked by an IP: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sin&amp;diff=391608941&amp;oldid=391538998 --&gt;
In [[Hinduism]], the term ''sin'' (''{{IAST|pāpa}}'' in [[Sanskrit]]) is often used to describe actions that create negative [[Karma]] by violating moral and ethical codes, which automatically brings negative consequences. This is somewhat  similar to Abrahamic sin in the sense that pāpa is considered a crime against the laws of God, which is known as (1) [[Dharma]], or moral order, and (2) one's own self, but another term ''aparadha'' is used for grave offences. The term papa cannot be taken however, in literal sense as that of a sin. This is because there is no consensus regarding the nature of ultimate reality or God in Hinduism. Only, the vedanta school being unambiguously theistic, whereas no anthropomorphic God exists in the rest five schools namely Samkhya, Nyaya Yoga, Vaishashikha, and  Purva-Mimansa . The term  ''papa'' however in the strictest sense refers to actions which bring about wrong/unfavourable consequences, not relating to a specific divine will in the absolute sense. To conclude, considering a  lack of consensus  regarding the nature of ultimate reality in Hinduism, it can be considered that ''papa'' has lesser insistence on God for it be translated as Sin, and that there is no exact equivalent to Sin in Hinduism.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islamic views on sin}}

In [[Islamic ethics]], [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the word for sin is the Sanskrit word पाप (''paap''), which is the antithesis of पुण्य (''punya'') meaning merit. A ''[[Jiva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (a being) acquires sin based on its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], if it hurts anyone, causes someone to hurt anyone, or commends hurting anyone by thought, speech or action. Anyone, here, refers to literally any living organism, but not limited to human beings.

No ''jiva'' can achieve ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (ultimate emancipation) without ceasing to accumulate karma and shedding off the already accumulated karma entirely. A ''jiva'' accumulates karma if it resorts to violence, non-chastity, falsehood, stealing, and possessiveness. A ''jiva'' ceases to accumulate karma if he resorts to the golden trio of ''samyak gyan'' (right knowledge), ''samyak darshan'' (right sight) and ''samyak charitra'' (right character). A ''jiva'' begins to shed off the accumulated karma by resorting to penance, repentance, vows and by exterminating foes of lust, anger, attachment, aversion, ignorance and fallacy.

If a ''jiva'' does not give up sin, his karma will keep accumulating and no sin can be absolved without getting its fruit or repenting for it. Thus such a ''jiva'' is bound to remain in the worldly cycle of constant [[reincarnation]], wherein it will keep taking rebirths, into any of the four broad types of living organisms, depending on the magnitude and nature of karma accumulated in previous birth(s). The four types are ''dev'' (beings of heaven, including deities), ''manushya'' (human), ''tiryanch'' (plants, animals, insects, etc.) and ''naarki'' (beings of hell). 

During this cycle of getting born and dying for infinity, the ''jiva'' will have to then live the life of the organism he is and while living it, the ''jiva'' will again perform more karma. This will again lead to rebirth and again performing more karma. Thus, the cycle continues.

It is important to note that Jains believe that for complete liberation, not only the "sinful karma" but even the "meritorious karma" needs to be shed off. This means that a jiva can truly attain moksha, only if the soul is completely and absolutely pure and devoid of any accumulation. For instance, sins may cause the ''jiva'' to be reborn, inter alia, in hell and merits may cause it to be reborn in heaven. But heaven, like hell is a part of worldly cycle of reincarnation and not supreme moksha of the soul. Thus, if a person hypothetically keeps performing only and exclusively good deeds in his life, he may still not attain ''moksha'', because he has not yet shed off previously accumulated sins through repentance and knowledge.

Jains believe that only a human ''jiva'' has the capacity and the will to attain ''moksha''. Hence the ''jiva'' should use this extremely rare opportunity of being born as a human to walk on the path that brings him closer to ''moksha''. In fact, Jains take the concept of avoiding sin so seriously that not only are they completely [[vegetarian]] but some devout Jains also abstain from eating underground grown food like potatoes, onions, etc. to avoid killing small organisms. Most of the Jains are also nonalcoholics and eat before sunset each day.

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish views on sin|Golden mean (philosophy)#Judaism}}
Mainstream [[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Mosaic law]] for [[Jews]], or the seven [[Noahide laws]] for [[Gentiles]] as a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Seven_Noahide_Laws.html|title= The Seven Noachide Laws - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher= Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate= 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism teaches that all humans are inclined to sin from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Rosenberg|first1= A. J.|last2= [[Rashi]]|title= The Book of Genesis (Genesis 8:21 with [[Rashi]]'s commentary)|date= 1969|publisher= The Judaica Press|location= New York|isbn= 1880582082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins with willful intent go without consequence. Unwillful violations of the [[613 commandments|mitzvot]] (without negligence) do not count as sins. "Sins by error" are considered as less severe sins. When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Karbanot|sacrifices]] for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''[[korbanot]]'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''korbanot'' only expiate such "sins by error", that is, sins committed because a person forgot or did not know that this thing was a sin. In some circumstances, lack of knowledge is considered close to deliberate intent. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress, and for the most part, ''korbanot'' cannot atone for a deliberate sin. In addition, ''korbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who suffered harm through the violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html|title= Sacrifices and Offerings (Karbanot)|publisher= Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/answers/jewish-polemics/texts/scriptural-studies/leviticus-1711/|title= Leviticus 17:11|author= Rabbi Michael Skobac|publisher= Jews for Judaism|accessdate= 1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''[[Gehenna|gehinnom]]'', because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.&lt;ref name="rabbimichaelskobac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A Svikiro is an ancestral spirit primarily known to possess a living human  and will give advice based on that communication.&lt;ref name="ogot-1992"/&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] contain many passages outlining approaches to, and descriptions of, [[Violence|violent]] activities, centering on the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient nation of Israel]] and their involvement with [[Gentile]] nations. They also provide civil guidelines on the subject of violent activity as it pertains to individuals within the nation, distinguishing individualistic from [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] actions.

These texts contain [[narrative]]s, [[poetry]], and instruction describing, commanding, or condemning violent actions by God, individuals, groups, and governments.  These actions include war, human and animal sacrifice, murder, rape, stoning, sexism, slavery, criminal punishment, and violent language.&lt;ref name=CreachResources&gt;{{cite book | last = Creach | first = "Jerome F.

Within the [[Pentateuch]] the terms ''gazal'' (rob) and ''asaq'' (oppress) are frequently used in combination to describe the human violence of taking/robbing/plundering as [[oppression]] of the poor which may or may not include physical, verbal or other types of harm.  They are also used both separately and in combination throughout the remainder of the Hebrew Bible describing robbing the poor (Isaiah 3:14, 10:2; Jeremiah 22:3; Micah 2:2, 3:2; Malachi 1:3), withholding the wages of a hired person (cf. Deuteronomy 24:14), political oppression (Hosea 12:7), charging oppressive interest (Ezekiel 22:12), and oppressing the outsider in their midst (Ezekiel 22:7) as acts of violence.&lt;ref name="David J.A.

"The Hebrew ''verb'' ḥāram connotes [complete annihilation] (New Revised Standard Version, “utterly destroy”; Deut. 7:2); the noun that derives from it [[herem (war or property)|ḥērem]]&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt; is sometimes translated as "the ban" and denotes the separation, exclusion and dedication of persons or objects to God which may be set apart for destruction (Deuteronomy 7:26; Leviticus 27:28-29).&lt;ref name="David J.A.

Levine says Exodus 33:5-16 is an example of early Hebrew ideology while noting Deut.7:1-11 contains much the same ideology with the addition of the ban (see also Exodus 20:19,20).

Over half the occurrences of the verb and noun for the root ''ḥ-r-m'' are concerned with the destruction of nations in war, but other terms associated with what Old Testament scholar Eric Siebert describes as "divine violence" may or may not include war. Siebert says divine violence is "violence God is said to have perpetrated, caused, or sanctioned." Specifically, this includes (1) violence God commits without using human agents (e.g., sending down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah); (2) violence God commissions, typically unbeknownst to those being commissioned (e.g., using Babylon to punish Judah for their sins); and (3) violence God commands directly (e.g., ordering [[Israelites]] to wipe out [[Canaanites]])."&lt;ref name="Eric Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seibert|first1=Eric A.|title=Recent Research on Divine Violence in the Old Testament (with Special Attention to Christian Theological Perspectives)|journal=Currents in Biblical Research|date=21 October 2016|volume=15|issue=1|pages=8–40|doi=10.1177/1476993X15600588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, concerning those who worship idols, Deuteronomy 7:16 uses ''akal'' ("consume") when saying "You must ''destroy'' (consume) all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you…".  Deuteronomy 7:24, on the other hand, uses ''abad'' when saying "you shall make their name ''perish'' from under heaven…" while Deuteronomy 20:10-18 says  "…you shall not leave alive anything that breathes.  But you shall utterly destroy (''ha-harem taharimem'') them, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has commanded you…".  "Amos 1:3–2:3 uses akal to indict Israel’s neighbors for various acts of cruelty during war (e.g., the Ammonites “ripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to enlarge their territory”; 1:13) and uses those [[war crime]]s of surrounding peoples to draw a parallel with Israel’s mistreatment of the poor, thus elevating economic injustice to the level of war crimes." (2:6–8).&lt;ref name=CreachResources/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Other terms are: ''ṣamat'' (put an end to, exterminate...annihilate); ''shamad'' (destroy, exterminate); ''nakah'' (to strike fatally, kill, in manslaughter, murder...as retaliation ...in warfare, conquest...combat...attack, rout); ''aqar'' (pluck up, often in the violent sense); ''qatsah'' (to cut off, in a destructive sense); ''shabat'' (with zeker can refer to one's "memory" being "blotted out" but in another idiom it means to "be blotted out...from...[the] earth" to "be exterminated, be destroyed, perish"; and ''kalah'' (kalah in Qal can mean "be finished, be destroyed).&lt;ref name="David J.A.

When [[Fall of man|Adam and Eve disobey God]], he [[curse]]s them and banishes them from the [[Garden of Eden]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3).

In the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (Genesis 6-9), God sees that "wickedness of man was great" and decides to exterminate mankind and all animals, saving only [[Noah]] and those he brought with him on the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]].  After the Flood, God promises to never again destroy all life by a flood.&lt;ref name=CreachTheology/&gt;{{rp|34–41}}&lt;ref name=Siebert&gt;{{cite book|last=Siebert|first=Eric A.| title=The Violence of Scripture: Overcoming the Old Testament's Troubling Legacy| year=2012|publisher =Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis,Minnesota|isbn=978-1-4514-2432-4|page=43,83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Florentino García Martínez"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Martínez| editor1-first=Florentino García| editor2-last=Luttikhuizen| editor2-first=Gerardus Petrus| title=Interpretations of the Flood| year=1998| publisher=Brill| location=Boston| isbn=90-04-11253-7|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pieter Schoubroeck - De verwoesting van Sodom en Gomorra.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Schoubroeck]] - The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, c.1600]]
In Genesis 18-19 God resolves to destroy the cities [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], "because their sin is very grievous". God promises [[Abraham]] that he will spare Sodom if as few as 10 righteous people can be found there. The cities are destroyed, but angels save Abraham's nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and most of his family from the destruction.&lt;ref name="Eric A. Siebert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Siebert|first=Eric A.| title =Disturbing Divine Behavior| year=2009|publisher=Fortress Press| location=Minneapolis,Minnesota|isbn=978-0-8006-6344-5|page=21,22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
God tests Abraham by demanding that he [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice Isaac]], his son (Genesis 22). As Abraham is about to lay the knife upon his son, God restrains him, promising him numberless descendants.&lt;ref name =CreachTheology/&gt;{{rp|42,46}}

Isaac's son [[Jacob]] [[Jacob and Esau|conspires to gain]] his elder brother [[Esau]]'s birthright, but the brothers ultimately reconcile (Genesis 25-33). In Genesis 32:22-32, [[Jacob]] meets and [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestles with someone]], a man, angel or God, who blesses him and gives him the name [[Israel (name)|Israel]].&lt;ref name="Mark Sheridan"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sheridan|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Oden|editor2-first="Thomas C."| title=Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture; Old Testament II, Genesis 12-50| year=2002| publisher=Inter-Varsity Press| location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=0-8308-1472-8|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt by Charles Sprague Pearce.JPG|thumb|right|''Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt'' by [[Charles Sprague Pearce]] (1877)]]
A new [[Pharaohs in the Bible#Pharaohs in the Book of Exodus|pharaoh]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 1) sees that the [[Israelites]] in Egypt have become many and fears they might aid Egypt's enemies. The Egyptians make the Israelites "serve with rigour" and their lives become "bitter with hard service".&lt;ref name="Robert Kugler"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Kugler| author1-first=Robert| author2-last=Hartin| author2-first=Patrick| title=An Introduction to the Bible| year=2009| publisher=Eerdman's Pub.Co.| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan| isbn=978-0-8028-4636-5| page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharaoh orders two Hebrew midwives, [[Shiphrah]] and [[Puah]], to kill the newborn sons of Hebrew women, but they disobey him. Pharaoh then orders his people to drown these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0201.htm|title=Exodus 1 / Hebrew - English Bible / Mechon-Mamre|website=www.mechon-mamre.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses]], a Hebrew [[Finding of Moses|raised by]] [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]], one day encounters an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. He slays the Egyptian and flees Egypt. God hears the plight of the Israelites and sends Moses back to Egypt to bring them out of that land to [[Canaan]]. At one point during the journey back, God intends to kill Moses, but he is [[Zipporah at the inn|saved by his wife Zipporah]] (Exodus 2-4).&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Joseph M.|title=Joseph's Bones:Understanding the Struggle Between God and Mankind in the Bible| year=2007| publisher=Riverhead Books: The Penguin Group| location=New York|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses asks Pharaoh to release the Israelites, but Pharaoh responds by [[Bricks without straw|demanding more work]] from them. Moses repeats his request several times as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] afflict the Egyptians, but God makes Pharaoh refuse until the tenth plague, when God kills all firstborn people and cattle in Egypt, apart from those of the Israelites, who are [[Plagues_of_Egypt#10._Death_of_firstborn_.28.D7.9E.D6.B7.D7.9B.D6.B7.D6.BC.D7.AA_.D7.91.D6.B0.D6.BC.D7.9B.D7.95.D6.B9.D7.A8.D7.95.D6.B9.D7.AA.29:_Ex._11:1.E2.80.9312:36|protected]]. The Israelites are allowed to leave, but God again changes Pharaoh's mind, and an army is sent after them. God saves them from the army by [[Crossing the Red Sea|drowning it in the Red Sea]].&lt;ref name=Gowen&gt;{{cite book| last=Gowen| first=Donald E.| title=Theology in Exodus: Biblical Theology in the Form of a Commentary| year=1994| publisher = Westminster John Knox Press| location=Louisville, Kentucky| isbn=0-664-22057-6| pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], God gives the Israelites the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Covenant Code]] (Exodus 20-23). These laws include [[thou shalt not kill]], [[eye for an eye]] and laws about [[The Bible and slavery|slavery]] and other things. [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|Capital punishment]] is prescribed for some crimes. [[Animal sacrifice]] in the form of [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|burnt offering]]s is mentioned, and it is prescribed that an ox that kills a person is to be stoned. The Code states that "And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." and "Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child." The Israelites promise to follow these laws (Exodus 24:3).&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hayes"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hays | first = Christopher B.| title= Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East| year=2014 | publisher =Westminster John Knox Press| location= Loisville, Kentucky| isbn=978-0-664-23701-1| page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israelites break their promise by worshiping the [[Golden Calf]]. God is angered by this and intends to "consume them", but Moses persuades him not to do so. Moses is also angered, and he breaks two stone tablets with God's writing. On Moses' command, the [[Levites]] kill about three thousand people (Exodus 32).&lt;ref name="Karla R. Suomala"&gt;{{cite book| last = Suomala| first= Karla R.| title= Moses and God in Dialogue: Exodus 32-34 in Postbiblical Literature| year=2004| publisher = Peter Lang Publishing Inc.| location=New York| isbn=0-8204-6905-X|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God has Moses make new stone tablets, and gives Moses the [[Ritual Decalogue]], which states in part "Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their [[Asherah pole|Asherim]]" (Exodus 34).&lt;ref name="William J.

====Book of Deuteronomy====
[[Deuteronomy]] begins with a review of previous stories, including a battle between the Israelites and the Amorites (Deuteronomy 1:41-44), and the destruction of [[Rephaim]] by the Ammonites with Yahweh's help (2:21), along with similar other displacements.&lt;ref name="Peter C.

Similar treatment, at Yahweh's command, was given to the people under Og king of Bashan.&lt;ref name="Peter C. Craigie"/&gt;{{rp|122}}  Moses also recounts how God destroyed the followers of Baal-Peor, and threatens to destroy the Israelites if they return to idolatry. Similar threats of destruction for disobedience, or idolatry more specifically, can be found in Deuteronomy 6, 8, 11. On the other hand, God promises that if his people obey him he will give them victory in fighting their enemies in Deuteronomy 6, 11.&lt;ref name="Peter C. Craigie"/&gt;{{rp|327}}

Deuteronomy 13 insists that those who advocate the worship of other deities must be killed, and that a town that worships other deities must be entirely exterminated, including its livestock. Deuteronomy 14 forbids self-mutilation. Deuteronomy 17 punishes anyone who worships any deity or feature of the natural world with stoning to death, and likewise imposes the death penalty on anyone who disobeys the judicial decision of a priest.&lt;ref name="Bernard M.

Deuteronomy 19 imposes the death penalty for premeditated murder, establishes cities of refuge, and also imposes the ''lex talionis'': "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot" limiting vengeance (verse 21, NRSV).&lt;ref name="Gary Harlan Hall"/&gt;{{rp|297–299}} Deuteronomy 20 regulates warfare, allowing for various exemptions from military service, and mandating that a city which Israel fights (outside of Canaan) should have all of its males slaughtered, with women taken as spoils of war.

It also mandates the stoning to death of rebellious children. Deuteronomy 22 orders the killing of women who cannot prove that they were virgins on their wedding night, and of both the man and woman when a man sleeps with another man's wife. It also mandates the death penalty for a man who has sexual relations with a betrothed virgin, and of the virgin if she does not cry out for help when raped.&lt;ref name="Gary Harlan Hall"/&gt;{{rp|312–344}}

Deuteronomy 24 imposes the death penalty for the kidnapping of a fellow Israelite, and forbids putting parents to death for crimes committed by their children, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Gary Harlan Hall"/&gt;{{rp|367–370}} Deuteronomy 25 allows for judges to have people punished in legal disputes by flogging, but limits the number of strikes to forty.

Deuteronomy 28 contains blessing and curses: blessing, including the defeat of Israel's enemies, if Israel obeys; and curses if Israel disobeys. These curses include disease, famine, defeat and death in warfare, insanity, abuse and robbery, enslavement, and cannibalism due to extreme hunger.

Joshua finishes most of the conquest of Canaan, with the exception of Gibeon and possibly some Canaanites and Amelakites: "For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, that they might have no favour, but that they might be destroyed, as the LORD commanded Moses."

[[David]], anointed king in secret (1 Samuel 16), comes into Saul's service and "loved him greatly".&lt;ref name="Diana Vikander Edelman"/&gt;{{rp|117-125}} The Philistines attack Israel, David slays their champion [[Goliath]], and they flee. David becomes popular, witch makes Saul fear him and plot his death. David and Saul's daughter [[Michal]] wish to marry, and Saul asks for a dowry of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines. David delivers two hundred, and becomes the king's son-in-law (1 Samuel 18). Saul again wishes David dead, but they are reconciled by Saul's son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].

War comes again, David is victorious. Saul again wants to kill David, and he flees with help from his wife. Saul searches for him and slays the inhabitants of the city [[Nob, Israel|Nob]] for aiding David (1 Samuel 22). David defeats the Philistines at [[Keilah]], then flees the city pursued by Saul (1 Samuel 22). David and Saul reconcile. David seeks refuge with [[Achish]], king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], and claims he is raiding Judah but is actually raiding and killing in other places (1 Samuel 27). The Philistines begins a war against Saul. David's wives [[Ahinoam]] and [[Abigail]] are taken in a raid on [[Ziklag]], but he rescue them (1 Samuel 30). The men of Israel flee before the Philistines, and three of Saul's sons are slain. Saul asks his armour-bearer to kill him, but is refused, so he takes his own life. The armour-bearer also takes his own life. Saul's body is beheaded and fastened to a city-wall by the victorious Philistines, but it is retaken by inhabitants of [[Jabesh-Gilead]] (1 Samuel 30).

A man tells David of Saul's death and that he himself killed Saul. David has him killed (2 Samuel 1). A long war starts between David and Saul's son [[Ish-bosheth]] (2 Samuel 3). David demands and is granted the return of his first wife Michal, despite the public grief of her new husband [[Palti, son of Laish|Palti]]. Two men assassinate Ish-bosheth, and David has them killed (2 Samuel 4). David wars victoriously with the Philistines. While transporting the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a man called [[Uzzah]] carelessly touches it and is killed by God (2 Samuel 6).

David defeats and plunder several enemies, and "executed justice and righteousness unto all his people." (2 Samuel 8). [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|The children of Ammon]] mistreat David's emissaries, and is defeated by his army (2 Samuel 10).

In order to make [[Bathsheba]] his wife, David successfully plots the death of [[Uriah the Hittite|her husband]]. This displeases God, and David is told that "the sword shall never depart from thy house." God kills David's and Bathsheba's child, that was conceived during her previous marriage. She then gives birth to [[Solomon]].  David conquers and plunders the city [[Rabbah]] (2 Samuel 11-12).

David's son [[Amnon]] rapes his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]]. [[Absalom]], her full brother, in return has him killed (2 Samuel 13). Absalom conspires and revolts against David. Absalom is finally defeated and dies in the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim]], and David mourns him (2 Samuel 15-19). [[Sheba son of Bichri]] revolts, but is ultimately beheaded (2 Samuel 20).

In 2 Samuel 21, David has seven of Sauls sons and grandsons killed, including "the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul", though he spares Sauls grandson [[Mephibosheth]]. More wars take place. 2 Samuel 23 names and praises several of [[David's Mighty Warriors|David's warriors]].

===Apocalypse===
{{Main|Apocalypticism}}

The [[Book of Revelation]] is full of imagery of war, genocide, and destruction. It describes the [[Apocalypse]], the [[Last Judgment#Christianity|last judgment]] of all the nations and people by God, which includes plagues, war, and economic collapse. Some other books of the Gospels also use apocalyptic language and forms.  Scholars define this as language that "views the future as a time when divine saving and judging activity will deliver God's people out of the present evil order into a new order...This transformation will be cataclysmic and cosmic."&lt;ref name="James Bailey"/&gt;

Whenever Jesus calls people to a new vision in light of God's impending kingdom, judgment, or a future resurrection, he is using apocalyptic speech.&lt;ref name="James Bailey"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Bailey| author1-first=James L.|author2-last="Vander Broek"| author2-first=Lyle D.| title=Literary Forms in the New Testament: A Handbook| year =1992|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press| location=Louiseville, Kentucky|isbn=0-664-25154-4|page=122,123}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jesus uses apocalyptic speech in Matthew 10:15 when he says "it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,"  and in Mark 14:62, where he alludes to the book of Daniel with himself in the future "sitting at the right hand of God." Bailey and Vander Broek go on to say, "In the material about John the Baptizer there also appear apocalyptic images: 'the wrath to come' (Luke 3:7); 'the axe ... lying at the root of the tree' (Luke 3:9);  the Coming One with 'winnowing fork ... in His hand' (Luke 3:17); and chaff burning with 'unquenchable fire' (Luke 3:17)."&lt;ref name="James Bailey"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

Charles B. Strozier, psychoanalyst historian says: "The most troubling dimension of 'endism' is its relation to violence. ... fundamentalists generally believe... transformation can only be accomplished violently, and that the move from our time into the next requires mass death and destruction when '...this earth will be purged in the fires of God's anger, that Jesus will return, and that a new heaven and a new earth will be reborn'".&lt;ref name="Charles B.

==Theological reflections and responses==
Texts of violence have produced a wide variety of theological responses.

===Various views===
As part of the many reflections on [[religious violence]] inspired by the [[Abrahamic religions]] that followed [[9/11]], [[John J. Collins]] wrote a short book called "Does the Bible Justify Violence?".&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Patrick|title=Turn the other page|work=U.S. Catholic;|issue=70(11)|date=Nov 2005|pages=34ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=John J.|title=Does the Bible Justify Violence?|date=2004|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451411287}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}}  In the book he reviews the passages in the Bible describing violence done by God, commanded or promised by God, and done by people, as well as how these texts have been used by religious people and governments throughout history.&lt;ref name=McCormick/&gt;  For example, he discusses [[The Exodus]] and the conquest of the Canaanites in the subsequent [[Book of Joshua]], as two sides of the same coin; the Exodus story has inspired hope for millennia as well as civil rights movements; at the same time people identifying with the liberated Israel supported by God have cited the conquest to justify actions ranging from [[genocide of indigenous peoples]] to [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}  Collins concludes that the Bible speaks in many voices and answers his question as follows: "....historically people have appealed to the Bible precisely because of its presumed divine authority, which gives an aura of certitude to any position it can be shown to support -- in the phrase of Hannah Arendt, 'God-like certainty that stops all discussion.'  And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|32–33}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  "It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|27}}

[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  "The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the "Old Testament," vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the "New Testament," vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).&lt;ref name="Regina Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  "My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity. It would be a Bible embracing multiplicity instead of monotheism."&lt;ref name="Regina Schwartz"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

Stephen Geller notes that both the Deuteronomist and the Priestly authors working in the [[Axial Age]] were re-evaluating and reformulating their traditions, like their neighbors were, using the literary means available to them. The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity—the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.&lt;ref name=geller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0415127718|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their "strange offering" and consumed them with fire.&lt;ref name=geller/&gt;{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: "Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies’ straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews. For the sleeping god may wake someday and take offense, or the waking god may draw us out to where we can never return."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillard|first1=Annie|title=Pilgrim at Tinker Creek|date=1999|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=9780072434170|edition=1st Perennial classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evan Fales, Professor of Philosophy, calls the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]] that some Christians use to understand the crucifixion of Jesus, "psychologically pernicious" and "morally indefensible".  Fales founds his argument on [[John Locke]]’s statement that revelation must conform to our understanding. Philosopher and Professor [[Alvin Plantinga]] says this rests upon seeing God as a kind of specially talented human being.&lt;ref name="Evan Fales"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fales | first = Evan |editor1-last =Bergman |editor1-first = Michael | editor2-last= Murray | editor2-first= Michael J. | editor3-last=Rea | editor3-first=Michael C. | title = Divine evil?

Historian [[Philip Jenkins]] (quoting Phyllis Trible) says the Bible is filled with "texts of terror" but he also asserts these texts are not to be taken literally. Jenkins says eighth century BCE historians added them to embellish their ancestral history and get readers' attention.&lt;ref name="Philip Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book| last = Jenkins | first = Philip | title = Laying Down the Sword; Why We Can't Ignore The Bible's Violent Verses | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2011 | page =8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Testament scholar [[Ellen F. Davis|Ellen Davis]] is concerned by what she calls a "shallow reading" of Scripture, particularly of 'Old Testament' texts concerning violence, which she defines as a "reading of what we think we already know instead of an attempt to dig deeper for new insights and revelations."  She says these difficult texts typically have internal correctives that support an educative reading.&lt;ref name="Ellen Davis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first =  Ellen F. | title = Wondrous Depth: Preaching the Old Testament| publisher = Westminster John Knox Press | location = Louisville, Kentucky | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

===The problem of evil===
Discussions of bible and violence often lead to discussions of the [[theodicy]] - the question of how evil can persist in the world if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and good.&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation/&gt;{{rp|xv-xvi}}

Philosopher [[Eleonore Stump]] says the larger context of God permitting suffering for good purposes in a world where evil is real allows for such events as the killing of those intending evil and God to still be seen as good.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stump| first = Eleonore |editor1-last =Bergman |editor1-first = Michael | editor2-last= Murray | editor2-first= Michael J. | editor3-last=Rea | editor3-first=Michael C. | title = Divine evil?

Jon Levenson resolves the problem of evil by describing God's power not as static, but as unfolding in time: "the operative dichotomy, thus, is not that between limitation and omnipotence, but that which lies between omnipotence as a static attribute and omnipotence as a dramatic enactment: the absolute power of God realizing itself achievement and relationship. What the biblical theology of dramatic omnipotence shares with the theology of a limited God is a frank recognition of God's setbacks, in contrast to the classic theodicies with their exaggerated commitment to divine impassibility and their tendency to describe imperfection solely to human free will, the recalcitrance of matter, or the like."&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation/&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

===Genesis and violence at creation===
[[File:Babylonian religion and mythology (1899) (14595850218).jpg|thumb|The god [[Marduk]] (right) fighting [[Tiamat]]]]
In 1895 [[Hermann Gunkel]] observed that most Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) creation stories contain a [[theogony]] depicting a god doing combat with other gods thus including violence in the founding of their cultures.&lt;ref name="Herman Gunkel 2006"&gt;{{cite book | author1-last= Gunkel | author1-first=Hermann | author2-last=Zimmern | author2-first= Heinrich |translator-last=Whitney Jr. | translator-first= K. William |title = Creation And Chaos in the Primeval Era And the Eschaton: A Religio-historical Study of Genesis 1 and Revelation 12 |publisher = Eerdman's |location=Grand Rapids | year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Babylonian creation epic [[Enuma Elish]], the first step of creation has [[Marduk]] fighting and killing [[Tiamat]], a chaos monster, to establish order.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4–5,16,18}} Kenneth A. Mathews says, "It has been typical of scholarship since Gunkel's ''Schöfung und Chaos'' (1895) to interpret Genesis 1's subjugation of 'the deep' and division of the 'waters' as a remnant of the battle motif between Marduk and watery Tiamat, which was taken up by the Hebrew author and demythologized, [but] most contemporary scholars now see the association of the Hebrew '''tehôm''' ('deep,' 1:2) with Tiamat as superficial."&lt;ref name="Kenneth A. Mathews"&gt;{{cite book| last=Mathews| first ="Kenneth A." | title =The New American Commentary: Genesis 1-11:26 | volume=1A | year=1996 |publisher = Broadman and Holman Publishers | location = Nashville, Tennessee |isbn = 978-0-8054-0101-1 | pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The fact [the Genesis creation account] was likely part of the last stages of the creation of the Pentateuch may indicate that the portrait of God in Gen. 1:1–2:4a was normative for those who gave the Old Testament canon its present shape. Hence, it seems that the account of God creating without violence in Gen. 1:1–2:4a “now serves as the overture to the entire Bible, dramatically relativizing the other cosmologies."&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4}} 

Canaanite creation stories like the ''Enuma Elish'' use very physical terms such as "tore open," "slit," "threw down," "smashed," and "severed" whereas in the Hebrew Bible, Leviathan is not so much defeated as domesticated.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69,70}}  Theologian Christopher Hays says Hebrew stories use a term for dividing (bâdal; separate, make distinct) that is an abstract concept more reminiscent of a Mesopotamian tradition using non-violence at creation. Most modern scholars agree that "Gen. 1:1–2:4a narrates a story of God creating without violence or combat. In [the Genesis] account, the elements do not represent rival deities, and the story declares the creation “good” (Gen. 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is more, in Gen. 1:1–2:4a the elements participate in the process of ordering at God’s invitation (Gen. 1:9, 11, 20).”&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69-72}}  Old Testament scholar [[Walter Brueggemann]] says "God's characteristic action is to "speak"... God "calls the world into being"... "The way of God with his world is the way of language."&lt;ref name="Walter Brueggemann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brueggemann|first1=Walter|title=Genesis: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching|date=2010|publisher=Westminster Jon Know Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|isbn=978-0-664-23437-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stories in Genesis are not the only stories about creation in the Bible. In Proverbs 8, for example one reads of personified ''Wisdom'' being present and participant in creation.&lt;ref name="Christopher B.

However, he also says the differences are more pronounced than the similarities.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69,70}}  Hays says ''Enuma Elish'' and Memphite theology are focused on a certain locale, where Genesis one does not mention a location (Isaiah 66:1); as has been noted, there is no theogeny in Genesis; and in the Canaanite stories the creators are glorified by being identified with other known deities whereas in Genesis, YHWH is glorified by the denial of other deities.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69-72}}

The intent of Genesis 1:1-2n concerning "creation from nothing" is disputed. [[Jon Levenson]], writing Jewish [[biblical theology]], asserts the creation stories in Genesis are not ''[[ex nihilo]]'', but rather a generation of order out of chaos, similar to other ANE creation myths; the order allows life to flourish and holds back chaos which brings violence and destruction, which has never been obliterated and is always breaking back in.  He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible referred to God's actions at creation as a statement of faith in a God who could protect and maintain them, or who could also step back and allow chaos to rush back in, as God did with the Flood.  He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible also held up God's actions at creation as a challenge for God to act, and a challenge for themselves to work in covenant with God in the ongoing work of generating and maintaining order.&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levenson|first1=Jon D.|title=Creation and the persistence of evil : the Jewish drama of divine omnipotence|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9780691029504|edition=Paperback with revisions of the original edition, first published in 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preface (1994)}}  In this, the Bible story is dissimilar to the both the Memphite story and the Babylonian in that the Hebrew Bible says the divine gift of working with God in creation is limited to humankind, meaning, for the Hebrews, humans alone are part of God's being.

Warfare represents a special category of biblical violence and is a topic the Bible addresses, directly and indirectly, in four ways: there are verses that support [[pacifism]], and verses that support [[non-resistance]]; 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] found the basis of [[just war]] in the Bible, and [[preventive war]] which is sometimes called [[crusade]] has also been supported using Bible texts.&lt;ref name="Robert G.

===The Book of Judges and violence against women===

[[File:Cathedral Basilica of Saint Clement, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico04.jpg|thumb|Deborah the Judge, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico]]

Violence against women appears throughout the Old Testament. Many have attributed this to a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, while some scholars say the problem stems from the larger context of a male dominated culture. Women are treated in differing ways in the Bible. For example, the Book of Judges includes the judge [[Deborah]], who was honored, as well as two of the most egregious examples in the Bible of violence against women: [[Jephthah]]’s daughter (Judg. 11:29–40) and the Levite’s concubine (Judg. 19).&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="Carol Meyers"&gt;{{cite book | last =Meyers | first = Carol | title =Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context | publisher =Oxford University Press | location = New York |year= 1988 | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar author [[Phyllis Trible]] looks at these instances from the perspective of the victim making their [[pathos]] palpable, underlying their human reality, and the tragedy of their stories.&lt;ref name="Phyllis Trible"&gt;{{cite book| last=Trible | first=Phyllis| title=Texts of Terror:Literary-Feminist readings of Biblical Narratives | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist critiques of Judges say the Bible gives tacit approval to violence against women by not speaking out against these acts.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|14}}

O'Connor says women in the Old Testament generally serve as points of reference for the larger story, yet Judges abounds with stories where women play the main role.  O'Connor explains the significance of this, saying: "The period between the death of Joshua and the anointing of Saul...was a period of uncertainty and danger... lack of human leadership is viewed as disastrous, for when "every one does what is right in their own eyes, the results are awful" and that is illustrated by the violent acts against women recorded in Judges.&lt;ref name="OConnor1986"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/58724/HAR_v10_277.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Women in the Book of Judges|last=O'Connor|first=M.|year=1986|journal=Hebrew Annual Review|volume=10|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=fac_dis|year=1992|last=Hartman|first=Harvey D.|title=The Feminine Gender as a Literary Device in the Narrative of Judges}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|277,278}}

Beginning with the larger context and tracing the decline of Israel by following the deteriorating status of women and the violence done to them, which progresses from the promise of life in the land to chaos and violence, the effects of the absence of authority such as a king (Judges 21:25) is reflected in the violence against women that occurs when government fails and social upheaval occurs.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Mariam M.

===The violence of Hell===
{{main|Problem of Hell}}
The ancient Israelites did not worship the dead, sacrifice to them, or hope to reunite with them in an afterlife; a concept of hell as a place of punishment in the afterlife arose in [[Second Temple Judaism]] and was further developed in the Christian tradition; Judaism subsequently moved away from this notion.&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Alice K.|title=The History of Hell|year=1993|publisher=Harcourt Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-15-600137-3| page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Hebrew Bible verses indicating early Jewish thought did contain some belief in an afterlife. For example Isaiah 26:14 which is part of Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1–39), containing the words of Isaiah who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th century BCE speaks of "the dead who live no more" as being "punished and destroyed". And Daniel 12:2,3 which is generally believed to date to the second century BCE asserts, "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt." More evidence comes from Maccabees, written in the second century BCE, and by the first century CE, friction between the Sadducees and the Pharisees over this issue is documented by both the New Testament writers and Josephus giving evidence of its presence in Jewish thought.&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

The word Sheol appears 65 times in the Hebrew Bible and the term "Tartaros" appears frequently in Jewish apocalyptic literature where it refers to a place where the wicked are punished.&lt;ref name = "John F. Walvoord"/&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="William Crockett"/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"/&gt;  In the New Testament there are three words translated ''Hell'': the Greek word ''hades,'' which is a general equivalent of the Hebrew ''Sheol,'' is used to identify the temporary place of the unsaved after death but is not used in relationship to the lake of fire or eternal punishment;  ''gehenna'' is uniformly translated Hell and refers to eternal punishment; and one occurrence of ''tartaros'' appears in 2 Peter 2:4 and is considered equivalent to ''gehenna''.  All the references to ''gehenna'' (except James 3:6) are spoken by Jesus himself.  A literal interpretation involves violence.&lt;ref name="John F. Walvoord"&gt;{{cite book | last = Walvoord | first = John F. |editor1-last =Crockett |editor1-first = William | editor2-last= Gundry | editor2-first= Stanley N. | title = Four Views on Hell | year = 1996 | publisher=Zondervan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| pages=11–28| chapter = chapter 1: The Literal View}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William Crockett chapter"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crockett | first = William |editor1-last =Crockett |editor1-first = William | editor2-last= Gundry | editor2-first= Stanley N. | title = Four Views on Hell | year = 1996 | publisher=Zondervan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| pages=37–39, 43–91 | chapter = chapter 2: The Metaphorical View}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus also taught punishment in Hell would be by degrees (an idea Dante later developed) with one servant receiving a lighter beating than others, hypocrites receiving more condemnation than others, and so on.&lt;ref name = "John F. Walvoord"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

According to a statement by the publisher of "Four Views on Hell", [[Zondervan]], "probably the most disturbing concept in Christian tradition is the prospect that one day vast numbers of people will be consigned to Hell."&lt;ref name = "William Crockett"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Crockett| editor1-first=William| editor2-last=Gundry| editor2-first= Stanley N.| title=Four views on Hell| year=1996| publisher = Zondervan| location =Grand Rapids, Michigan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C.S.Lewis argued that people choose Hell rather than repent and submit to God. Miroslav Wolf argues that the doctrine of final judgment provides a necessary restraint on human violence. Tim Keller says it is right to be angry when someone brings injustice or violence to those we love and therefore a loving God can be filled with wrath because of love, not in spite of it. Oliver O'Donovan argues that without the judgment of God we would never see the love in redemption.&lt;ref name="Stanley N.

===Marcionism and supersessionism===

As the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|early Christian Church began to distinguish itself from Judaism]], the "Old Testament" and a portrayal of God in it as violent and unforgiving were sometimes contrasted rhetorically with certain teachings of Jesus to portray an [[image of God]] as more loving and forgiving, which was framed as a new image.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;

[[Marcion of Sinope]], in the early second century, developed an [[Marcionism|early Christian dualist belief system]] that understood the [[Yahweh|god of the Old Testament]] and [[Creator deity|creator]] of the material universe, who he called the [[Demiurge]], as an altogether different being than the God about whom Jesus spoke. Marcion considered Jesus' universal [[God]] of compassion and love, who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy, incompatible with Old Testament depictions of divinely ordained violence. Accordingly, he did not regard the Hebrew scriptures as part of [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|his scriptural canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce. ''Canon of the NT'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-826180-3}}; The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1913 characterized Marcion as "perhaps the most dangerous foe Christianity has ever known."; [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html Harnack's Origin of the New Testament]: "Marcion, on the contrary, treats the Catholic Church as one that “follows the Testament of the Creator-God,” and directs the full force of his attack against this Testament and against the falsification of the Gospel and of the Pauline Epistles by the original Apostles and the writers of the Gospels. He would necessarily have dealt with the two Testaments of the Catholic Church if the Church had already possessed a New Testament. His polemic would necessarily have been much less simple if he had been opposed to a Church which, by possessing a New Testament side by side with the Old Testament, had ipso facto placed the latter under the shelter of the former. In fact Marcion’s position towards the Catholic Church is intelligible, in the full force of its simplicity, only under the supposition that the Church had not yet in her hand any “litera scripta Novi Testamenti.”"&lt;/ref&gt; Marcion's teaching was repudiated by [[Tertullian]] in five treatises titled "[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_III/Anti-Marcion/The_Five_Books_Against_Marcion Against Marcion]" and Marcion was ultimately excommunicated by the [[Christian Church|Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jeremiah |first=Jorge V. |last=Pixley |author-link=George V.

For example, a recent edition of Religious Studies News, an Internet journal of the Society of Biblical Literature, advertises itself as a feature on violence in the Bible, yet articles focus with virtual singularity on Hebrew Bible texts and Hebrew Bible atrocities.... But by raising questions only about Hebrew texts, this issue performs a sort of violence of its own—the "real" problem lies in the "Jewish" texts, not in the Christian Testament....More troubling than studies of violence in the Bible that ignore the New Testament are those that lift up the New Testament as somehow containing the antidote for Old Testament violence.

That is the center of Christian faith. All the rest turns on this. A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement.... In the early nineteenth century, some progressive Christian theologians carried the idea of supersessionism to a new level. According to them, the God of Jesus Christ was not revealed by the Hebrew Bible at all, and therefore had never entered into a special relationship with the Jewish people in the first place.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological reflections and responses==

Jože Krašovec described the [[ancient near east]]ern (ANE) context in which the stories and text of the Hebrew Bible originated, in which gods were identified with peoples, and the flourishing or destruction of a people were a reflection of the power of its god or gods; while the ancient Israelites conceived of its deity as one person in contrast to the polytheistic conception of its neighbors, it remained like other ANE peoples in considering itself as a whole in relationship with its god.  From this foundation arose notions of flourishing of the nation as a whole, as well as [[collective punishment]] of the ancient Israelites and their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krašovec|first1=Jože|title=Reward, punishment, and forgiveness : the thinking and beliefs of ancient Israel in the light of Greek and modern views|date=1999|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden [u.a.]|isbn=9004114432|oclc=42475527|chapter=Chapter XII: Holy War as Punishment and protection }} He cites the following examples of collective punishment (of descendants) in the Bible:
::Ex 20:5 - "You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments."
::Deut 5:9-10
::Exodus 34:6-7:  "And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation."
::Deuteronomy 7:9-10 - "Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands. 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;       he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him."
::Jeremiah 32:18  - " You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty"
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Nur Masalha]] writes that the "genocide" of the extermination commandments has been "kept before subsequent generations" and served as inspirational examples of divine support for slaughtering enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, Nur, ''The Bible and Zionism: invented traditions, archaeology and post-colonialism in Palestine-Israel, Volume 1'', Zed Books, 2007, pp 273-276:
:"[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior]] revisits the old ground [in his book ''The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique''] … First, the biblical narrative, with its 'divine promise' was inherently linked with the mandate to ethnically cleanse or exterminate the indigenous people … third, in the narrative of the Book of Deuteronomy the divine command to commit 'genocide' is explicit.  Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua.  These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers…. The historical evidence, however, strongly suggests that such [[genocidal massacre]]s never actually took place, although these racist, xenophobic and militaristic narratives remained for later generations as powerful examples of divine aid in battle and of a divine command for widespread slaughter of an enemy…. [Professor Bernardo Gandulla, of the University of Buenos Aires], while sharing Prior's critique of the perverse use that Zionism and the State of Israel have made of the Bible to support their 'ethnic cleansing' policies in Palestine, …  Prior … found incitement to war and violence in the very foundation documents of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic.  Furthermore, in their conquest of Canaan, the Israelites are commanded by Yahweh to destroy the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine.  Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies…. Today, both Christian Zionists in the West and Israeli messianics continue to refer to the Hebrew Scriptures for archetypal conflicts, which guide their attitudes towards the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine: the Palestinian Muslims and Christians."  Masalha refers to: [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior, Michael P.]], ''The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique'', Sheffield Academic Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Grenke quotes historian, author and scholar [[David Stannard]]: "Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament. He points to sections in Deuteronomy in which the Israelite God, Yahweh, commanded that the Israelites utterly destroy idolaters whose land they sought to reserve for the worship of their deity (Deut 7:2, 16, and 20:16–17). ... According to Stannard, this view of war contributed to the ... destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas. It was this view that also led to the destruction of European Jewry. Accordingly, it is important to look at this particular segment of the Old Testament: it not only describes a situation where a group undertakes to totally destroy other groups, but it also had a major influence on shaping thought and belief systems that permitted, and even inspired, genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Grenke, Arthur, ''God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries'', New Academia Publishing, LLC, 2005, pp 17–18: "Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament.

Sociologists Frank Robert Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn question "the applicability of the term [genocide] to earlier periods of history, and the judgmental and moral loadings that have become associated with it."&lt;ref name="Frank Robert Chalk"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Chalk| author1-first="Frank Robert"| author2-last=Jonassohn| author2-first=Kurt| title=The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies| year=1990| publisher = Yale University Press| location=New Haven, Connecticut| isbn=0-300-04445-3| pages=3, 23–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most societies of the past endured and practiced genocide, it was accepted as "being in the nature of life" because of the "coarseness and brutality" of life.&lt;ref name="Frank Robert Chalk"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Chalk and Jonassohn say the Old Testament contains cases they would consider genocide (if they were factual) because of women and children being killed even though it was war and casualties in war are excluded from the definition of genocide.

Arie Versluis says, "...indigenous populations have also appealed to the command (in Deut.7) in order to expel their colonizers.

Scholar Leonard B. Glick states that [[Jewish fundamentalism|Jewish fundamentalists]] in Israel, such as [[Shlomo Aviner]], consider the [[Palestinians]] to be like biblical Canaanites, and that some fundamentalist leaders suggest that they "must be prepared to destroy" the Palestinians if the Palestinians do not leave the land.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Leonard B., "Religion and Genocide", in ''The Widening circle of genocide'',   Alan L. Berger (Ed). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p 46::"[God] looked with favor on what we may fairly call their [Israelite] proto-genocidal destructiveness.  The Book of Joshua provides us with one of the earliest texts in which a deity quite plainly promotes the destruction of a people.  As the Hebrews, under Joshua's leadership, undertake the conquest of Canaan, they massacre everyone who stands in their way…. It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God.  Here, for example, is [[Shlomo Aviner]], a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim … movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites.  There is only one catch.  The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.  Others have identified the Palestinians as 'Canaanites' who are engaged in a 'suicidal' struggle opposing God's own intentions;  hence the Jewish people must be prepared to destroy them if they persist in pursuing their collective 'death-wish'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars draw similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelam, Keith W., ''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history'', Routledge, 1996, especially pp 71–121.  Cited by Ehrlich,  pp 117 "Keith Whitelam (1996) has published a book [''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history''] in which he has implied that the modern European imperialist Zionist Jewish movement has drawn inspiration from the biblical conquest tradition … Parallels are thus drawn in Whitelam's thought between the genocidal Israelites presumably of Joshua's day and the racist Zionists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and also between the ancient Canaanites and the modern Palestinians … the interpretations attributed to [Whitelam] of the place of the book of Joshua and its … genocidal account of Israel's emergence in the land that it claims as its own pose a challenge to Judaism…. It thus behooves us to ask … how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?…."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boustan, Ra'anan S., ''Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity'', BRILL, 2010, page 4-5
:"Later readers of the Bible dramatically transformed this divine directive [Deut 20:15-18] through hermeneutic alignment of the Canaanites with the current detested 'other'.  Thus the Canaanites have been identified with … Palestinians (by militant Zionists), and scores of other 'enemies' of Israel.  In doing so, the violence perpetrated against these groups is not only justified, but indeed, part and parcel of the original divine plan.  The violent legacy of the Bible is a product of both its own violent narrative and the hermeneutics of violence applied to it".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Girard]], historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science says that, "desire is mimetic (i.e. all of our desires are borrowed from other people), that all conflict originates in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), that the scapegoat mechanism is the origin of sacrifice and the foundation of human culture, and religion was necessary in human evolution to control the violence that can come from mimetic rivalry, and that the Bible reveals these ideas and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.".&lt;ref name="René Girard"&gt;{{cite book | last=Girard | first=René | title=The Scapegoat | year=1986 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | location=Baltimore | isbn=0-8018-3315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher, sociologist, theologian and author [[Jacques Ellul]] says: "I believe that the biblical teaching is clear. It always contests political power. It incites to "counterpower," to "positive" criticism, to an irreducible dialogue (like that between king and prophet in Israel), to antistatism, to a decentralizing of the relation, to an extreme relativizing of everything political, to an anti-ideology, to a questioning of all that claims either power or dominion (in other words, of all things political)...Throughout the Old Testament we see God choosing what is weak and humble to represent him (the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, etc.). Paul tells us that God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty..."

'''The Matheson Trust''' is an educational charity based in London dedicated to further and disseminate the study of [[comparative religion]], especially from the point of view of the [[Perennial philosophy#Definition|underlying harmony]] of the major religious and philosophical traditions of the world. 

== History ==

The Matheson Trust was established in London in 1974 by [[Donald Macleod Matheson]] [[CBE]] (1896-1979),&lt;ref&gt;Settlement recorded in the archives of the London Borough of [[Bromley]], 12 January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition to his work as a civil servant&lt;ref&gt;Matheson was appointed CBE in 1945, after serving for years as the Secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]: [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37119/supplements/2953/page.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; was active as a translator of [[Traditionalist School|Perennialist]] works, most notably ''Understanding Islam'' by [[Frithjof Schuon]]&lt;ref&gt;George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''An Introduction to Sufi Doctrine'' by [[Titus Burckhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Donald-McLeod-Matheson.aspx |title=Sh.

In March 2011 the Matheson Trust website was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/announce/2011/03/04/matheson-website-launched/ |title=Matheson Website Launched — The Matheson Trust |publisher=Themathesontrust.org |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting an online library of free selected books and articles, almost exclusively in English, including authors and sources as varied as [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah|Shaykh Abdallah Bin Bayyah]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/ |title=archbishopofcanterbury.org |publisher=archbishopofcanterbury.org |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]] archives, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Jonathan Sacks|Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks]], [[James Cutsinger]], [[Gavin D'Costa]], [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], [[Harry Oldmeadow]], the journal [[Ali Lakhani|Sacred Web]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Timothy Winter]] (Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad), [[The Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths]] and others. Documents are free to browse and download, most in [[PDF]] format, with a few articles in HTML.&lt;br /&gt;

As of October 2018, there are more than 600 holdings in the library, a quarter of which are audio recordings.

=== Audio Library ===

One of the purported aims of the Matheson Library is to use existing contemporary media technologies to make available resources from ancient traditions, either in the form of recitation of traditional scriptures or in the scholarly transmission of the doctrines and insights pertaining to the different religions. An ongoing ''hear!'' project is converting scholarly texts and other texts of interest into [[MP3]] format, and making them available through the Audio section of the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themathesontrust.org/type/audio/ |title=Audio |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the ''Matheson Trust Sacred Audio Collection'' was launched, a repository of selected liturgical audio recordings from the major religious traditions. This collection includes live recordings from temples and ritual gatherings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/sacred-audio-collection |title=Sacred Audio Collection |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five fables of ancient Greek origin that deal with '''the statue of Hermes'''. All have been classed as burlesques&lt;ref&gt;Henk Versnel, ''Coping with the gods: wayward readings in Greek theology'', Brill 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSANEJjPHAIC&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;ots=tbYPDiS98c&amp;dq=Hermes%20%20%22fable%22%20%20%20statue&amp;pg=PA329#v=onepage&amp;q=Hermes%20%20%22fable%22%20%20%20statue&amp;f=false pp.329-30]&lt;/ref&gt; that show disrespect to the god involved and some scepticism concerning the efficacy of religious statues as objects of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wojciechowsky, “Ancient criticism of religion”, in ''Deuterocanonical Additions of the Old Testament Books: Selected Studies'', Walter de Gruyter 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5Ar-KSEfh4C&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=statue%20fable%20Hermes&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=statue%20fable%20Hermes&amp;f=false p.68]&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of Hermes differed according to function and several are referenced in these stories. Only one fable became generally retold in later times, although two others also achieved some currency.

==1 Hermes and the sculptor==
The fable appears as number 88 in the [[Perry Index]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/88.htm Aesopica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was to become a favourite in Europe from the [[Renaissance]] on. It is directed against self-conceit in general and concerns a visit to a statue maker made in human disguise by the god [[Hermes]]. Finding that [[Jove]], the king of the gods, was set at a low price and his queen at only a little more, he felt sure that, since he was their messenger, his own statue must command much more. When he asked about it, however, the sculptor told him that if he would buy the other two statues he could have that one free.

A [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] poem on the theme appeared in [[Gabriele Faerno]]'s ''Centum Fabulae'' (1563) with the moral that 'Many who fancy themselves are set at nothing'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wlATAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=Mercurius&amp;f=false ''Mercurius et statuarius'', p.79]&lt;/ref&gt; In England prose versions appeared in the collections of [[Roger L'Estrange]] (1692)&lt;ref&gt;"Mercury and the Statuary", [http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/169.htm fable 169]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samuel Croxall]] (1722).&lt;ref&gt;"Mercury and the carver" [https://books.google.com/books?id=vjYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22samuel%20croxall%22%20fables&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury&amp;f=false fable 156]&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these, the name of the Greek god is changed to [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], his Latin equivalent. There were also two English verse retellings. In Edward Arwaker's ''Truth in Fiction'' (1708), the story is subtitled "Vain-glory mortified" and is a much more circumstantial account. Statues of the gods are described as currently ‘a drug on the market’ to explain the low price asked and, in addition, the statue of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] is cheaper since she is a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Book 4, Fable 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YWRFAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;ots=IwEHLuKk8V&amp;dq=mercury%20and%20the%20statue%20%20fable&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury%20and%20the%20statue%20%20fable&amp;f=false p.289]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Jefferys Taylor wrote a sprightly version for children in which the sculptor assures Mercury that his statue merely serves as a make-weight when a set of the gods is bought.&lt;ref&gt;''Aesop in Rhyme'', [https://archive.org/stream/aesopinrhymewith00tayliala#page/30/mode/2up/search/Mercury pp.30-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrations of the tale, starting from the miniature in the Greek Medici Manuscript of about 1470, invariably feature the god pointing out his statue to the sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=mercurius%20et%20statuarius Laura Gibbs Flickr site]&lt;/ref&gt;  An English copper engraving by [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] for the specially commissioned ''Seven Fables of Aesop'' (1928) shows an up-to-date sculptor at work on the statue.&lt;ref&gt;"Hermes and the sculptor", the fourth print at the [http://www.artwales.com/artists-detail-print-mtg-en.php?artistID=27 Martin Tinney Gallery site]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian linocut by John Ryrie is more sly in its updating. The god wears a collar, tie and smart overcoat as he enters into negotiation with the aproned workman. It is only the detail of sandals on his feet and the wings fluttering from beneath the trousers at his ankles that give his identity away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrysalis.com.au/TXfbS/Artwork-Ryrie-MercuryandtheSculptor-666.htm Chrysalis Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2 Hermes and the dog==
The fable is numbered 308 in the Perry Index and is a broad piece of Greek [[Scatology#Literature|scatalogical]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/308.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a poetical version in the Greek of [[Babrius]], but thereafter written accounts do not seem to continue. The Victorian translator of his work, Rev. John Davies, omitted it from his ''Fables of Babrius'' (1860),&lt;ref&gt;Fable 48, [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Babrius/Part1-Fables40-79.html Elfinspell transcription]&lt;/ref&gt; although the story is harmless enough. A dog of a pious turn of mind salutes the god's four-sided [[herma]], a statue of the kind used to mark boundaries and stages along a road. When the animal announces its intention to anoint him, the god hastily begs it not to and says he does not need to be honoured any further.

==3 The sculptor’s dream==
The story is numbered 307 in the Perry Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/307.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are poetical versions in the Greek of Babrius&lt;ref&gt;Rev. John Davies, ''Fables of Babrius'', [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Babrius/Part1-Fables1-39.html#fable30 fable 30]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin of [[Avianus]], although the latter account is told of [[Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Pedlar and the Merchant", [https://archive.org/stream/fablesofavianusn00ohai#page/n49/mode/2up Fable 23]&lt;/ref&gt; The type of statue involved in this case would be of the god as a handsome young man. Two customers approach the statuary, one wishing to place his work in the tomb of his son, one proposing to use it for private worship. Deciding to sleep on the matter, he is visited by Hermes in a dream and is told that he has in his hands the decision to make him either a dead man or a divinity. Although the fable is light-hearted, the 2nd century physician and philosopher, [[Galen]], gave it a more serious turn by applying the story to human potentiality. In a work on ethics, he tells the fable and then continues by commenting that similarly “You have a choice between honouring your soul by making it like the gods and treating it contemptuously by making it like the brute beasts”.&lt;ref&gt;The work only exists now in an Arabic translation, [http://purplemotes.net/2012/12/05/galen-godly-man-hermes-herm Purple Motes site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==4 The wish-fulfilling image==
[[File:Winterpalais Hermes Statue.jpg|thumb|An 18th century Viennese statue of Hermes the wealth-bringer]]
The fable numbered 99 in the Perry Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/99.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; was not translated into English until it appeared in the substantial collection of [[Roger L'Estrange]] under the title “An image expos’d to sale”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472402/lestrange44 Fable 446]&lt;/ref&gt;
A sculptor hawks his newly finished statue at market by declaring that this is a wonder-working god and will profit its owner. When asked why he is selling such a valuable asset, the huckster replies that he is in need of immediate funds while Hermes takes his time in granting favours. Later English versions include "The Seller of Images" in George Fyler Townsend's ''Aesop's Fables'' (1867)&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/townsend/207.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; and V.S. Vernon-Jones' new translation as "The Image Seller" in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/vernonjones/109.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==5 The statue and the treasure== 
The story is numbered 285 in the Perry Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/285.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; and was versified in Greek by Babrius, drawing the moral that evil men will only comply when insulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Babrius/Part1-Fables80-129.html#fable117 Fable 119]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the wealth-bringing Hermes does not deliver the expected benefits and his frustrated worshipper smashes the image on the floor. When a flood of gold coins pours from the head, the man reproaches the kind of personality that will not render good for good but does so when ill-treated. While Babrius specifically named the god involved, [[Hieronymus Osius]] did not when he versified the fable in Latin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/osius/203.htm Fable 203]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Pantaleon Candidus]] specifically states that he does not know in his Latin poem,''Homo et statua''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camena/del2/deliciae2.html#delb0056 Fable 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Neither did [[William Caxton]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/66.htm Book 6.6]&lt;/ref&gt; and Roger L'Estrange&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/105.htm Fable 105]&lt;/ref&gt; say who it is in their English prose versions, which end with reflections on misdirected worship. [[La Fontaine's Fables|Jean de la Fontaine]] is equally reticent about the god's identity in his ''L’homme et son idole de bois'' (The man and his wooden idol, ''Fables'' IV.8).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net/fourassman.htm English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been surmised that one explanation for the scepticism of these last two fables was that Hermes was the god of trade and merchants and the Greeks had a certain ambivalence towards wealth making.&lt;ref&gt; Christos A. Zafiropoulos, ''Ethics in Aesop's Fables: The Augustana Collection'', Brill 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-blOQAp553IC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;ots=OvLpgE9Wbl&amp;dq=augustana%20collection%20%20%22Hermes%22&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=augustana%20collection%20%20%22Hermes%22&amp;f=false p.111]&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th century Byzantine Greek lexicon known as the [[Suda]] explains what form of statue is involved here. "They say Hermes was responsible for profit and an overseer of the businesses: consequently they set up the statue of him weighing a purse."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Trade Theoi.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is to such sculptures that the statue on the  stairs of  the [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene]] in Vienna can be referred, although it is itself ambiguous. The sculptor rests with chisel in hand on the statue's right as it looks down towards another similarly dressed individual on the other side who raises his hand towards the god. It might therefore remind viewers of the first of the fables here, which was well known. But it is the purse held well away in the god's right hand which seems to be drawing the gaze of the man below, whose hand is cupped as if in supplication. The statue can therefore be read alternatively as referencing either of the last two fables here.

The relationship between '''[[transgender]] people and [[religion]]''' varies widely around the world. Religions range from condemning any [[gender variance]] to honoring transgender people as religious leaders. Views within a single religion can vary considerably.

==Abrahamic religions==
[[Abrahamic religions]] have creation stories in which [[God]] creates people, "male and female".&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{bibleref|Genesis|1:27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|75|39|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is sometimes interpreted as a divine mandate against gender variance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  The [[Torah]] contains specific prohibitions on cross-dressing&lt;ref name="Deuteronomy"&gt;{{bibleref|Deuteronomy|22:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and damaged genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Deuteronomy|23:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The term ''saris'', generally translated to English as "[[eunuch]]" or "[[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]]",&lt;ref name="Strong's"&gt;Strong's Concordance, #5631&lt;/ref&gt; appears 45 times in the Tanakh. It frequently refers to a trusted but gender variant person who was delegated authority by a powerful person.&lt;ref name="bibleeunuchs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/bibleeunuchs.htm|title=The forty-five occurrences of ''saris'' in the Old Testament |work=Born Eunuchs Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether most were in fact castrated.&lt;ref name="bibleeunuchs"/&gt;  In Isaiah 56 God promises eunuchs who keep the Sabbath and hold fast to his covenant that he will build an especially good monument in heaven for them, to make up for their childlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Isaiah|56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tumtum (Judaism)|Tumtum]] (טומטום in Hebrew, meaning "hidden") is a term that appears in Jewish Rabbinic literature and usually refers to a person whose sex is unknown, because their genitalia are covered or "hidden". A tumtum is not defined as a separate gender, but rather a state of doubt.

[[Androgynos]] (אנדרוגינוס in Hebrew, translation "intersex") refers to someone who possesses both male and female sexual characteristics. The nature of the individual's gender is ambiguous.

====Orthodox Judaism====
[[Orthodox Judaism]] asserts that sex/gender is an innate and eternal category based on verses in the [[Book of Genesis]] about [[Adam and Eve]] and the creation of maleness and femaleness.&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt; Sex-change operations involving the removal of genital organs are forbidden on the basis of the prohibition against “anything which is mauled, crushed, torn or cut” (Lev. 22:24). A further prohibition in Deut. 22:5, proscribes not only cross-dressing but any action uniquely identified with the opposite sex, and this would also apply to an operation to transform sexual characteristics.&lt;ref name=apple&gt;{{cite web|last=Apple|first=Raymond|title=Transsexuality - Ask the Rabbi|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/07/transsexuality-ask-the-rabbi/|work=OzTorah|accessdate=16 June 2014}} See also {{cite book|last1=Bleich|first1=J.

[[Conservative Judaism]] has mixed views on transgender people.

In contrast, a 2000 document from the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] concludes that the sex-change procedures do not change a person's gender in the eyes of the Church.

"What is often expressed and understood by the term 'gender,' is definitively resolved in the self-emancipation of the human being from creation and the Creator", he warned. "Man wants to create himself, and to decide always and exclusively on his own about what concerns him."  The Pontiff said this is humanity living "against truth, against the creating Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-24652?l=english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224112659/http://www.zenit.org/article-24652?l=english |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-24 |title=Pontiff Calls for "Ecology of Man" &amp;#124; ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome |publisher=ZENIT |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2015-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in 2015, the Vatican declared that transgender Catholics cannot become godparents, stating in response to a transgender man's query that transgender status "reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality" and that, "[t]herefore it is evident that this person does not possess the requirement of leading a life according to the faith and in the position of godfather and is therefore unable to be admitted to the position of godfather or godmother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wofford |first=Taylor |title=Transgender Catholics Can't Be Godparents, Vatican Says|url=http://www.newsweek.com/vatican-transgender-godparents-368142|publisher=Newsweek.com|date=September 2, 2015|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics, nevertheless, have held a range of positions regarding transgender issues.

The treatment of ''mukhannathun'' varied throughout early Islamic history, and the meaning of the term took on new dimensions over time. In some eras, men deemed ''mukhannathun'' were persecuted and castrated, while in others they were celebrated as musicians and entertainers.&lt;ref name="TEOEM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Music of the Arabs|last1=Touma|first1=Habib|year=1975|page=135-136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the term came to be associated with the receptive partner in [[gay sexual practices]], as homosexuality was seen as an extension of effeminacy. In the late medieval era, several Islamic scholars held that ''mukhannathun'' who had innate feminine mannerisms were not blameworthy as long as they did not violate religious laws concerning sexual morality.&lt;ref name="TEOEM" /&gt;

Due to [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] issuing a [[fatwa]] allowing [[sex reassignment surgery]] for intersex and transgender individuals,&lt;ref name="Alipour" /&gt; Iran carries out more sex change operations than any other nation in the world except for [[Thailand]]. It is sanctioned as a supposed "cure" for homosexuality, which is punishable by death under Iranian law. The government even provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance and a sex change is recognised on the birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7259057.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Iran's 'diagnosed transsexuals' |first=Vanessa |last=Barford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baha'i Faith===
In the [[Baha'i Faith]], transgender people can gain recognition in their gender if they have medically transitioned under the direction of medical professionals, and if they have [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS).

{{Main|Hinduism and LGBT topics}}

[[Hindu]] philosophy has the concept of a [[Third gender|third sex]] or [[third gender]] (''tritiya-prakriti'' – literally, "third nature"). The people in this category of sex/gender are called Hijras in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neither Man Nor Woman: The Hijras of India|last=Nanda|first=Serena|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=978-0534509033|location=|page=137|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as homosexuals, transsexuals, bisexuals, the intersexed, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pattanaik |first=Devdutt |title=The Man Who Was a Woman and Other Queer Tales from Hindu Lore |page=10 |location=Binghamton, NY |publisher=Harrington Park Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1560231806}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such persons were not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others=Translated by George Bühler |title=The Laws of Manu |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu.htm |chapter=Chapter 3:49 |chapterurl=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu/manu03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. Hijras identify themselves as incomplete men, that they do not have the desires (for women) that other men do. This lack of desire they attribute to  a "defective organ." If a Hijra is not born with a "defective" organ (and most are not), he must make it so by emasculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neither Man Nor Woman: The Hijras of India|last=Nanda|first=Serena|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=978-0534509033|location=|page=143|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often kept their own societies or town quarters, performed specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and were generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. However, these beliefs are not upheld in all divisions of Hinduism. In Hinduism, the universal creation is honored as unlimitedly diverse and the recognition of a third sex is simply one more aspect of this understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Amara Das |year=2003 |title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex |page=110 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Xlibris |isbn=978-1-4535-0317-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people in ancient Hindu society ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

Within the Hindu context, Hijras have always been considered a part of the third gender diaspora, and hence the term Hijra, Transgender, Third gender will be used interchangeably.

Due to their classification as third gender and being sexually neutral, Transgender people, especially the devotees of Lord Krishna, have been historically shown to bestow blessings. And, being sexually neutral was considered especially auspicious in Vedic culture because, the attraction between a man and woman was thought to create further attachments such as children due to procreation, and a home in terms of property, which would result in the living entities being entangled in ''samsara'', the cycle of repeated birth and death.

The people of the third sex have had a prominent role in the arts and entertainment.Historically referred to as Nartaka At the birth of a baby, N''artaka'' dancers would arrive, and dance and sing the name of the God Krishna, and bless the baby. As per custom, they were given precious jewellery and silks by the family of the baby for their contribution.

One more example of Transgender people being portrayed in Hindu history is that of Lord Arjuna being depicted as Brihannala in the Mahabharata, who was a person of third gender. Brihanalla was shown to be an instructor singing and dancing in King Virata’s court. But, Lord Arjuna/ Brihanalla was first tested for his third-sex nature by assuring he had no lust for females, and would have been examined for testicles if he had been a eunuch. This is not the first example of the presence of a person of third gender in Hindu texts, but this example most pertains to the topic of third gender people and their auspiciousness.

=== Transgender people in contemporary Indian society ===
In October 2013, "India's Supreme court stated that transgenders have remained untouchable in society with restricted access to education, health care and jobs. The justices criticized the government for such discrimination during a hearing of public interest litigation filed by the National Legal Services Authority".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agoramoorthy|first1=Govindasamy|last2=Hsu|first2=Minna J.|title=Living on the Societal Edge: India's Transgender Realities|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|date=2014|volume=54|issue=4|pages=1451–1459|doi=10.1007/s10943-014-9987-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem for Hijras first began during the British rule (1757-1947) with the introduction of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 1860 which declared homosexuality as a crime, and had an extended listing which has declared "Transgenders as criminal elements in society" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transgender people have been treated as outcasts within Indian society and thus have been "deprived of social and cultural participation for nearly two centuries." Many biologically male Hijras undergo a ritualized castration called nirva (sex reassignments).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have limited access to education, health care and public facilities and are treated as nonentities legally, which is in violation of the Constitution of India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite being recognized as legal citizens, only an estimated 25% of transgender people have obtained the national identification (Aadhar card). Transgender people are unable to "exercise their democratic rights in marriage, adopting/raising children and utilizing financial support system such as free and subsidized health care, surgeries and medical treatments" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been some support for transgender people as "The Supreme Court has directed the central government to place transgendered people in the other backward classes (OBCs) to classify their castes denoting their socially and economically disadvantaged status in society" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as they fall within the classification of people as defined in Article 15 (4) of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court of India has directed all Indian states to build separate restrooms for transgender people, and "to establish welfare agencies to enhance their health and medical needs." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Buddhism===
Most [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scripture]] does not distinguish same-sex sexual activity from heterosexual activity, both being seen as non-conducive to spiritual growth.&lt;ref name=Greenberg303&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Greenberg |editor-first=Yudit Kornberg |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions |volume=2 |page=303 |chapter=Homosexuality in Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoag6b3JvYC&amp;pg=PA303 |publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-981-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thai Buddhism]], being [[kathoey]] (an umbrella term that roughly maps to a range of things from MtF transsexualism to male homosexuality) is seen as being part of one's [[karma]] if it should be the case for a person. The response is one of "pity" rather than "blame". Kathoey are generally seen as not likely to form lasting relationships with men, and the lay explanation of their karma is that they are working out debts from adulterous behavior in past lives. In the past they disrupted marriages, and now they are doomed to never marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenscene.com/ironladies/reviews/questions.html|title=14 Questions |first=Andrew |last=Matzner |year=2000 |work=Golden Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, kathoey are still not allowed to legally become female or marry a man. Same-sex marriage is not possible in Thailand. Transgender women however can marry their European partners, if that is legislatively possible in their partner's country, and leave Thailand.

In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] monks take vows of celibacy, and self-control over sexual impulses is idealized as part of the path to [[nirvana]]. In the 1980s, in response to growing awareness of the AIDS crisis, some Buddhist writers drew on Buddhist teachings to argue that homosexual behavior was unnatural and unethical and demonstrated a lack of self-control. However, other Buddhist scholars have argued that karmic debt only accumulates around heterosexual immorality when patriarchal notions of male ownership of female sexuality are disrupted (for example, pre-marital sex is "theft of virginity" by a man from the woman's father). According to this view, the difficulties and pain of gender variant lives are part of how this debt is ''paid off'' in subsequent lives and as such it incurs no ''additional'' karmic debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enabling.org/ia/vipassana/Archive/J/Jackson/homoBuddhaJackson.html|title=Male Homosexuality and Transgenderism in the Thai Buddhist Tradition |first=Peter A. |last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shinto==
Shinto kami associated with same-sex love or gender variance include: [[shirabyōshi]], female or transgender kami represented as half-human, half-snake.

==Confucianism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
One issue that Confucianism is quite clear on is the importance of [[filial piety]] with an accompanying tradition of [[veneration of the dead]]. People are supposed to respect and obey their parents, get married, and then have children to extend their family lines. Gender variant people who are physically capable of living up to this standard would be generally encouraged to enter a marital relationship, have children, and be discreet about any additional relationships (for example homosexual partners) on the side, if absolutely necessary.

==Chinese religions==
[[Eunuchs]], male-bodied people castrated for royal services, existed in China from 1700 BC until 1924 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Jennifer W.|title=Another side of Chinese eunuch history: Castration, marriage, adoption, and burial|journal=Canadian Journal of History|date=December 1993|volume=28|issue=3|page=459|url=http://ijll.synergiesprairies.ca/index.php/jss/article/view/108/79|doi=10.3138/cjh.28.3.459|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502214830/http://ijll.synergiesprairies.ca/index.php/jss/article/view/108/79|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This social role had a long history, with a continuous community, and a highly public role. Before being castrated a Chinese eunuch would be asked if he "would ever regret being castrated" and if the answer was "no" then surgery would take place. It's an open question as to who would answer this way and why. The historical status of Chinese eunuchs was a curious mixture of extreme weakness and great power. The allure of power and influence were sometimes offered as excuses for the decision to become a eunuch. It has been speculated that Chinese monarchs trusted their eunuchs because the inability to have children left them with no motivation to seek power or riches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/eunuchs1.html|title=Hidden Power: The Palace Eunuchs of Imperial China|first=Mary M.|last=Anderson|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727020848/http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/%7Ephalsall/texts/eunuchs1.html|archivedate=27 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear to what extent eunuchs were transgender or otherwise gender-variant, but the history of eunuchs in Chinese culture is important to its views on transgender people.

==African religious beliefs==
The [[Akan people]] of [[Ghana]] have a pantheon of gods that includes personifications of [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. These personification manifest as androgynous and transgender deities, and include Abrao (Jupiter),&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 40, "Abrao"&lt;/ref&gt; Aku (Mercury),&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 47, "Aku"&lt;/ref&gt; and Awo (Moon).&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 79, "Awo"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the creation myth of the [[Dogon people]] the first 8 people on the earth, 4 men and 4 women, started the 8 Dogon families through a special arrangement with Amman where they could fertilize themselves, being dual and bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;Griaule, Marcel. Conversations with Ogotemmeli. London: Oxford, 1934. p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythology of the [[Shona people]] of [[Zimbabwe]] is ruled over by an androgynous creator god called [[Mwari]], who occasionally splits into separate male and female aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 243, "Mwari"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian Aboriginal==
The [[Rainbow Serpent]] [[Ungud]] has been described as androgynous. Shaman identify their erect penises with Ungud, and his androgyny inspires some to undergo ceremonial [[penile subincision]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 329, "Ungud"&lt;/ref&gt; Angamunggi is another Rainbow Serpent, worshipped as a "giver of life".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 58, "Angamunggi"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Australian mythological beings include [[Labarindja]], blue-skinned wild women or "demon women" with hair the colour of smoke.&lt;ref&gt;Róheim (2008), p. 388 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Stories about them show them to be completely uninterested in romance or sex with men, and any man forcing his attention upon them could die, due the "evil magic in their vaginas". They are sometimes depicted as gynandrous or intersex, having both a penis and a vagina. Ths is represented in ritual by having their part played by men in women's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 211, "Labarindja"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Islands==
Third gender, or gender variant, spiritual intermediaries are found in many pacific island cultures, including the [[bajasa]] of the eastern [[Toradja]] people of [[Sulawesi]], the [[bantut]] of the [[Tausūg people]] of the south [[Philippines]], and the [[bayoguin]] of the pre-Christian Philippines. These shamans are typically biologically male but display feminine behaviours and appearance, and are often homoerotically inclined.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 81, "Bajasa"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 82, "Bantut"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 85, "Bayoguin"&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Christian Philippines had a [[Polytheism|polytheistic religion]], which included the hermaphroditic gods [[Bathala]] and [[Malyari]], whose names means "Man and Woman in One" and "Powerful One" respectively; these gods are worshipped by the Bayagoin.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 84, "Bathala"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 225, "Malyari"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Big Nambas language|Big Nambas]] speakers of [[Vanuatu]] have the concept of divinely approved-of homoerotic relationships between men, with the older partner called the "dubut". This name is derived from the word for shark, referring to the patronage of the shark-human hybrid creator god [[Qat (deity)|Qat]].&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 90, "Big Nambas"&lt;/ref&gt;

Among their pantheon of deities, the [[Ngaju people]] of [[Borneo]] worship [[Mahatala-Jata]], an androgynous god. The male part of this god is [[Mahatala]], who rules the Upper World, and is depicted as a [[hornbill]] living above the clouds on a mountain-top; the female part is Jata, who rules the Underworld from under the sea in the form of a water-snake. These two manifestations are linked via a jewel-encrusted bridge that is seen in the physical world as a rainbow. Mahatala-Jata is served by "[[balian (mythology)|balian]]", female hierodules, and ''[[basir]]''", transgender shamans metaphorically described as "water snakes which are at the same time [[hornbill]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 224, "Mahatala-Jata"&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar transgender shamans, the ''manang bali'' (which literally means a transformed shaman from a male into a woman), are found in the [[Iban people]] in Borneo such as in Sarawak. ''Manang bali'' is the third and highest degree of shamanism after accomplishing the second degree of ''manang mansau'' "cooked shaman" and the first degree of ''manang mataq'' "uncooked shaman". The initiation ceremony for becoming a manang bali is called "Manang bangun manang enjun" which can be literally translated as the Awakened shaman, shaken shaman.&lt;ref&gt;"Manangism" By the Venerable Archdeacon J. Perham&lt;/ref&gt; After this ceremony, a manang bali dresses and acts like women and have homoerotic relationships. This makes them both the target of ridicule and respected as a spiritual intermediary. Boys fated to become manang bali may first dream of becoming a woman and also of being summoned by the god of medicine [[Menjaya Raja Manang]] or the goddess Ini Inee or Ini Andan, who is regarded the natural-born healer and the god of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 225, "Manang bali"&lt;/ref&gt; Menjaya Raja Manang began existence as a malegod, until their brother Sengalang Burong's wife became extremely sick. This prompted Menjaya into becoming the world's first healer, allowing him to cure his [[sister-in-law]], but this treatment also resulted in Menjaya changing into a woman or androgynous being.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 230, "Menjaya Raja Manang"&lt;/ref&gt; Menjaya was consecrated as the first manang bali by his own sister, Ini Inee Ini Andan in the first ever awakening-shaking ceremony and the first healing by a name-changing "belian" curing rite.

==Neopagan religion==
{{See also|Wicca and LGBT people}}
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
In most branches of [[Wicca]], a person's status as trans- or cisgender is not considered an issue. Transgender people are generally magickal people, according to Karla McLaren in her ''Energetic Boundaries'' study guide. Transgender people are almost always welcomed in individual communities, covens, study groups, and circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/gay-wicca.html |title=The Scoop on Gay Wicca |work=Wicca Spirituality: A New Wicca for a New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transgender people were initially attracted to [[Modern Paganism]] because of this inclusion.

However, there are some Neopagan groups that do not welcome transgender people. In some cases, this is because of the emphasis on the union of male and female, and the exclusion of transgender individuals from such practices.&lt;ref name="EncWitch"/&gt; Also, some [[separatism#Gender|gender separatist]] groups exclude transgender people, often on the basis that non-transgender individuals share certain spiritual qualities derived from genetic or biological sex.&lt;ref name="EncWitch"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first=Shelley|last=Rabinovitch|author2=James Lewis|publisher=Citadel Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0806524061
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dianic Wicca]] is an example of such a separatist group.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite book |last=Adler |first=Margaret |title=[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing down the moon: witches, Druids, goddess-worshippers, and other pagans in America]] |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=126 |isbn=0-14-303819-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical myth==
{{Main|LGBT themes in mythology}}

The patron god is [[Dionysus]], a god gestated in the thigh of his father Zeus, after his mother died from being overwhelmed by Zeus's true form.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_dionysus.html |title=Dionysus |work=Subjects in the Visual Arts |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |date=19 September 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712090224/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_dionysus.html |archivedate=12 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aphroditus]] was an [[androgyny|androgynous]] Aphrodite from [[Cyprus]] with a religious cult in which worshipers [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]],&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' iii.8&lt;/ref&gt; in later mythology became known as [[Hermaphroditus]], the son of Hermes and Aphrodite who merged bodies with the water nymph [[Salmacis]], transforming him into an androgynous being. In [[Phrygia]] there was [[Agdistis]], a hermaphroditic being created when Zeus unwittingly impregnated [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. The gods feared Agdistis and Dionysus castrated her; she then became the goddess [[Cybele]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' vii.17.§ 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Norse gods were capable of changing gender at will, for example [[Loki]], frequently disguised himself as a woman and gave birth to a foal while in the form of a white mare, after a sexual encounter with the stallion [[Svaðilfari]]. Comparison of a man to a child-bearing woman was a common insult in Scandinavia, and the implication that Loki may be bisexual was considered an insult.&lt;ref name=viklady&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/gayvik.shtml |title=Homosexuality in Viking Scandinavia |work=The Viking Answer Lady}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human fertility was a major aspect of Egyptian mythology, and was often entwined with the crop fertility provided by annual flooding of the river Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmerman |first1=Bonnie |last2=Haggerty |first2=George E. |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-1920-7 |page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection was shown in iconography of Nile-gods, such as [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]], god of the [[Nile]], and [[Wadj-wer]], god of the [[Nile Delta]], who although male were depicted with female attributes such as pendulous breasts, symbolizing the fertility the river provides.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p.170, "Hapy"&lt;/ref&gt;
