{{Year nav topic5|1977|radio|music|television|home video}}
In the year '''1977''', significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]''' included the [[President of the United States]] participating in a call-in radio program.

==Events==
*January – [[KIIK-FM|WRSQ-FM]] (104.9) signs on the air in [[Geneseo, Illinois]] as a sister station to WGEN-AM (1500 AM). The station's first call letters are short-lived, as the station will quickly adopt the callsign WGEN-FM. The initial format is [[country music]] with a community focus.
*February 18 – [[Belgischer Rundfunk]] (BRF) is founded and takes over responsibility for [[public service broadcasting|public-service]] radio broadcasting in the [[German language]] in Belgium.
*March 5 - President [[Jimmy Carter]] participates with [[Walter Cronkite]] in the ''Dial-a-President'' radio program on [[CBS]].
*May 12 - [[WTIC-FM]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] switches from [[European classical music|classical music]] to a new [[Top 40]] format designed by consultant [[Mike Joseph]]. This successful new approach will later be termed [[Hot Hits]].
*August 16 - Radio and television stations nationwide interrupt regular programming to report the death of [[Elvis Presley]].
*September 1 -- Dave Lingafelt begins airing "The Whacky Wake Up Crew" on [[WNNC]]-AM in Newton, North Carolina. He has been on the air for more than 35 years and has since purchased another AM station as well as 95.7 WXRC "The Ride."

===No dates===
*[[KSTP-FM]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] adopts its long-running [[soft rock]] format.

==Debuts==
*3 February: ''Adventure Theater'' (a children's program, not to be confused with ''[[Adventure Theater]]'', a 1956 anthology series on [[NBC]]) debuts on [[CBS]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closings==
*29 May: [[NBC Radio Network|NBC Radio]]'s all-news "News and Information Service" ceases operations, citing a low number of affiliates. Most stations switch to different formats, but [[KQV]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] launched a locally based production for its all-news format, which it maintains to the present day.

==Births==
* November - [[Heidi Cortez]], American model, writer, and radio host

==Deaths==
* [[Bud Ballou]], radio [[disc jockey]]
* [[Sid Collins]], (55, American broadcaster best known as the radio voice of the [[Indianapolis 500]] on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]] from 1952 to 1976.

The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the New York-based private non-profit organization [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that is dedicated to [[Historic preservation|preserving]] the [[cultural heritage|historic, artistic, and architectural heritage]] around the world.&lt;ref name=2006_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = World Monuments Fund Announces 2006 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites | publisher = World Monuments Fund | author = Holly Evarts | date = 21 June 2005 | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate = 16 May 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that is in urgent need of preservation funding and protection. It is a call to action on behalf of threatened cultural heritage monuments worldwide. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = World Monuments Fund Announces 2008 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites | author = Holly Evarts | date = 6 June 2007 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url = http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090521092007/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf |archivedate = 21 May 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=2006_press_release /&gt; A site’s inclusion on the Watch List attracts international attention, helping to raise funds needed for its rescue and spurring local governments and communities to take an active role in protecting the cultural landmark.

==2004 Watch List==
The 2004 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was launched on 24 September 2003 by WMF President [[Bonnie Burnham]] and WMF partner [[American Express]].&lt;ref name=2004_press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = 2004 List of 100 Most Endangered Sites Announced | publisher = World Monuments Fund | date = 24 September 2003 | url = http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/wmf04/index.html |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, a site from [[Antarctica]] was included, ensuring that the Watch List geographically covers every continent.&lt;ref name=2004_press_release /&gt;
{{cquote|By working to preserve these treasures, WMF and its partners are helping to save for future generations the structures and places that tell us who we are. Be it a palace, a cave painting, an archaeological site, or a town, the sites on the Watch list speak of human aspirations and achievements. To lose any one of them would diminish us all.|200px||Bonnie Burnham, WMF president|launch of 2004 Watch List&lt;ref name="WMF 2004 Watch List press release"/&gt;}}

'''Afrocentrism''' (also '''Afrocentricity''') is an approach to the study of world history that focuses on the history of people of recent{{what|date=November 2018}} [[Africa]]n descent. It is in some respects a response to global ([[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]]) attitudes about [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their historical contributions; it seeks to correct mistakes and ideas perpetuated by the racist philosophical underpinnings of western academic disciplines as they developed during and since Europe's Early Renaissance as justifying rationales for the enslavement of other peoples, in order to enable more accurate accounts of not only African but all people's contributions to world history.&lt;ref&gt;CC Verharen, “Molefi Asante...”, The Western Journal of Black Studies, (24)4, 2000, pp. 223-238&lt;/ref&gt;  Afrocentricity deals primarily with [[self-determination]] and African agency and is a [[Pan-African]] point of view for the study of culture, [[philosophy]], and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asante.net/articles/1/afrocentricity/ Asante on Afrocentricity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Africana"&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]], and [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] (eds), ''[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American]]'' Volume 1, p. 111, Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517055-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrocentrism is a scholarly movement that seeks to conduct research and education on global history subjects, from the perspective of historical African peoples and polities. It takes a critical stance on Euro-centric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, [[Near East]]ern and [[Asian culture|Asian]] cultural influences while exagerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of [[Africa]] and its role in contemporary African-American culture and Greek philosophy among others.

What is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography.&lt;ref&gt;General History of Africa, Vol 1, p41, UNESCO, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; A notable pioneer is the professor [[Kenneth Dike]] of the [[University of Ibadan]], who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct historiography, reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="nathanielturner1"&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm Wilson J. Moses: Historical Sketches of Afrocentrism].&lt;/ref&gt; Today{{when|date=December 2017}} it is primarily associated with [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], [[Ivan van Sertima]] and [[Molefi Asante]].&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Asante, ''The Painful Demise of Eurocentrism: An Afrocentric Response to Critics'', foreword by [[Maulana Karenga]]: "Molefi Asante, the founding and preeminent theorist of Afrocentricity, is one of the most important intellectuals at work today. This work continues his tradition of combining an extraordinary intellectual range with an impressive ability to identify and clarify central issues in the current discourse on Afrocentricity, multiculturalism, race, culture, ethnicity and related themes. Dr. Asante offers an insightful and valuable response to Eurocentric critics of the Afrocentric initiative while simultaneously addressing a wide range of issues critical to understanding this important intellectual enterprise, including African agency, location, orientation, centerdness, subject-place and cultural groundedness. The volume is thoughtful, multifaceted and rewarding, and yields a rich sense of the contours and complexity of the Afrocentric project." --Dr. Maulana Karenga, Chair, Department of Black Studies, California State University, Long Beach."&lt;/ref&gt; Cheick Anta Diop is the primary source of African-centred academic literature, the methodology of his research on the Nubian origins of Egyptian civilization earned him authorship of a chapter in [[UNESCO]]'s General History of Africa manual, called "Origin of the Ancient Egyptians" &lt;ref&gt;General History of Africa, Vol 2, p27, UNESCO, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Afrocentrism support the claim that the contributions of various Black African people have been downplayed or discredited as part of the legacy of [[colonialism]] and slavery's [[pathology]] of "writing Africans out of history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3819303 Rewriting History, Rebel and Motherhood by Susan Andrade].p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodson|first=Carter Godwin|authorlink=Carter G.

==Terminology==
The term "Afrocentrism" dates to 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moses|first=Wilson Jeremiah|authorlink=|title=Afrotopia: The Roots of African American Popular History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hx0LGNxO_mAC&amp;pg=PA44|date=13 September 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47941-7|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "Afrocentric" appears in a typescript proposal for an entry in ''[[Encyclopedia Africana]]'', possibly due to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elegant Inconsistencies: Race, Nation, and Writing in Wilson Jeremiah Moses's Afrotopia|last=Levine|first=Robert|doi=10.1093/alh/ajn016|url=http://alh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ajn016|year=2008|journal=American Literary History|volume=20|page=497|issue=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214084822/http://alh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ajn016|archivedate=14 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abstract noun "Afrocentricity" dates to the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thairu, Kihumbu|title=The African Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOk_AAAAYAAJ|year=1975|publisher=[[East African Literature Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} and was popularized by [[Molefi Asante]]'s ''Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change'' (1980). Afrocentrists led by Molefe Asante have organised their critics into three categories, Capitulationists, Europeanised Loyalists, and Maskers. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Capitulationists condemn Afrocentricity because they are uncomfortable with themselves and do not believe that Africans should be considered agents. They include amongst black scholars Anthony Appiah and Stanley Crouch. The functioning element for these critics is self-hatred, accompanied by the belief that these African critics are really nothing but whites in black skin. Their rejection of Afrocentricity is tied to their rejection of themselves. Europeanised Loyalists include many Marxists and integrationists such as Mary Lefkowitz, Stanley Crouch, and Wilson Moses (staunch critics of Afrocentricity), who believe that blacks can do no good. These critics are strangers to the Afrocentric idea because they have immersed themselves in alien canon of knowledge without knowing African history. The last type, the Maskers, are the critics who are ashamed of Afrocentricity and therefore do all they can to conceal their identities. Their tragedy is that they seek to please the master so they attack Afrocentrists to prove to whites that they are like them. They fear that they may lose their careers"&lt;ref&gt;MK Asante, Afrocentricity: The theory of social change..., p. 7; MK Asante&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Afrocentricity and its critics…” (available at http://science.jrank.org/pages/8216/Afrocentricity-Afrocentricity-Its-Critics.html, as accessed on 2 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
[[File:bois.jpg|thumbnail|120px|A 1911 copy of the [[NAACP]] journal ''[[The Crisis]]'' depicting "Ra-Maat-Neb, one of the kings of the Upper Nile", a copy of the relief portraying [[Amanitenmemide|Nebmaatre I]] on [[Pyramids of Meroe (Begarawiyah)|Meroe pyramid 17]].]]
Afrocentrism has its origins in the work of [[Africa]]n and [[African diaspora]] intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of [[slavery]] and the decline of [[colonialism]]. Following the [[American Civil War]], African Americans in the [[Southern United States|South]] gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, W. E. B., ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''.

{{Quote|The combination of the European centuries gives us about four to five hundred years of solid European domination of intellectual concepts and philosophical ideas. Africa and Asia were subsumed under various headings of the European hierarchy. If a war between the European powers occurred it was called a World War and the Asians and Africans found their way on the side of one European power or the other.There was this sense of assertiveness about European culture that advanced with Europe's trade, religious, and military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asante.net/articles/51/de-westernizing-communication-strategies-for-neutralizing-cultural-myths/ De-Westernizing Communication: Strategies for Neutralizing Cultural Myths].&lt;/ref&gt;|Molefi Asante|"De-Westernizing Communication: Strategies for Neutralizing Cultural Myths"}}

As an ideology and political movement, Afrocentrism had its beginnings in activism among black intellectuals, political figures, and historians in the context of the US American [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olaniyan, T.

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} According to U.S. professor Victor Oguejiofor Okafor, concepts of Afrocentricity lie at the core of disciplines such as [[African American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Oguejiofor Okafor, "The Place of Africalogy in the University Curriculum", ''Journal of Black Studies'', vol. 26 no. 6, July 1999, pp. 688–712.&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Wilson J. Moses]] claims that Afrocentrism roots are not exclusively African:
{{Quote|Despite the fulminations of ethno-chauvinists and other prejudiced persons, it remains a fact that the contributions of white scholars, like Boas, Malinowski, and Herskovits, were fundamental to that complex of ideas that we designate to days as Afrocentrism...Students of African and African American history have long appreciated the irony that much of what we now call Afrocentrism was developed during the 1930s by the Jewish American scholar [[Melville Herskovits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm |title=Two Scholars Discuss Afrocentrism |publisher=Nathanielturner.com |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Wilson J.

In 1987, [[Martin Bernal]] published his ''[[Black Athena]]'', in which he claims that ancient Greece was colonized by northern invaders mixing with a colony established by [[Phoenicia]] (modern Lebanon). A major theme of the work is the alleged denial by Western academia of the African and (western) Asiatic influence on ancient Greek culture.

==Aspects==

===Afrocentricity book===
{{main|Afrocentricity (book)}}
In 2000, [[Molefi Kete Asante]], chair of the Department of African American Studies at [[Temple University]] gave a lecture at the [[University of Liverpool]] entitled "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium,"&lt;ref&gt;Kete Asante, Molefi, [http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium"], University of Liverpool, 2 August 2000, accessed 11 February 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302025412/http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html |date=2 March 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented many of his ideas:
* Africa has been betrayed by international commerce, by [[missionaries]] and [[imams]], by the structure of knowledge imposed by the Western world, by its own leaders, and by the ignorance of its own people of its past.
* [[Philosophy]] originated in Africa and the first philosophers in the world were Africans.
* Afrocentricity constitutes a new way of examining data, and a novel orientation to data; it carries with it assumptions about the current state of the African world.
* His aim is "to help lay out a plan for the recovery of African place, respectability, accountability, and leadership."
* Afrocentricity can stand its ground among any ideology or religion: Marxism, [[Islam]], Christianity, Buddhism, or [[Judaism]]. Your Afrocentricity will emerge in the presence of these other ideologies because it is from you.
* Afrocentrism is the only ideology that can liberate African people.

Asante also stated:
{{quote|As a cultural configuration, the Afrocentric idea is distinguished by five characteristics:
# an intense interest in psychological location as determined by symbols, motifs, rituals, and signs.
# a commitment to finding the subject-place of Africans in any social, political, economic, or religious phenomenon with implications for questions of sex, gender, and class.
# a defence of African cultural elements as historically valid in the context of art, music, and literature.
# a celebration of centeredness and agency and a commitment to lexical refinement that eliminates pejoratives about Africans or other people.
# a powerful imperative from historical sources to revise the collective text of African people.}}
However, Wilson J. Moses, said of Asante: "His second book, ''The Afrocentric Idea'' (1987), was a creative and in some respects brilliant but rambling theoretical work, much influenced by the revolution in "[[critical theory]]" that occurred in American intellectual life during the late 1970s and early 1980s."&lt;ref name="nathanielturner1"/&gt; Some also assert that the definition of Afrocentricity has never sat still long enough to be properly described and accurately critiqued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Afrocentric education===
{{Main|Afrocentric education}}
Afrocentric education is education designed to empower peoples of the African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Dr. Carter G. (1933). ''The Mis-Education of the Negro''. Khalifah's Booksellers &amp; Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; To control a people's culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar, Dr. Na'im (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Paulo Freire|educational leaders of other cultures]], proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.

===Afrocentric theology===
{{Further|Black theology|Black church}}
The [[black church]] in the United States developed out of the [[creolization]] of African spirituality and European-American [[Christianity]]; early members of the churches made certain stories their own{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. During the [[American Civil War|antebellum]] years, the idea of deliverance out of [[slavery]], as in the story of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], was especially important{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with [[Jesus]], and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Twentieth-century "Africentric approaches" to Christian [[theology]] and preaching have been more deliberate.

===Race and Pan-African identity===
{{anchor|race}}
{{further|Ancient Egyptian race controversy|Pan-Africanism}}
Many Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} seek to challenge concepts such as [[white privilege]], [[Color blindness (race)|color-blind]] perspectives, and race-neutral pedagogies. There are strong ties between Afrocentricity and [[Critical race theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo, Zeus (2005). ''Critical Pedagogy and Race'', p. 129 {{ISBN|1-4051-2968-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrocentrists agree with the current scientific consensus that holds that Africans exhibit a range of types and physical characteristics, and that such elements as wavy hair or aquiline facial features are part of a continuum of African types that do not depend on admixture with Caucasian groups. They cite work by Hiernaux&lt;ref name=Hiernaux&gt;{{cite book

Afrocentrists have condemned what they consider to be attempts at dividing African peoples into racial clusters as new versions of discredited theories, such as the [[Hamitic#Hamitic hypothesis|Hamitic hypothesis]] and the [[Dynastic Race Theory]]. These theories, they contend, attempted to identify certain African ethnicities, such as Nubians, Ethiopians and Somalis, as "Caucasoid" groups that entered Africa to bring civilization to the natives. They believe that Western academics have traditionally limited the peoples they defined as "Black" Africans to those south of the [[Sahara]], but used broader "Caucasoid" or related categories to classify peoples of Egypt or North Africa. Afrocentrists also believe strongly in the work of certain anthropologists who have suggested that there is little evidence to support that the first North African populations were closely related to "Caucasoids" of Europe and western Asia.&lt;ref name="Hiernaux"/&gt;

In 1964 Afrocentric scholar [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] expressed a belief in such a double standard:
{{quote|But it is only the most gratuitous theory that considers the Dinka, the Nouer and the Masai, among others, to be Caucasoids. What if an African ethnologist were to persist in recognising as white only the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, and systematically refused membership to the remaining Europeans, and Mediterraneans in particular—the French, Italians, Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese? Just as the inhabitants of Scandinavia and the Mediterranean countries must be considered as two extreme poles of the same anthropological reality, so should the Negroes of East and West Africa be considered as the two extremes in the reality of the Negro world. To say that a Shillouk, a Dinka, or a Nouer is a Caucasoid is for an African as devoid of sense and scientific interest as would be, to a European, an attitude that maintained that a Greek or a Latin were not of the same race.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}}}

French historian Jean Vercoutter has claimed that [[archaeological]] workers routinely classified Negroid remains as Mediterranean, even though they found such remains in substantial numbers with ancient artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Vercoutter, ''The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering Meroitic Script''. Paris: UNESCO, 1978, pp. 15–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} have adopted a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] perspective that people of color are all "African people" or "[[diaspora|diasporic]] Africans," citing physical characteristics they exhibit in common with Black Africans. Afrocentric scholar [[Runoko Rashidi]] writes that they are all part of the "global African community." Some Afrocentric writers include in the [[African diaspora]] the [[Dravidians]] of India, "[[Negrito]]s" of Southeast Asia ([[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Malaysia]]); and the [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples of Australia and Melanesia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A few Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} claim that the [[Olmecs]] of [[Mexico]] were a hybrid society of Native American peoples and Africans. Mainstream historians of Mesoamerica overwhelmingly reject that view with detailed rebuttals.&lt;ref name=Ortiz1997&gt;{{cite journal

===Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas theories===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories}}
In the 1970s, [[Ivan van Sertima]] advanced the theory that the complex civilizations of the Americas were the result of trans-oceanic influence from the Egyptians or other African civilizations. Such a claim is his primary thesis in ''They Came Before Columbus'', published in 1978. The few [[Trans-cultural diffusion|hyper-diffusionist]] writers seek to establish that the [[Olmec]] people, who built the first highly complex civilization in [[Mesoamerica]] and are considered by some to be the mother civilization for all other civilizations of Mesoamerica, were deeply influenced by Africans. Van Sertima said that the Olmec civilization was a hybrid one of Africans and Native Americans. His theory of pre-Columbian American-African contact has since met with considerable and detailed opposition by scholars of Mesoamerica. Van Sertima has been accused of "doctoring" and twisting data to fit his conclusions, inventing evidence, and ignoring the work of respected Central and South American scholars in the advance of his own theory.&lt;ref name="Ortiz1997"/&gt;

===Afrocentrism and Ancient Egypt===

Several Afrocentrists have claimed that important cultural characteristics of ancient [[Egypt]] were indigenous to Africa and that these features were present in other early African civilizations&lt;ref name=Diop1964&gt;{{cite journal

The claim has also been made by many Afrocentric scholars that the Ancient Egyptians themselves were [[Black African]] (sub-saharan African) rather than North African/Maghrebi, and that the various invasions on Egypt resulted in the Africanity of Ancient Egypt becoming diluted, resulting in the modern diversity seen today.&lt;ref name="Ivan van Sertima 1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Van Sertima, Ivan|title=Egypt, Child of Africa|authorlink=Ivan van Sertima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7KmBTz2vUoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2-IA1,M1|year=1994|isbn=1-56000-792-3 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

Scholars have challenged the various assertions of Afrocentrists on the cultural and biological characteristics of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its people. At a [[UNESCO]] Symposium in the 1970s, the vast majority of the delegates repudiated the Afrocentric assertions.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings", (Paris, 1978), pp. 3–134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zahi Hawass]] has gone on record as saying that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and Ancient Egypt was not a Black African Civilization.&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929 |title=Egyptology News" Blog Archive " Hawass says that Tutankhamun was not black |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2009-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727185516/http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929 |archive-date=27 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite contestations, [[UNESCO]] decided to include his "Origin of the ancient Egyptians" in the General History of Africa, with an editorial comment mentioning the disagreement. 
It should also be noted that the ancient world did not employ racial categories such as "Black" or "White" as they had no conception of "race", but rather labeled groups according to their land of origin and cultural traits. However, [[S. O. Y. Keita]], a biological anthropologist studying the controversy, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as "black" or "white" to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthropology News'', December 2007, Vol. 48, No. 9, pp. 19-20, {{doi|10.1525/an.2007.48.9.19}}; see also "Forensic Misclassification of Ancient Nubian Crania: Implications for Assumptions About Human Variation", Frank L'Engle Williams, Robert L.

===Hamitic hypothesis===
Stephen Howe summarizes the development of the Hamitic hypothesis in the 19th and 20th centuries as Eurocentric. He further describes how some Afrocentric writers adopted 'their version' of it. Howe distinguishes three clusters of controversies related to the history of [[Ancient Egypt]]. About the third cluster he says that these are "controversies that have been especially salient in relation to the United States, have interacted heavily with sensitive issues of current public policy, and involve questions both wide and fundamentally about the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howe, Stephen|title=Afrocentrism: mythical pasts and imagined homes|publisher=Verso|location=London|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

{{quote|Thus, if historical myths and legends, or an invented history, play such a major role in the founding of every national reconstruction, the question that should concern us here is the nature of the distinct style in which black Americans imagine their past. The answer to this question is that radical Afrocentrism, the subject of this study, which plays a central role in shaping the modern historical world-view of a large section of the African-American (or Afro-American) community, is far more than an effort to follow the line taken by many [[ethnic]] groups and nations in modern rewriting, inventing or developing collective identity and national history. Rather, it is a large-scale historical project to rewrite the history of the whole of humankind from an Afrocentric point of view. The result is a new reconstruction of world history: it is a universal history.}}

[[Mary Lefkowitz]], Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts, has rejected [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s theories about Egyptian contributions to Greek civilization as being faulty scholarship. She notes that he used sources that predated the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. He failed to acknowledge that many of his theories were overturned by the evidence of later findings. She contends that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz also pointed out that [[Aristotle]] could not have stolen his ideas from the great [[Library at Alexandria]] as James suggested, because the library was founded ''after'' Aristotle's death. Because of such fundamental errors of fact, Lefkowitz has criticized Afrocentrism as "an excuse to teach myth as history."&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz1996"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1994 the Manhattan Institute, a public policy forum, published ''Alternatives to Afrocentrism'', a collection of highly critical essays by, among others, Lefkowitz, [[Gerald Early]], Stanley Crouch, Wilson Moses, and Frank Yurco. Early, an African American, has been especially critical and dismisses Afrocentrism as just another North American experiment in "group therapy," a kind of "intellectual fast food".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 2002 Ibrahim Sundiata noted in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' that 
{{quote|The word "Afrocentric" has been traced by Derrick Alridge to the American historian W.E.B. Du Bois, who employed it in the early 1960s. During the 1970s, Molefi Kete Asante appropriated the term, insisting that he was the only person equipped to define it, and asserting that even the holy archangels Du Bois and [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] had an imperfect and immature grasp of a concept that finds ultimate expression in his own pontifications. Subsequently, it became a catchall "floating signifier," nebulous, unstable, and infinitely mutable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://way.net/dissonance/sundiata.html Ibrahim Sundiata, "The Argument We Are Really Having"], ''American Historical Review'', (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cain Hope Felder]], a Professor of [[New Testament]] Language and Literature at [[Howard University]] and supporter of Afrocentric ideas, has warned Afrocentrists to avoid certain pitfalls,&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hope Felder | first1 = Cain | year = 1994 | title = Afrocentrism, the Bible, and the Politics of Difference | url = http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm | journal = The Princeton Seminary Bulletin | volume = XV | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* Demonizing categorically all white people, without careful differentiation between persons of goodwill and those who consciously perpetuate racism.
* Adopting [[multiculturalism]] as a curricular alternative that eliminates, marginalizes, or vilifies European heritage to the point that Europe epitomizes all the evil in the world.
* Gross over-generalizations and using factually or incorrect material is bad history and bad scholarship.&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt;

[[Nathan Glazer]] writes that although Afrocentricity can mean many things, the popular press has generally given most attention to its most outlandish theories.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"&gt;Nathan Glazer, ''We Are All Multiculturalists Now'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-674-94836-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glazer agrees with many of the findings and conclusions presented in Lefkowitz's book ''Not Out of Africa''. Yet he also argues that Afrocentrism often presents legitimate and relevant scholarship.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"/&gt; The late [[Manning Marable]] was also a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"/&gt;
{{Quote|Populist Afrocentrism was the perfect social theory for the upwardly mobile black petty bourgeoisie. It gave them a sense of ethnic superiority and cultural originality, without requiring the hard, critical study of historical realities. It provided a philosophical blueprint to avoid concrete struggle within the real world.... It was, in short, only the latest theoretical construct of a politics of racial identity, a world-view designed to discuss the world but never really to change it.|Manning Marable| Beyond Black and White: Transforming African American Politics}}

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} agree in rejecting those works which critics have characterized as examples of bad scholarship. Adisa A. Alkebulan notes that the work of Afrocentric scholars is not fully appreciated because critics use the claims of "a few non-Afrocentrists" as "an indictment against Afrocentricity."&lt;ref name="DefendingtheParadigm"&gt;Adisa A. Alkebulan, "Defending the Paradigm", ''Journal of Black Studies'', Vol. 37, No. 3, pp. 410–427 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the historian [[August Meier]] critically reviewed the new work of Mary Lefkowitz on Afrocentrism as "Eurocentric". He criticized her book ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History'' for what he saw as her neglect of the African-American historic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. Meier believes she fails to take the African-American experiences into account, to the extent that she "fails to answer the question raised in this book's subtitle".&lt;ref&gt;Meier, August, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2945660 "Review: Mary Lefkowitz, ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History''"], ''Journal of American History'', December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maghan Keita]] describes the controversy over Afrocentrism as a [[cultural war]]. He believes certain "epistemologies" are warring with each other: the "epistemology of blackness" argues for the "responsibilities and potential of black peoples to function in and contribute to the progress of civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Maghan Keita, ''Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Age of Revolution''' is the period from approximately 1774 to 1849 in which a number of significant [[revolution]]ary movements occurred in many parts of Europe and the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matson, Cathy|title=The Atlantic Economy in an Era of Revolutions: An Introduction|publisher=William and Mary Quarterly|date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period is noted for the change in government from [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist monarchies]] to [[constitutionalist|constitutionalist states]] and [[republic]]s. The Age of Revolution includes the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]], the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], the [[Haitian Revolution]], the revolt of [[slave]]s in [[Latin America]], the [[First Italian War of Independence]], [[Sicilian revolution of 1848]], and the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|1848 revolutions in Italy]]; and the independence movements of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in Latin America. In a way, it includes the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The period would generally weaken the [[imperialism|imperialist]] European states, who would lose major assets throughout the [[New World]]. For the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] would bring a [[British Empire#Rise of the "Second" British Empire (1783–1815)|change in direction]] for the [[British Empire]], with [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] becoming new targets for expansion.

The expression was popularised by the British historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in his book ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]].''&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric, ''The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848'', London, Abacus (1962). &lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Revolution==
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}
The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. It marked a major turning point in history and almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. This led to the expansion of cities that was so rapid, it resulted in social strains and disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Collective Behavior|last=Smelser|first=Neil|publisher=Quid Pro Books|year=2011|isbn=9781610270854|location=New Orleans|pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, economic grievances associated with this industrialization fed later revolutions such as those that transpired from 1848.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution: Steam and Steel|last=Wolfe|first=James|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2015|isbn=9781680480283|location=New York|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; New social classes emerged including those that began to reject orthodox politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=Hudson|first=Pat|publisher=Hodder Arnold|year=1992|isbn=9780713165319|location=New York|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated by the rise of the urban [[middle class]], which became a powerful force so that they had to be integrated into the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Empire to Europe: The Decline and Revival of British Industry Since the Second World War|last=Owens|first=Geoffrey|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2017|isbn=9780006387503|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upheavals also led to new political ideas that were directed against the social arrangements of the preindustrial regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==American Revolution (1775–1783)==
{{Main|American Revolution}}
The [[Thirteen Colonies]] of British America famously became independent in the [[American Revolution]] of 1776. The movement was the first European colony to claim independence and saw the application of elected government, a constitution, and limited civil rights, none of which were unheard of but were unique in their combination. This was the birth of the United States of America.

==French Revolution (1789–1799)==
{{Main|French Revolution}}
The French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France from 1789 to 1799 that profoundly affected French and modern history, marking the decline of powerful monarchies and churches and the rise of democracy and nationalism. Popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and aristocracy grew amidst an economic crisis following two expensive wars and years of bad harvests, motivating demands for change. These were couched in terms of Enlightenment ideals and caused the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789.

==Haitian Revolution (1791–1804)==
{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}
The Haitian Revolution was a slave revolt in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which culminated in the elimination of slavery there and the founding of the Republic of Haiti. The Haitian Revolution was the only slave revolt which led to the founding of a state. Furthermore, it is generally considered the most successful slave rebellion ever to have occurred and as a defining moment in the histories of both Europe and the Americas. The rebellion began with a revolt of black African slaves in August 1791. It ended in November 1803 with the French defeat at the battle of Vertières. Haiti became an independent country on January 1, 1804.

==United Irishmen Rebellion (1798)==
{{Main|Irish Rebellion of 1798}}
In 1798, Irishmen rose against British Rule in Ireland in the hopes of creating a Republic. The rebellion was initiated by the Society of United Irishmen and led by Theobald Wolfe Tone. They rebelled against the government for a number of reasons but most notably due to the sectarian nature of British Rule, which upheld the Penal Laws that discrimated against Catholics and Presbyterians in Irish society. The rebellion failed and led to the Act of Union in 1801.

== Serbian Revolution (1804–1835) ==
{{Main|Serbian Revolution}}
The Serbian Revolution was a national uprising and constitutional change in [[Serbia]] that took place between 1804 and 1835, during which the territory evolved from an [[Belgrade Pashaluk|Ottoman province]] into a rebel territory, a [[Constitution of Serbia|constitutional monarchy]], and finally the modern Serbian state. The first part of the period, from 1804 to 1815, was marked by a violent struggle for independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] with two armed uprisings taking place, ending with a ceasefire. During the later period (1815–1835) a peaceful consolidation of political power developed in the increasingly autonomous Serbia, culminating in the recognition of the right to hereditary rule by [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian princes]] in 1830 and 1833 and the territorial expansion of the young monarchy. The adoption of the first written [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]] in 1835 abolished [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]], and made the country [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]. The term "Serbian Revolution" was coined by a German academic historiographer, [[Leopold von Ranke]], in his book ''Die Serbische Revolution'', published in 1829. These events marked the foundation of the modern [[Principality of Serbia]].

Scholars have characterized the Serbian War of Independence and subsequent national liberation as a revolution because the uprisings were started by broad masses of rural Serbian people who were in severe class conflict with the Turkish landowners as a political and economic masters at the same time, similar to [[Greek War of Independence|Greece in 1821–1832]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Latin American Wars of Independence (1808–1833)==
{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|War of Independence of Brazil}}

Latin America experienced [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence revolutions]] in the early 19th century that separated the colonies from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], creating new nations. These movements were generally led by the ethnically Spanish but locally born [[Creole people|Creole]] class; these were often wealthy citizens that held high positions of power but were still poorly respected by the European-born Spaniards. One such Creole was [[Simón Bolívar]], who led several revolutions throughout South America and helped establish [[Gran Colombia]]. Another important figure was [[José de San Martín]], who helped create the [[United Provinces of Rio de la Plata]] and became the first president of [[Peru]]. Some Latin American revolts, such as the Haitian Revolution, were led by slaves.

==Greek War of Independence (1821–1832)==
{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}
Greece in the early part of the 1800s was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. A series of revolts, starting in 1821, began the conflict. The Ottoman Empire sent in forces to suppress the revolts. By 1827, forces from Russia, Great Britain, and France entered the conflict, helping the Greeks drive the Turkish forces off the Peloponnese Peninsula. The Turks finally recognized Greece as a free nation in May 1832.

==Revolutions of 1820==
{{main|Revolutions of 1820}}

==Revolutions of 1830==
{{main|Revolutions of 1830}}

==Revolutions of 1848==
{{Main|Revolutions of 1848}}
The European Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Spring of Nations, Springtime of the Peoples or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history, but within a year, reactionary forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed. 

The political impact of the 1848 revolutions was more evident in Austria in comparison to the revolution's effects in countries like Germany. This is attributed to the way the upheavals in Vienna resulted in greater loss of life and gained stronger support from intellectuals, students, and the working class.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 1848 Revolutions in German-Speaking Europe|last=Hahn|first=Hans Joachim|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780582357655|location=Oxon|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account described the German experience as less concerned with national issues, although it succeeded in breaking down class barriers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There was a previously prevalent view that there was only one revolutionary event in Germany but recent scholarship pointed to a fragmented picture of several revolutions happening at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Revolutions in Europe, 1848-1849: From Reform to Reaction|last=Evans|first=Robert John|last2=von Strandmann|first2=Hartmut Pogge|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0199249970|location=Oxford|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1848 revolutions were also notable because of the increased participation of women. While women rarely participated in revolutionary activities, there were those who performed supportive and auxiliary roles such as the cases of the women's political club in [[Vienna]], which demanded revolutionary measures from the Austrian Constituent Assembly, and the Parisian women who protested and proposed their own solutions to social problems, particularly those involving their rights and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The European Revolutions, 1848-1851|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=0521839076|location=Cambridge|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Eureka Rebellion (1856)==
{{Main|Eureka Rebellion}}
The Eureka Rebellion was a 20 minute shootout between the Miners of Ballarat, Victoria, against the British Redcoats. After the imposition of Gold Mining Licences, that being that a person had one of these to mine gold, and which costed 30 shillings a month to own a license, the miners decided that it was to much. So the Ballarat Miners started rallies at Bakery Hill and burnt their licenses, took an oath under the flag of the Southern Cross, elected Peter Lalor as their rebellion leader, and built a stockade (a makeshift fort) around the diggings. Eventually the Redcoats led by Governor Hotham of Ballarat fired upon the stockade. The miners fired back and lasted 20 minutes before being overthrown by the Redcoats. Most of the miners were arrested by the British, and taken to trial. If found guilty, they would hang for high treason. Even though it lasted only 20 minutes, it was the beginning of Democracy for all Australians.

==Taiping Revolution (1850-1864)==
{{Main|Taiping Rebellion}}
The Taiping Rebellion was a revolt against the [[Qing dynasty]] in China, fought with religious conviction over regional economic conditions, and lasting from 1850 to 1864. The Taiping forces were run as a cult-like group called the God Worshipping Society by self-proclaimed prophet [[Hong Xiuquan]], and resulted in the rebels seizing the city of [[Nanjing]] for a decade. The Taiping Rebellion eventually failed, however, and led to the deaths of more than 20 million people.

'''Anthropogeny''' is the '''study of human origins'''. It is not simply a synonym for [[human evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which is only a part of the processes involved in human origins. Many other factors besides biological [[evolution]] were involved, ranging over climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural ones. Anthropogenesis, meaning the process or point of becoming human, is also called [[hominization]].

==History of usage==
{{Life timeline}}
The term ''anthropogeny'' was used in the 1839 edition of [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper]]'s  ''Medical Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooper (physician)|Robert Hooper]], M.D. (1839) ''A New Medical Dictionary Containing the Explanation of the Terms in Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pharmacy, Practice of Physic, Surgery, Materia Medica, Midwifery, and the Various Branches of Natural Philosophy Connected with Medicine''. Philadelphia: M. Carey &amp; Son, Benjamin Warner, and Edward Parker. Griggs &amp; Company Printers.&lt;/ref&gt; and was defined as "the study of the generation of man". The term was popularized by [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834–1919), a German [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], in his groundbreaking books, ''Natural History of Creation''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1868) ''The History of Creation''. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschicht'') (1868) and ''The Evolution of Man''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1897) ''The Evolution of Man: A Popular Exposition of the Principal Points of Human Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', Volumes 1 and 2. English Translation. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Anthropogenie'') (1874). Haeckel was one of the first biologists to publish on [[evolution]]. Haeckel used the term Anthropogeny to refer to the study of comparative embryology and defined it as "the history of the evolution of man". The term changed over time, however, and came to refer to the study of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason |first1=Otis T.|authorlink=Otis T. Mason|year=1880|title=Sketch of North American Anthropology in 1879|url=|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|volume=14|issue=5|pages=348–356|doi=10.1086/272557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last use of the word ''anthropogeny'' in English literature was in 1933 by [[William K. Gregory]].&lt;ref name="gregory" /&gt; There was a gap in the usage of the term from 1933 to 2008. Anthropogeny was reintroduced in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varki|first1=Ajit|authorlink=Ajit Varki|authorlink2=Daniel Geschwind|authorlink3=Evan Eichler|last2=Geschwind|first2=Daniel|last3=Eichler|first3=Evan|year=2008|title = Explaining human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture|url=|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|volume=9|issue=10|pages=749–763|doi=10.1038/nrg2428|pmc=2756412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now back in academic use at the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Anthropogeny vs. anthropology==
{{disputed section|date=June 2018|reason=Seems to be using words incorrectly and making incorrect intepretations from the evidence.}} 
The root in ancient Greek ''[[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|anthropos]]'' means human and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' means discourse or study, and ''[[wiktionary:-genesis]]'' means the process of creation or origin.
''Anthropology'', therefore, is quite literally the study of humans, whereas ''anthropogeny'' is the breakdown of the word anthropos agai but with the link word -geny (γένη, γένος) which again literally means the study of the birth and gender of humans.

According to the ancient Greeks who came up with the terms, anthropology is the sum of many sciences relating to the human study. There is social, economic, civil and comparative anthropology.

Anthropogony derives from the word 'anthropo' again and -gony (γόνοι), meaning 'the causing of, the birth of', both in a literal and metaphorical sense, referring to what caused by human born or/and conceived/created.

Anthropogeny on the other, is whatever derives from humans. -geny ('γένης᾽), meaning 'the born' or who is born of, but also the gender.

According to Gregory (1933), anthropologists are interested in measuring and quantifying aspects of being human, whereas anthropogenists are interested in "piecing together the broken story of the 'big parade' that nature has staged across the ages".&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=William K.|year=1985|title=The New Anthropogeny: Twenty-Five Stages of Vertebrate Evolution From Silurian Chordate to Man|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=77|pages=29–40|doi=10.1126/science.77.1985.29|pmid=17792389}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of the words, Gregory's statement is wrong.

So anthropology is the study of humans and anthropogeny, is the study of what humans 'gave birth to', to its core definition, although there have been many confusions by those who do not really have an understanding of the word's origins.

Modern anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[archaeology]]. The field of anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]].

The field of anthropogeny is also influenced by the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, however, given that it is the study of the origin of humans, it is also influenced by fields ranging from [[anatomy]] and [[biomechanics]] to [[neurology]] and [[genetics]].

A comprehensive list of Domains of Scientific Discipline relevant to anthropogeny can be found in the [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca/ Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA)], associated with the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA), at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

'''''Boy Wonder''''' is a novel by [[James Robert Baker]] published in 1988. The novel is a mock of oral history of Los Angeles, California in which we hear the life of Hollywood [[avant-garde]] film producer Shark Trager.

==Plot==

Orange County, California 1950: GALE 'SHARK' TRAGER is born to long-suffering WINNIE TRAGER in the backseat of her car at a drive-in.  Shark's arch-conservative father MAC TRAGER (who looks uncannily like actor Glenn Ford) learns the news and ends up running someone off the road on his way to the hospital.  Shark immediately is a strange kid, suffering from childhood obesity and not helped by the fact that Winnie is a hypochondriac and Mac is a racist bully.  When Winnie grows catatonic, Mac brings in sexy GLADYS FRAZER to take over the wife/mother role in the family.  Shark grows up, making friends with gay neighbor KENNY ROBERTS, acne-ridden misfit PUS JENKINS and intellect ELLIOT BERNSTEIN. Winnie dies after climbing into an active freezer and Gladys leaves Mac soon after as the neighbors shun her for being a homewrecker.

As Shark grows up, he falls in love with the movies—his only escape from the bleakness of his own sad childhood—and he becomes an insatiable cinemaphile. Mac's sister LORNA moves in to help Mac raise Shark, but spends her nights fending off Mac's lonely drunken advances. In high school, Shark loses his baby fat and matures into a rakishly handsome young man who strongly resembles Errol Flynn. One day while working at his father's gas station, Shark notices beautiful blonde California teen KATHY PETRO for the first time and he's instantly smitten with her. Kathy is the daughter of powerful local oil magnate JACK PETRO, but everyone at school frowns upon Shark, so Kathy doesn’t give him the time of day. Obsessed with Kathy, Shark takes a movie camera over to her house one night and films her from outside her bathroom window as she masturbates. When Shark tries to get the film developed, he's arrested and Kathy's parents soon learn what a pervert Shark is. Mac freaks out, taking away all of Shark's film equipment as punishment. Shark's relationship with his father only worsens after Shark starts dating an adorable Japanese girl named JUDY OSHIMA. When Mac orders Shark to drop his pants for a VD 'drip check,' Shark accuses the old man of being a homo; Mac is thunderstruck by this accusation—possibly because it's true? Another incident occurs when Kathy Petro makes out with a boy in the local movie theater and Shark, sitting jealously in the seat behind, accosts them. Unfortunately, Shark's girlfriend Judy dies when her moped is struck on the highway. Shark soon gains another friend, easy-going WOODY HAZZARD, a local surfer and small-time drug dealer whom Shark moves in with.

One day Kathy Petro shows up, trying to buy some acid for her boyfriend, JEFF STUBEN; she gets it, but when Jeff has a bad trip and accidentally cuts his own head off with a chainsaw, the cops storm Shark and Woody's place. Shark swallows all the acid and has a bad trip himself in jail. Shark decides to go to film school at UCLA and meets the sensitive and talented NEAL RIDGES, as well as sophisticated SIMONE GATANE. Shark moves into James Dean's old house in the valley and he and Simone start hooking up as he makes his maiden film, "PILLOW FUCK", a wry deconstruction of those insipid 1960s Rock Hudson/Doris Day romantic-comedies. The film is notoriously good and Shark's personal hero, famous French director JEAN-CLAUDE CITROEN, shows up for a screening. Unfortunately Citroen utterly trashes the film afterward and Shark is so devastated that he takes off and burns the only print. Soon after, Shark is living with a gung-ho nut named DRAKE BREWSTER who helps Shark lose weight again and get a security job in Santa Barbara. Shark gets a hold of a graduate student's screenplay and contacts fellow UCLA film student, SUE SCHLOCKMANN, whose father is a low-budget film distributor in Hollywood. Shark pumps up his relationship with Sue and gets her father to give him a producing deal. To everyone's surprise, "SEX KILL A GO-GO" is a huge success. When the draft board calls Shark in, he forces himself to ejaculate on the guy in line in front of him to get out of the draft. When Sue notices Shark's infatuation with Kathy Petro, she tries to distance herself from him, but Shark proposes and the two get married instead. Elliot Bernstein, who originally dated Sue and still loves her, is devastated.

Shark next does "REDNECK SCUM", but when he learns Kathy Petro has gone to France as a model and has started dating Jean-Claude Citroen, he decides to make the movie about them. Shark's obsession with Kathy gets the best of him and he starts dating a fifteen-year-old Lolita-esque Kathy lookalike named CINDY, whom he takes to Cannes along with his latest movie, a murderous lovers-on-the-run art film entitled "WHITE DESERT." Jean-Claude uses his power to get Shark's movie banned from competition, but a late night screening wins over the hearts of the viewers and it becomes a success. Unfortunately, Jean-Claude picks up Cindy and Shark tracks him down on the beach and beats the hell out of him. Shark returns to America only to find Sue's father, angry at Shark's abuse of his daughter, has slipped in some contractual wording and Shark now owes him $6 million. Luckily for Shark, another rival studio buys the pic and Shark's production deal away. Shark makes another movie with a Kathy Petro look-alike in the lead role, an "EXORCIST"-esque thriller called "THE CONDOIST." Kathy does her own movie, however, a small art house romantic-comedy—and winds up getting critically panned for her vapid, amateurish performance; Shark sends her an apologetic note. Soon after, Kathy starts dating BETH, a militant lesbian, and Shark makes yet another movie, this time about Kathy and Beth's relationship—a lesbian variation on "THE SEARCHERS" which Shark calls "SCAR." Beth's father, however, is a powerful guy in Hollywood and he gets the movie pulled. Unfortunately, Beth's father dies when Beth angrily confronts him, and Shark continues unabated. It's then that Shark meets CAROL VAN DER HOF, a charming socialite with a club foot. Shark ends up partnering with Carol and the two form the perfect personal and professional relationship. Hollywood loves them, although Carol is secretly enamored with Shark. Their next flick, a mod late-60s film entitled "MONDO JET SET," is a huge success. Simultaneously, Woody starts having an affair with Kathy, trying his best to keep it a secret from Shark. Kathy's in love for the first time, but everything changes when Woody starts dating a gay film exec named BRIAN STRAIGHT. Brian hates Shark and when Shark messes with Woody, Brian proposes to Kathy in order to help both their careers. Shark explodes when he learns of this, and he storms over to their house and beats the hell out of Brian.

Shark decides to make a movie out of a tragedy that happened in his neighborhood when childhood friend Pus Jenkins murdered a number of local teens. He spends millions on the first scene (an uninterrupted, twenty-minute long shot) and has to blackmail the studio boss with a sex film of his wife in order to keep the movie alive. In the end, Shark comes under fire for hiring Pus himself to play the father of one of the murdered teens. Even worse, Shark starts an affair with Carol, but when he spurns her, she goes on set and cuts off her own club foot. In the climactic scene where the house explodes (they’re filming at Shark's childhood home), Shark races up and dives into the freezer his mother died in just as the bombs go off. Shark survives, but afterward is stabbed by a family member of one of the films’ victims. The studio tries to shelve the film, entitled "RED SURF," but Shark spends all his millions to buy it back. Unfortunately, it's unreleasable and becomes Shark's own "HEAVEN'S GATE", effectively destroying his career.

Afterward, Shark falls into drugs and soon becomes homeless. A theater worker, TODD JARRETT, hires Shark to be his projectionist because of his film knowledge, but another incident with Kathy Petro gets him fired. Soon, Shark is a genuine bum down on Venice Beach and all those who once hailed him, now ignore him. One day, however, Woody, Elliot and Carol are having lunch and spot Shark getting beaten up by some black bums. Woody and Elliot rescue Shark and send him to a Nevada detox unit, which just happens to be run by his ex-roommate, Drake Brewster. Even worse, Kathy Petro, in a downward spiral of sleeping pills, has ended up there too. To their own surprise, the long-simmering heat between them finally explodes and the two end up making love. At the same time, Shark is having an affair with another patient, NARGES PAHLAVI-BARDAHL, an Iranian sheik's daughter. Narges promises to bankroll Shark's next film. Shark is back and producing a science-fiction film entitled "BLUE LIGHT," a movie no one thinks will work. He takes all his old compadres, even his father Mac, to Beirut to film. An incident involving his father and Drake Brewster culminates in Muslim fanatics almost killing them, but Shark proves to be a brave man when he bluffs being wired with explosives and talks his way out of danger. The movie becomes the highest-grossing film of all time and Shark returns to the top of Hollywood, but his fascination with Kathy Petro has driven Narges into drug dependency.

One day, Shark gets a call from the White House: RONALD REAGAN wants to meet him. Shark goes, not knowing Kathy is there at the same time to meet NANCY REAGAN and discuss her biography. Shark and Kathy end up making love in the Roosevelt room, but an unfortunate situation develops when a famous movie star donkey comes through the White House and the animal goes wild, nearly having sex with Kathy. Shark saves her from that fate. Shark and Kathy begin dating, but to Shark's sad surprise, the reality of achieving his life's desire doesn’t live up to the fantasy. Soon Shark writes a touching love story and offers Kathy the lead role. He plays upon her real-life tragedies to get her to cry on demand and the movie, "HOME TO THE HEART", is an emotional masterpiece. But Shark's enemies are too many and just after the movie is nominated for all kinds of Academy Awards, rumors of Shark's transgressions, true and false, come out. Shark becomes reviled. Even worse, the White House story comes out and Kathy is made to look like she had sex with the donkey.

Shark is slowly losing his mind and when the Academy Awards come around, he and Kathy attend, but they get booed quite a lot. Shark runs into Jean-Claude Citroen in the bathroom and attacks him, and we learn Jean-Claude regrets trashing Shark's first film: turns out he actually considered it a masterpiece but was too frightened by its power to tell Shark the truth. Afterward, Kathy wins for Best Actress and thanks Shark in her acceptance speech, but when a weaker film wins for Best Picture, Shark freaks out and nearly sodomizes his director with the Oscar he believes is rightfully his. Shark and Kathy flee the Awards, but when she puts up a fight in his car, Shark pushes her out onto the freeway. Believing she's dead, a distraught Shark drives back to the theater where he once worked to grab a film canister. The cops are after him. Shark speeds back to the exact spot where he was born, now a movieplex, and drives his car through the wall, killing a bunch of neo-Nazi kids. Unfortunately, cops arrive and shoot Shark dead. Shark is portrayed as a child killer in the media and his legacy is destroyed. Only Woody, Simone and Elliot show up for his funeral. Afterward, Kathy is given the film canister Shark tried to retrieve... and she cries when she sees it's footage of her on the beach when she was fourteen years old, something a young, lovestruck Shark filmed from afar...

'''bya''' or '''b.y.a.''' is an [[abbreviation]] for "'''[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years ago'''". It is commonly used as a [[unit of time]] to denote length of time before the present in 10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt; years. This [[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]] is often used in the sciences of [[astronomy]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]].

The "billion" in bya is the 10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt; "billion" of the [[Long and short scales|short scale]] of the [[United States|U.S.]],&lt;ref name="Gale2009"&gt;Gale, Joseph (2009). ''Astrobiology of Earth: The Emergence''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=64zn0nxDVUYC&amp;pg=PA21 21.]&lt;/ref&gt; not the long-scale 10&lt;SUP&gt;12&lt;/SUP&gt; "billion" of some [[Europe]]an usage. Billion by this convention (10&lt;SUP&gt;9&lt;/SUP&gt;) is often called a "thousand million" in the UK and a "milliard" in some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, Mark (2004). ''Satellite Communications for the Nonspecialist''. New York: SPIE Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MM0d2cMUWbEC&amp;pg=PA73 73.]&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, there is potential for some confusion, and some scientists prefer the unit [[Gya]], while others prefer [[Giga-annum|Ga]] (Giga-annum), however bya remains in more widespread use.&lt;ref name="Gale2009"/&gt; In 1974, the UK switched from the long scale to the short scale.&lt;ref name="Gale2009"/&gt;

Related units are [[Mya (unit)|mya]] ("million years ago"), and '''byr''' ("billion years"). These are traditionally written in [[lowercase]].  [[Giga-annum|Ga]] or Gya has a [[capitalization|capitalized]] first letter instead.

In February 1981, the Commission concluded that the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II]] was a "grave injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartime Internment of Japanese was 'Grave Injustice,' Panel Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/25/us/wartime-internment-of-japanese-was-grave-injustice-panel-says.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1981, the Commission held public hearings in Washington, D.C. to hear testimony from Japanese-American and Alaska Native witnesses. Public hearings followed in other American cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, Cambridge, New York City, Anchorage, the Aleutian Islands, Pribilof Islands (St. Paul), Chicago, and Los Angeles, where the testimonies were recorded.&lt;ref name=DenshoEncyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redress Hearings Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) Hearings (1981)|url=http://www.ncrr-la.org/NCRR_archives/redresshearings81/redresshearings.htm|website=Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 750 people testified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internment History Timeline|work=Children of the Camps |url=https://www.pbs.org/childofcamp/history/timeline.html|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, the CWRIC issued its findings in ''Personal Justice Denied'', concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. Rather, the report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on "racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Justice Denied|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/japanese-americans/justice-denied/|work=Personal Justice Denied|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lastly, the Commission recommended legislative remedies: an official [[Federal Government of the United States|Government]] apology and redress payments to survivors. Congress passed legislation and on August 10, 1988, the [[Civil Liberties Act of 1988]] was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 100-383 -- August 10, 1988|url=http://www.internmentarchives.com/showdoc.php?docid=00172&amp;search_id=44801|website=Internment Archives|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act's purposes included the government's acknowledging and apologizing for the injustice of the evacuation and internment of US citizens and long-term residents; creating a public education fund to inform the public; making restitution to parties affected; discouraging a similar event from happening in the future; and demonstrating the U.S.' consideration of human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text of the Civil Liberties Act of 1987|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/100/hr442/text|website=GovTrack|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this act and a related one in 1992, the US government paid reparations to more than 82,200 Japanese Americans.

The '''consequences of the Black Death''' are the short-term and long-term effects of the [[Black Death]] on human populations across the world. They include a series of various biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially [[History of Europe|European history]]. Often referred to as simply "The Plague", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Eurasia between 1331 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 450&amp;nbsp;million to between 350 and 375&amp;nbsp;million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.

From the perspective of many of the survivors, however, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labor was suddenly in higher demand. R.H. Hilton has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Hanawalt, "Centuries of Transition: England in the Later Middle Ages," in Richard Schlatter, ed., ''Recent Views on British History: Essays on Historical Writing since 1966'' (Rutgers UP, 1984), pp 43–44, 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reference"&gt;R.H.

==Death toll==
{{See also|Medieval demography}}

Figures for the [[infectious disease#Historic pandemics|death toll]] vary widely by area and from source to source, and estimates are frequently revised as historical research brings new discoveries to light. Most scholars estimate that the Black Death killed between 75 and 200 million people in the 14th century, at a time when the entire world population was still less than 500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |first=Will |last=Dunham |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1576875.stm |title=De-coding the Black Death |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kristen |last=Philipkoski |url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/10/47288 |title=Black Death's Gene Code Cracked |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=3 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where the historical record is considered reliable, only rough estimates of the total number of deaths from the plague are possible.

===Europe===

Europe suffered an especially significant death toll from the plague. Modern estimates range between roughly one-third and one-half of the total European population in the five-year period of 1347 to 1351, during which the most severely affected areas may have lost up to 80 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;"The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45% to 50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe and Italy, the South of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75% to 80% of the population. In Germany and England, it was probably closer to 20%." [[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-59803-345-8}}.
Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n° 310, June 2006, pp.45–46, say "between one-third and two-thirds"; Robert Gottfried (1983). "Black Death" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', volume 2, pp.257–67, says "between 25 and 45&amp;nbsp;percent".
Daileader, as above; Barry and Gualde, as above, Gottfried, as above. 
Norwegian historian Ole J. Benedictow ('The Black Death: The Greatest Catastrophe Ever', ''History Today'', Volume 55 Issue 3 March 2005 (http://www.historytoday.com/ole-j-benedictow/black-death-greatest-catastrophe-ever); cf. Benedictow, ''The Black Death 1346–1353: The Complete History'', Boydell Press (7 Dec. 2012), pp. 380ff.) suggests a death rate as high as 60%, or 50 million out of 80 million inhabitants.&lt;/ref&gt;
Contemporary chronicler [[Jean Froissart]], incidentally, estimated the toll to be one-third, which modern scholars consider less an accurate assessment than an allusion to the [[Book of Revelation]] meant to suggest the scope of the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Froissart, ''Chronicles'' (trans. Geoffrey Brereton, Penguin, 1968, corrections 1974), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths were not evenly distributed across Europe, with some areas affected very little while others were all but entirely depopulated.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). ''The Black Death''. {{ISBN|0-313-32492-1}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Death hit the culture of towns and cities disproportionately hard, although rural areas (where most of the population lived at the time) were also significantly affected. Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier. Cities were also strikingly filthy, infested with [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, and [[rat]]s, and subject to diseases caused by malnutrition and poor [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Kelly (2005), "[w]oefully inadequate sanitation made medieval urban Europe so disease-ridden, no city of any size could maintain its population without a constant influx of immigrants from the countryside". The influx of new citizens facilitated the movement of the plague between communities and contributed to the longevity of the plague within larger communities. Kelly, John. ''The Great Mortality, an Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time''. NY: HarperCollins, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence]]'s population was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 to 50,000 in 1351. Between 60 and 70 percent of [[Hamburg]]'s and [[Bremen]]'s populations died. In [[Provence]], [[Dauphiné]], and [[Normandy]], historians observe a decrease of 60 percent of fiscal hearths. In some regions, two-thirds of the population was annihilated. In the town of [[Givry, Saône-et-Loire|Givry]], in the [[Bourgogne]] region of France, the local friar, who used to note 28 to 29 funerals a year, recorded 649 deaths in 1348, half of them in September. About half of [[Perpignan]]'s population died over the course of several months (only two of the eight physicians survived the plague). Over 60 percent of Norway's population died between 1348 and 1350.&lt;ref name = "Forskning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/juli/1090833676.68 |title=Svartedauden Enda verre enn antatt |publisher=Forskning.no |author=Harald Aastorp |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London]] may have lost two-thirds of its population during the 1348–49 outbreak;&lt;ref name=guardian811&gt;{{cite news | URL = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/black-death-rats-off-hook | title = Black Death study lets rats off the hook | last = Kennedy | first = Maev |date = 17 August 2011 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England as a whole may have lost 70 percent of its population, which declined from 7&amp;nbsp;million before the plague to 2&amp;nbsp;million in 1400.&lt;ref&gt;Barry and Gualde 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A few rural areas, especially in [[Kingdom of Poland|Eastern Poland]] and [[Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], had such low populations and were so isolated that the plague made little progress there. Other places, including parts of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] region, [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and [[Limbourg]] (in modern Belgium), as well as [[Santiago de Compostela]], were unaffected for unknown reasons. Some historians&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, "The Smallest Thing  of History" (''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'', in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°310, June 2006, pp.45–46&lt;/ref&gt; have assumed that the presence of resistant [[blood group]]s in the local population helped them resist infection, although these regions were touched by the second plague outbreak in 1360–63 (the "little mortality") and later during the numerous resurgences of the plague (in 1366–69, 1374–75, 1400, 1407, etc.). Other areas which escaped the plague were isolated in mountainous regions (e.g. the [[Pyrenees]]).

All social classes were affected, although the lower classes, living together in unhealthy places, were most vulnerable. [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] was the only European monarch to die of the plague, but [[Peter IV of Aragon]] lost [[Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon|his wife]], his daughter, and a niece in six months. [[Joan of England (1335–1348)|Joan of England]], daughter of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], died in [[Bordeaux]] on her way to Castile to marry Alfonso's son, [[Peter of Castile|Pedro]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] lost his son, while in the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]], [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of Navarre]], daughter of [[Louis X of France|Louis X ''le Hutin'']] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]], was killed by the plague, as well as [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bonne of Luxembourg]], the wife of the future [[John II of France]].

===Asia===

Estimates of the demographic effect of the plague in Asia are based on population figures during this time and estimates of the disease's toll on population centers. The most severe outbreak of plague in the Chinese province of [[Hubei]] in 1334 claimed up to 80 percent of the population.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} China had several [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] and [[famine]]s from 1200 to the 1350s and its population decreased from an estimated 125&amp;nbsp;million to 65&amp;nbsp;million in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joseph J. |last=Spengler |jstor=177771 |title=Review (''Studies on the Population of China, 1368–1953'' by Ping-Ti Ho) |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |date=October 1962 |volume=5 |pages=112–114 |issue=1 |doi=10.1017/s0010417500001547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-02/919734037.Mi.r.html |title=Re: How many people recovered from Black Death (Bubonic Plague) |publisher=MadSci Network |date=22 February 1999 |first=Michael |last=Maguire |at=ID: 918741314.Mi |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Asia-Tsunami/Worlds-long-dance-with-death/2005/01/07/1104832310525.html |title=World's long dance with death |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |first=Jonathan |last=King |date= 2005-01-08|accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise demographic effect of the disease in the [[Middle East]] is very difficult to calculate. Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. Syria lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.

==Social, environmental, and economic effects==

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.&lt;ref name=Bennett-329&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M. Bennett |author2 =C. Warren Hollister |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |page=329 |isbn=0-07-295515-5 |oclc=56615921}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one in the 14th century considered rat control a way to ward off the plague, and people began to believe only God's anger could produce such horrific displays of suffering and death. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an Italian writer and poet of the era, questioned whether it was sent by God for their correction, or that it came through the influence of the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.vt.edu/Burr/Sources.html|title=Boccaccio on the Plague|last=Boccaccio|first=Giovanni|date=|website=Virginia Tech|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians accused Jews of poisoning public water supplies in an effort to ruin European civilization. The spreading of this rumor led to complete destruction of entire Jewish towns, and was simply caused by suspicion on part of the Christians, who noticed that the Jews had lost fewer lives to the plague due to their hygienic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newhhealthguide.org/Where-Did-The-Black-Death-Start|title=Where Did the Black Death Start|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in [[Strasbourg]]. In August of the same year, the Jewish communities of [[Mainz]] and [[Cologne]] were exterminated.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, 329–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where government authorities were concerned, most [[monarchy|monarchs]] instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned [[underground economy|black market]] [[speculators]], set [[price controls]] on grain, and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.

Europe had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.yahoo.com/the-devastating-impact-black-death-marriage-376886.html?cat=9&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–293 &amp; 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348–49.&lt;ref name=guardian811/&gt; However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.

===Effect on the peasantry===

The great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.&lt;ref name="reference" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Hanawalt, "centuries of Transition: England in the Later Middle Ages," in Richard Schlatter, ed., ''Recent Views on British History: Essays on Historical Writing since 1966'' (Rutgers UP, 1984), pp 43–44, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eastern Europe]], by contrast, renewed stringency of laws tied the remaining peasant population more tightly to the land than ever before through [[serfdom]]. Sparsely populated Eastern Europe was less affected by the Black Death and so peasant revolts were less common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, not occurring in the east until the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries.

Furthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.&lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].

The rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died, leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Effect on urban workers===

In the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers. Local and royal authorities in Western Europe instituted wage controls.&lt;ref name=penn-356-357&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penn|first1=Simon A. C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Christopher|title=Wages and Earnings in Late Medieval England: Evidence from the Enforcement of the Labour Laws|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=356–357|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1990.tb00535.x|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; These governmental controls sought to  freeze wages at the old levels before the Black Death.&lt;ref name=penn-356-357/&gt; Within England, for example, the [[Ordinance of Labourers]], enacted in 1349, and the [[Statute of Labourers]], enacted in 1351, restricted both wage increases and the relocation of workers.&lt;ref name=penn-356-357/&gt; If workers attempted to leave their current post, employers were given the right to have them imprisoned. The Statute was poorly enforced in most areas, and farm wages in England on average doubled between 1350 and 1450,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Clark, "The long march of history: Farm wages, population, and economic growth, England 1209–1869," ''Economic History Review''  60.1 (2007): 97–135. [http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/31320/1/50512257X.pdf online], page 36&lt;/ref&gt; although they were static thereafter until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munro|first1=John H. A.|title=Before and After the Black Death: Money, Prices, and Wages in Fourteenth-Century England|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/tor/tecipa/munro-04-04.html|website=ideas.repec.org|accessdate=5 August 2014|date=5 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohn, comparing numerous countries, argues that these laws were not primarily designed to freeze  wages. Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom. Cohn says the laws reflect the anxiety that followed the Black Death's new horrors of mass mortality and destruction, and from elite anxiety about manifestations such as the flagellant movement and the persecution of Jews, Catalans, and beggars.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Cohn, "After the Black Death: Labour Legislation and Attitudes Towards Labour in Late-Medieval Western Europe," ''Economic History Review'' (2007) 60#3 pp. 457–485 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502106 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour-saving innovation===
By 1200, virtually all of the Mediterranean basin and most of northern Germany had been deforested and cultivated. Indigenous flora and fauna were replaced by domestic grasses and animals and domestic woodlands were lost. With depopulation, this process was reversed. Much of the primeval vegetation returned, and abandoned fields and pastures were reforested.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

The Black Death encouraged innovation of labour-saving technologies, leading to higher productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plagued by dear labour|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/economic-history-1|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=5 August 2014|location=London|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a shift from grain farming to animal husbandry. Grain farming was very labor-intensive, but animal husbandry needed only a shepherd and a few dogs and pastureland.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

Plague brought an eventual end of Serfdom in Western Europe. The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500. Severe depopulation and migration of the village to cities caused an acute shortage of agricultural labourers. Many villages were abandoned. In England, more than 1300 villages were deserted between 1350 and 1500.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottfried|first=Robert S.|title=The black death: natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe|year=1983|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-912630-4 |edition=1. Free Press paperback|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wages of labourers were high, but the rise in nominal wages following the Black Death was swamped by post-Plague inflation, so that real wages fell.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

Labor was in such a short supply that Lords were forced to give better terms of tenure. This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

There was change in the inheritance law. Before the plague, only sons and especially the elder son inherited the ancestral property. Post plague all sons as well as daughters started inheriting property.&lt;ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/&gt;

===Persecutions===
{{See also|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}

Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism came in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted "groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims",&lt;ref name=nirenberg&gt;David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lepers&lt;ref name=nirenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 {{ISBN|0-631-17145-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romani people|Romani]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis.

Differences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], in part because better hygiene among Jewish communities and isolation in the ghettos meant that Jews were less affected.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman ''A Concise History Of The Jewish People'' 2005 – Page 154 "However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'. Consequently, when the rat and the flea brought the Black Death, Jews, with better hygiene, suffered less severely ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P Byrne, ''Encyclopedia of the Black Death'' Volume 1 2012 – Page 15 "Anti–Semitism and Anti–Jewish Violence before the Black Death ... Their attention to personal hygiene and diet, their forms of worship, and cycles of holidays were off-puttingly different."&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations spread that Jews had caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe After the Black Death'' 2000 Page 146 "There were several reasons for this, including, it has been suggested, the observance of laws of hygiene tied to ritual practices and a lower incidence of alcoholism and venereal disease"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 Page 763 "Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge. In areas where Jews appeared to die of the plague in fewer numbers than Christians, possibly because of better hygiene and greater isolation, lower mortality rates provided evidence of Jewish guilt."&lt;/ref&gt; European mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred.

According to Joseph P. Byrne, women also faced persecution during the Black Death. Muslim women in [[Cairo]] became scapegoats when the plague struck.&lt;ref name=byrne&gt;Joseph P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when "the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food."&lt;ref name=byrne/&gt;

===Religion===

The Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Epstein, ''An Economic and Social History of Later Medieval Europe, 1000–1500'' (2009) p 182&lt;/ref&gt;  The shortage of priests opened new opportunities for laywomen to assume more extensive and more important service roles in the local parish.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine L. French, ''The Good Women of the Parish: Gender and Religion After the Black Death'' (U of Pennsylvania Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flagellants.png|thumb|Woodcut of flagellants ([[Nuremberg Chronicle]], 1493)]]
[[Flagellants]] practiced self-flogging (whipping of oneself) to atone for sins. The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.

Reformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, p 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effect==
{{Main|Black Death in medieval culture}}
[[File:Trionfo della morte, già a palazzo sclafani, galleria regionale di Palazzo Abbatellis, palermo (1446) , affresco staccato.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Triumph of Death (Palermo)|The Triumph of Death]]'' (1446)]]

The Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the "dance of death" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from  writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peire Lunel de Montech]], writing about 1348 in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, composed the following sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' "Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]]:

{{quote|They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. And I, [[Agnolo di Tura]] ... buried my five children with my own hands ... And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~afutrell/w%20civ%2002/plaguereadings.html |title=Plague readings |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boccaccio wrote:

{{quote|How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ship's hold and covered with a little earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spignesi |first1=Stephen |title=Catastrophe!: The 100 Greatest Disasters Of All Time |date=2002 |publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp |location=New York |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

===Medicine===

Although the Black Death highlighted the shortcomings of medical science in the medieval era, it also led to positive changes in the field of medicine. As described by David Herlihy in ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West,'' more emphasis was placed on “anatomical investigations” following the Black Death.&lt;ref name=herlihy&gt;David Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; How individuals studied the human body notably changed, becoming a process that dealt more directly with the human body in varied states of sickness and health. Further, at this time, the importance of surgeons became more evident.&lt;ref name=herlihy/&gt;

A theory put forth by Stephen O'Brien says the Black Death is likely responsible, through [[natural selection]], for the high frequency of the [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] genetic defect in people of European descent. The gene affects [[T cell]] function and provides protection against [[HIV]], [[smallpox]], and possibly plague,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Jefferys | first1= Richard | author2= Anne-christine d'Adesky | title = Designer Genes | journal = [[LPI Media#HIV Plus|HIV Plus]] | date=March 1999 | url = http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |issn=1522-3086 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214110211/http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html |archivedate=14 February 2008 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though for the last, no explanation as to how it would do that exists. This, however, is now challenged, given that the CCR5-Δ32 gene has been found to be just as common in [[Bronze Age]] tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Ground truth' for selection on CCR5-Δ32 |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |date=June 2006 |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=293–6 |author1=Philip W. Hedrick |author2=Brian C. Verrelli |pmid=16678299 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===

The Black Death also inspired European architecture to move in two different directions: (1) a revival of Greco-Roman styles, and (2) a further elaboration of the [[Gothic style]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Late medieval churches had impressive structures centred on verticality, where one's eye is drawn up towards the high ceiling. The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature. Images of intense sorrow, decaying corpses, and individuals with faults as well as virtues emerged. North of the Alps, painting reached a pinnacle of precise realism with [[Early Dutch painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390– by 1441). The natural world was reproduced in these works with meticulous detail whose realism was not unlike photography.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Hollister, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''From Atlantis to the Sphinx''''' is a work of non-fiction by British author, [[Colin Wilson]], with the subheading  ''Recovering the Lost Wisdom of the Ancient World''.

Wilson proposes in the text that the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] was constructed by a technologically advanced people "nearly 10,000 years before [[Egyptologists]] have hypothesized" by the same people who provided plans for the construction of the pyramids of Egypt, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Central]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67741948.html|title = Book Thickens the Riddle of the Sphinx|last = Graham|first = Mark|date = 6 November 1997|work = [[Rocky Mt. News|Rocky Mountain News]]|access-date = 2015-08-02|via = [[Highbeam Research]]|location = Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book explores the connection between [[astronomy]] and [[mythology]], arguing that ancient man used "Lunar knowledge" (intuition) as opposed to modern man's "Solar knowledge" (logic) to interpret the universe and therefore possessed an entirely different but equally valid mentality from that of modern man. Wilson proposes that the outlook of ancient man was based on "seeing the big picture" rather than logically breaking down the universe into its constituent parts.

Wilson develops this idea of civilisations founded on Lunar Knowledge together with astronomy to explain the monumental and seemingly spontaneous achievements of ancient cultures such as the [[Pyramids of Giza|Pyramid Complex]] at [[Giza]] in Egypt.

Wilson argues that the essential weakness of [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' is that Frazer attributed the fundamental mythological systems to the beginnings of the farming cultures, specifically to fertility. Agreeing with [[Giorgio de Santillana]]'s thesis developed in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'', Wilson places the genesis of mythology previous to fertility cultures, linking the fundamental myths to astronomical occurrences such as the [[Precession of the Equinoxes]].

The main observations drawn by Wilson are that our ancient pre-''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ancestors possessed intelligence equal to that of modern man, their apparent lack of technological achievement being explained by the needlessness of it based on their completely different, intuitive and all-embracing mentality. Over time, a more logical and dissecting mentality evolved leading to the traits which mark modern civilisations.

'''Historic paint analysis''' is the [[scientific analysis]] of [[architectural coatings|architectural finishes]], including not only [[paint]]s but also metallic finishes and clear and translucent finishes used on historic [[building]]s. The primary purpose of such analysis is to determine the color of the finish used at a particular time in the building's history, usually the original construction, but not always. Secondary purposes include determination of ingredients such as media ([[water]], [[oil]], [[latex]], etc.) and [[pigments]] (organic pigments, inorganic pigments, [[dyes]], etc.). Paint analysis is also used at times as a dating technique for various building elements.

Typical problems encountered in historic paint analysis include such things as paint loss, surface deterioration, newer materials, substrates, delamination, media and pigment deterioration, and alligatoring.

==History==
Historic [[architectural]] paint analysis finds its roots in the early twentieth century in the United States. The historic preservation movement began in 1849 with the preservation of [[Mount Vernon]], the home of [[George Washington]].  Early [[preservationist]]s began to realize that paints and finishes which had survived were very important but may not have been the original, or historic, finishes.  Interest in historic wallpapers also developed with the interest in historic paint and color. One of the earliest endeavors came with the restoration of [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] funded by [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1920s. Early investigations by simple scraping of the finishes by Susan Nash&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. "Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum". In Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; of the surviving original buildings  yielded a palette that became popularly known as Williamsburg colors. 

In the 1950s and 1960s serious efforts at investigating original paint colors were underway at [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia by architect Penelope Hartshorne Batcheler.  Her pioneering efforts introduced, for the first time in this country, the use of a stereo microscope to more closely examine the 18th century paints at [[Independence Hall]].  Batcheler also introduced the use of the [[Munsell Color System]] for matching and referencing original paint colors.  Her landmark publication, "Paint Color Research and Restoration", was the very first publication concerning the analysis of historic architectural paints for determination of original colors. At the same time, in the [[United Kingdom]], microscopy of paint samples was developed by Joyce Plesters of the [[National Gallery, London]] who worked mainly with easel paintings but also with samples from wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Plesters, 'Cross-sections &amp; Chemical Analysis of Paint Samples', ''Studies in Conservation'', vol. 2, (1956), 110-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and early 1970s [[Morgan W. Phillips]] at the [[Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities]] (SPNEA) became involved with historic paint and color analysis, specifically at the Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. At the same time, E. Blaine Cliver, Historical Architect, who originally worked with Batcheler at the National Park Service (NPS) in Philadelphia, then with the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in Washington, DC and later at the Northeast Regional Office of the NPS, became involved with historic paint analysis, especially in a laboratory in Building 28 of the former [[Boston Navy Yard]]. In the early 1970s, [[Frank S. Welsh]] joined the NPS in Philadelphia and began his research and study of historic paints with Penelope Batcheler, where he introduced the use of the National Bureau of Standards Color Name Charts, ([[NIST]]) for naming the colors matched to the Munsell Color System.  Welsh also was the first to introduce the term "paint analysis" into the lexicon of historic preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Frank S. "Paint &amp; Color Restoration," ''The Old-House Journal'', Vol. 3, No. 8, August, 1975. 1,8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; As an independent historic paint color consultant one of his first major projects was [[Monticello]], the home of [[Thomas Jefferson]].  In the mid 1970s, Matthew J. Mosca started working for the National Trust with Blaine Cliver.  Later, as a preservation consultant, Mosca researched the historic colors of [[Mount Vernon]].

The advances in the science of paint color research by these individuals suggested that the popular Williamsburg colors had been matched to faded and aged finishes. During the 1980s and 1990s [[Colonial Williamsburg]] consulted with Welsh to undertake a comprehensive paint and color analysis on numerous buildings in the historic area.&lt;ref&gt; Taylor, Jr., Thomas H. and Pappas, Nicholas A., "Colonial Williamsburg: A Changing Spectrum," in ''Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Building''s, Roger W. Moss, ed. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his research, "the first modern scientific paint analysis" there, confirmed that the Williamsburg color palette did not represent the actual historic colors.  In addition he found that in many cases their early efforts had mistakenly matched later paint layers, some nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jr.,Thomas H., and Papas, Jr., Nicholas A. 'Colonial Williamsburg Colors: A Changing Spectrum,' in, ''Paint in America: The Colors of Historic Buildings'', Roger W. Moss, ed. (New York, John Wiley, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, paint analysis was done on site by carefully removing later paint layers to reveal a sequence of finishes down to the substrate. This was the methodology employed during the early restoration of finishes at Historic Williamsburg. Although this method is employed by a few practitioners, it is not common because of its inherent problems of misinterpretation and failure to address issues such as paint ageing and discoloration.&lt;ref&gt;see the following paper: Patrick Baty [http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/scrapes.htm “To Scrape or Not to Scrape”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185948/http://www.papers-paints.co.uk/scrapes.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} for the drawbacks of carrying out a scrape.  This was originally published in ''Traditional Paint News'' vol.1, no.2. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Because finishes analysis is performed under laboratory conditions samples are collected in the field for later analysis and can be collected by the analyst or by his client who then ships them to him.

==Laboratory analysis==
The primary purposes of analysis are to determine historic finishes and to determine principle components such as media or basic pigments. There are two methodologies in the preparation of paint samples for microscopic analysis. The first, which is derived from the medical world, is to treat the sample as a specimen and set it into a fixed position in a permanent medium such as [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]]. The specimen is then ground to a flat finish, providing a horizontal surface for viewing under a microscope. The second is to leave the samples in a loose condition with their broken surfaces which then can be manipulated under the microscope to permit a variety of views of the layers. The primary disadvantage to the first method is that the grinding process tends to blur layers together, especially layers of similar or identical colors. It also provide only a single, fixed point of viewing. The second method lacks these disadvantages, although skill and experience is required to manipulate the samples effectively.

Following preparation of the samples, they are typically viewed under an optical microscope using either natural north light or [[Polarized light|polarized artificial light]] simulating natural north light. North light is essential in order to render the colors accurately without the effects of the yellow spectrum of direct sunlight. Each individual layer is identified and, typically, matched to the [[Munsell color system]]. The Munsell color system is a scientific system in which colors have been ranged into a color fan based upon three attributes: [[hue]] or color, the chroma or [[color saturation]], and the value or neutral [[Lightness (color)|lightness]] or darkness. Unlike color systems developed by paint manufacturers, the Munsell system provides an unchanging standard of reference which is unaffected by the marketplace and changing tastes in colors.

The hue notation, the color, indicates the relation of the sample to a visually equally spaced scale of 100 hues. There are 10 major hues, five principal and five intermediate within this scale. The hues are identified by initials indicating the central member of the group: red R, yellow-red YR, yellow Y, yellow-green YG, green G, blue-green BG, blue B, purple-blue PB, purple P, and red-purple PR. The hues in each group are identified by the numbers 1 to 10. The most purplish of the red hues, 1 on the scale of 100, is designated as 1R, the most yellowish as 10R, and the central hue as 5R. The hue 10R can also be expressed as 10, 5Y as 25, and so forth if a notation of the hue as a number is desired. Chroma indicates the degree of departure of a given hue from the neutral gray axis of the same value. It is the strength of saturation of color from neutral gray, written /0 to /14 or further for maximum color saturation.

Value, or lightness, makes up the neutral gray axis of the color wheel, ranging from black, number 1, to white at the top of the axis, number 10. A visual value can be approximated by the help of the neutral gray chips of the Rock or Soil Color chart with ten intervals. The color parameters can be expressed with figures semi-quantitatively as: hue, value/chroma (H, V/C). The color "medium red" should serve as an example for presentation with the three color attributes, 5R 5.5/6. This means that 5R is located in the middle of the red hue, 5.5 is the lightness of Munsell value near the middle between light and dark, and 6 is the degree of the Munsell chroma, or the color saturation, which is about in the middle of the saturation scale.

[[File:Penn Station2.jpg|thumb|[[Demolition]] of the former [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Penn Station]] concourse raised public awareness about preservation]]
&lt;!--the term historic preservation is seemingly almost exclusively found in United States English; other terms are used in other English speaking cultures, though certain non-English phrases may directly transliterate as "Historic Preservation"; as a result of the ambiguous usage of the term, this was chosen as the primary article; other potential meanings are referenced in the hatnote; see discussion pages for details.--&gt;

'''Historic preservation''' (US), '''heritage preservation''' or '''heritage conservation''' (UK), is an endeavour that seeks to preserve, conserve and protect buildings, objects, landscapes or other artifacts of historical significance.
This term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===England===
In [[England]], [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] interests were a familiar gentleman's pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] were often also Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

[[File:Castle Berkhamsted cz.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Berkhamsted from the Norman Castle's Motte|The ruins of Berkhamsted castle (viewed from its Norman motte) and Berkhamsted Common were the location of two successful early preservation events in the nineteenth century. (Enlarged: A train passes Berkhamsted castle, on an embankment that was once part of the castle's outer defences.)]]Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK; including [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity Hospital]] and its church in Edinburgh, [[Furness Abbey]], [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] and [[Northampton Castle]], and the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 [[Berkhamsted Castle]] became the first historic site in England officially protected by statute under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 1833{{ndash}}1837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle's gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south.&lt;ref name="Wheeler1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wheeler|title=Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-cloud of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNxRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4377-2|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early preservation event also occurred at [[Berkhamsted]]. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at [[Ashridge]], tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=on}} steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, [[Common land]] was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been [[enclosure|enclosed]] by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London's East End in [[direct action]] to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.&lt;ref name=Cobb1893p26&gt;{{harvnb|Cobb|1883|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood2006p245&gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|2008|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birtchnell1988psNone&gt;{{harvnb|Birtchnell|1988|ps=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]] (later co-founder of the [[National Trust]] in 1895) and the [[Commons Preservation Society]] succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.&lt;ref name="commons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Shaw-Lefevre on the Preservation of Commons|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 1886|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashbrook |first=Kate |url=http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/more-news/exhibition-and-commemorative-walk-marks-anniversary-of-battle-to-save-berkhamsted-common-1-7006636 | title=Exhibition and commemorative walk marks anniversary of battle to save Berkhamsted Common | publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd. | work=Hemel Gazette | date=12 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Lubbock72.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], MP was a moving force behind the implementation of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882.]]By the mid 19th century, much of [[UK|Britain's]] unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like [[William Greenwell]] excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, [[Stonehenge]] came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the [[London and South-Western Railway]] as the monument was "not the slightest use to anyone now"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country's national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill]] and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[William Gladstone]] of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]]. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]]. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] was founded by the [[Arts and Crafts]] designer [[William Morris]] to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the [[National Trust]] in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Bill. "At Home: A Short History of Private Life" Transworld Publishers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] took this further by empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910|1910]].

[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]], a medieval [[manor house]] had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of [[India]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468|title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house|publisher=BBC News Magazine|author=Denise Winterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle&lt;ref name=Adrian&gt;{{cite book|title=English Castles: A Guide by Counties|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|author=Adrian Pettifer|pages=145–7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term "monument" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Trust====
{{one source section|date=October 2017}}
The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] was founded in 1894 by [[Octavia Hill]], [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley]] as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and [[Tenement (law)|tenements]] (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any description having national and historic or artistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/documents/download-national-trust-acts-1907-1971-post-order-2005.pdf | title=The National Trust Acts  1907 - 1971, as varied by a Parliamentary Scheme implemented by  The Charities (National Trust) Order 2005 | publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] | accessdate=10 November 2017 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]]. Its first archaeological monument was [[White Barrow]]. The focus on [[English country house|country houses]] and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them.

The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] took steps toward historic preservation on an unprecedented scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Concern about the demolition of historic buildings arose in institutions such as the pressure group [[the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings]], which appealed against demolition and neglect on a case by case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphb.org.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-21 |title=The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings (SPHB)|publisher=sphb.org.uk|accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Heritage====
[[English Heritage]] formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Era for English Heritage|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/new-era-for-englands-heritage1|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprises over 400 of England's historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are [[Stonehenge]], [[Dover Castle]], [[Tintagel Castle]] and the best preserved parts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], officially titled the [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]], that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties.&lt;ref name="EH History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the [[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]] and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England's historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: [[Historic England]], which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new [[English Heritage Trust]], a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph EHT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|title=Does our history have a future in the hands of the English Heritage Trust?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11441254/Does-our-history-have-a-future-in-the-hands-of-the-English-Heritage-Trust.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state.

In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the
[[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site]], in [[Newburgh, New York]]. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850.

Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Diane. "America's Preservation Ethos: A Tribute to Enduring Ideals."

[[Charles E. Peterson]] was an influential figure in the mid-20th century establishing the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), advising on the establishment of [[Independence National Historical Park]], helping with the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the United States at [[Columbia University]], and author.

The architectural firm of Simons &amp; Lapham (Albert Simons and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]) was an influential supporter of the nation's first historic preservation ordinance in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]] led to the creation of the Vieux Carré Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, ''Documentation of the Architecture of the Architecture of Samuel Lapham and the Firm of Simons &amp; Lapham'', Masters of Fine Arts in Historic Preservation Thesis, Savannah College of Art &amp; Design, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Scott S.

The US [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], another privately funded [[non-profit organization]], began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide "leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America's diverse historic places and revitalize our communities" according to the Trust's mission statement.  In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, [[Woodlawn Plantation]] in [[northern Virginia]]. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the [[cultural diversity]] of American history.  In New York City, the destruction of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation "from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an international level, the New York-based [[World Monuments Fund]] was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world.

James Marston Fitch also offered guidance and support towards the founding of the Master of Preservation Studies Degree within the Tulane School of Architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.tulane.edu|title=Tulane School of Architecture -|website=architecture.tulane.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.tulane.edu/programs/degrees/mps-master-preservation-studies|title=Master of Preservation Studies|website=Tulane School of Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M.Sc. in Building Conservation degree program is offered by the School of Architecture at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in Troy, New York.

===Canada===
{{Main|Heritage conservation in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the phrase "heritage preservation" is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. "Conservation" is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|central government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organisation for heritage buildings and landscapes.

=== The Netherlands ===
[[Victor de Stuers]] is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/stuersv|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|website=arthistorians.info|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de Stuers was  appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind ''[[Monumentenzorg]]'' (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the ''[[Rijksmuseum]]'' (National Museum) and the ''Rijksarchief'' (National Archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerkindenhaag.nl/agendaberichten/victor-de-stuers-vader-van-monumentenzorg-en-rijksmuseum/|title=Victor de Stuers, vader van Monumentenzorg en Rijksmuseum - Kerk in Den Haag|website=www.kerkindenhaag.nl|language=nl|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/stuers|title=Stuers, jhr.

However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the [[:nl:Monumentenwet|''Monumentenwet'']] (“Monuments Act”) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and “which are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value” and must thus be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/till014sche01_01/till014sche01_01_0031.php|title=J.A.C.

In 1973, the NGO ''Monumentenwacht'' (“Monument Watch”) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/migrated-reports/629_1.pdf|title=Devlin, H. (2005). European initiatives in preventative maintenance for historic buildings.

The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Martin E. |authorlink=Martin E.

A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24|title=Flood Risk Management in Europe|first1=L.M.|last1=Bouwer|first2=P.|last2=Vellinga|date=20 October 2018|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=469–484|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/people/sarah.dromgoole&lt;/ref&gt; shipwrecks from [[Dutch East India Company|The Dutch East India Company]] are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=nuSwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=monumentenwet+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4JlsRABjN&amp;sig=wZoBBeGGK6nlqU1VABsCB6PPbfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrruD1h67XAhWEl5QKHZP_CjsQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=monumentenwet%201961&amp;f=false|title=The Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage: National Perspectives in Light of the UNESCO Convention 2001 - Second Edition|last=Dromgoole|first=Sarah|date=2006-06-30|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047410454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macedonia ===
In Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (Закон за заштита на културното наследство). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/Law%20on%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf “Закон за заштита на културното наследство” (PDF)]. „Сл. Весник на Република Македонија“ бр.20/04. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this Law was the first nation-wide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since the Republic of Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation.

The “Central office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia” has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to “National office for protection of cultural monuments”, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to “National center for conservation” and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jovcevska, Biljana.

Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid.

The [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)]] established their branch in Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org.mk/AboutUs.aspx “ICOMOS Macedonia About Us”]. icomos.org.mk (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum - Ohrid is the second oldest institutions for historical preservation established in 1952. In 1956 the Institute was granted authority to protect movable and immovable cultural and historic heritage in the Ohrid region. The Institute has since executed numerous efforts for historic preservation, most notably aiding the recognition of the city of Ohrid as a UNESCO site of cultural heritage in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muzejohrid.mk/istorija “Историја”]. НУ Завод за Заштита на Спомениците на Културата и Музеј - Охрид. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the main authority for historic preservation is the Cultural Heritage Protection Office (Управа за заштита на културно наследство). The Office is an independent governmental organization under the Ministry of Culture, divided into three departments:
#Identification, Protection and Use of Cultural Heritage
#Prevention and Supervision
#Documentation, International Cooperation and Administrative Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001881/188172eo.pdf "Cultural Heritage in South-East Europe: Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of)" (PDF)].

=== Israel ===
In Israel, there are currently two laws concerning historic preservation, [[Antiquities Law of the State of Israel of 1978|Antiquities Law of the State of Israel]] (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000490|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planning and Building Law (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/1998/Pages/Planning%20and%20Building%20Law-%201965.aspx|title=Summay of the law in English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]].

However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000613|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years it hasn't been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests.

During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yossi Klein Halevi|Klein Halevi, Yossi]] (2011). [http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=96782691#6.2693.6.default האמרקניזציה של תל אביב].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel’s historic situations and are aligned with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.shimur.org/viewStaticPage.aspx?pageID=258|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council used to operate under the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]] but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimur.org/viewArticle.aspx?articleID=165|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites: Historical context on the Council's work and outline of future plans [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.il/building/engineering/Pages/preservation.aspx The Ministry of Defense statement regarding preservation within IDF bases [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include [[Knights Templar]] sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period.

A historic district in the [[United States]] is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, [[Contributing property|contributing]] and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] designates historic districts through the [[U.S. Department of Interior]], under the auspices of the [[National Park Service]]. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm Federal, State and Local Historic Districts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015030933/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}, TOOLBOX, FAQ, National Park Service. Retrieved 19 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Historic districts allows rural areas to preserve their characters through historic preservation programs. These include "Main Street" programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns. Using historic preservation programs as an economic development tool for local governments in rural areas has enabled some of those areas to take advantage of their history and develop a tourism market that in turn provides funds for maintaining an economic stability that these areas would not have seen otherwise.&lt;ref name="rdp"&gt;[http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=IND20529991 Stenberg, Peter L.

A similar concept exists in the United Kingdom: a [[Conservation area]] is designated in accordance with the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]] in order to protect a zone in which there are buildings of architectural or [[cultural heritage]] interest.

==National Parks==
{{main|National Park}}

In 1835, the English poet [[William Wordsworth]] described the [[Lake District]] as a "sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, the United States that led the world in the creation of [[United States National Park|National Parks]], areas of unspoiled natural wilderness, where the intrusion of civilization are intentionally minimal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The department of the interior designated several areas of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the [[Morristown National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/morr/ |title=Morristown National Historical Park - Morristown National Historical Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown.

In the United Kingdom, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] the [[ambassador]] to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the [[Ramblers' Association]] and other groups led to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].

== UNESCO ==
According to UNESCO’s 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as [[World Heritage Site]]s. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of “cultural heritage”. According to Article 1 of the Convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites “which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science” are to be designated cultural heritage.

A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the Convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage convention’s counterpart, The World Heritage Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/ The World Heritage Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt; is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the Convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The Committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List.

The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/ All available reports of the Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential challenges ==
Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks.

One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nber.org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/papers/w20446.pdf)%20(http://readings.sipx.com/in-efa1d268-3446-11e4-b0d4-22000a890e29/c-a5bb0b99-34dc-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b/x-18c7cf2c-4b0a-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b.pdf?Expires=1510044499&amp;Signature=OYOvpPRjsvsdxGk8mFJuuvpqTmeZ2aWRa5PyPPJ3HEyNSDr36kObybQETDowEcAnOP10WnB82VVejixBL~YiqGuKe6ZJ-fFchJ2tcVcrt4A7QNKhALWi1jE0z2XkqC8tZxb6picEAwMJ3MhUCtEHoA8-kajtxQQaA9QgAjfzX~4_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIVBE35QX7A7QYJEA|title=Preserving History or Hindering Growth? The Heterogeneous Effects of Historic Districts on Local Housing Markets in New York City|last=Been, Gould Ellen, Gedal, Glaeser, &amp; McCabe|first=Vicki, Ingrid, Michael, Edward, Brian J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2012). The politics and heritage of race and space in San Francisco’s Chinatown. In D. F. Ruggles (Ed.), ''On location'' (pp. 37–59). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. (2016). Getting Away From “No”: Straight Talk to Local Advocates. ''Forum Journal'' 30(2), 46-49.

==Careers==
Although volunteers continue to play a large role in historic preservation activities, the field has seen an increased level of professionalization. Today, there are many career options in historic preservation in the public, non-profit and private sectors. Institutes of secondary education (universities, colleges, etc.) in the United States offer both certificate and degree ([[Associate in Applied Science|A.A.S]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]], [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], [[Masters of Design Studies|M.D.S]], [[Master of Historic Preservation|M.H.P.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) programs in historic preservation. Some pupils—at schools with such programmes available—choose to enroll in "joint degree" programs, earning a degree in historic preservation along with one in another, related subject, often an [[Master of Architecture|MArch]], [[Master of Urban Planning|MUP]] or [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degree.

Possible career fields include:
;Architectural conservator: Focus specifically on the physical conservation of building materials.
;Architectural historian/historian: Primarily researches and writes statements expressing the historical significance of sites.
;Historic preservation planner: Most are employed by local, county, state or federal government planning agencies to administer tax abatement programs, ensure compliance with local ordinances and state and Federal legislation, and conduct design reviews to ensure that proposed projects will not harm historic and archaeological resources. At the state level, they are known as a [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] while at other levels of government they may be known as a Federal or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer. Some may also serve as consultants to local governments, conducting [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990|Section 106]] reviews in accordance with the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]].
;Preservation architect: Design and develop architectural conservation plans and work specifications in consultation with Engineers, Historians and Planners, ensuring compliance with local design guidelines to protect sensitive historic building fabric. Most are employed by private architecture firms though some find work with government agencies.
;Preservation craftsperson/[[Traditional trades|traditional trades practitioner]]: Employs knowledge of traditional building techniques and contemporary conservation technologies to complete the conservation, repair or restoration of historic buildings.
;Preservation engineer: Work with Architects to devise conservation solutions of a structural or material -specific nature. Most are employed by private architecture and/or engineering firms.
;[[Public historian]]/[[Heritage interpretation|resource interpreters]]: Most are employed by government agencies and private foundations to interpret the significance of historic resources for the general public.
;[[Historic site|Historic site administrator]]
;Non-profit sector careers: Engage in a variety of activities concerned with historic preservation advocacy, easements, and private foundations at the local, regional, statewide, or national levels.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Historical anthropology''' is a [[historiographical]] movement which applies methodologies and objectives from [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]] to the study of historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Like most such movements, it is understood in different ways by different scholars, and to some may be synonymous with the [[history of mentalities]], [[cultural history]], [[ethnohistory]], [[microhistory]], [[People's history|history from below]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]''. Anthropologists whose work has been particularly inspirational to historical anthropology include [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Arnold van Gennep]], [[Jack Goody]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] has contrasted historical anthropology with [[Social History]], finding that historical anthropology tends to focus on qualitative rather than quantitative data, smaller communities, and symbolic aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; Thus it reflects a turn away, in the 1960s, in [[Marxist historiography]] from 'the orthodox Marxist approach to human behaviour in which actors are seen as motivated in the first instance by economics, and only secondarily by culture or ideology', in the work of historians such as [[E. P. Thompson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt;

Historical anthropology was rooted in the [[Annales School]], associated with a succession of major historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pierre Nora]], along with researchers from elsewhere on the Continent such as [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. The label ''historical anthropology'' has been actively promoted by some recent Annales School historians, such as [[Jean-Claude Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Claude Schmitt |url=https://cem.revues.org/8862 |title=Anthropologie historique |publisher=Cem.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acrh.revues.org/1926 |title=L’anthropologie historique de l’Occident médiéval.

Histoire, Sciences sociales]] is still among the most influential French publications for research in historical anthropology.

Historical anthropology has been open to similar criticisms to anthropology: 'as [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] and [[John Comaroff|John]] and [[Jean Comaroff]] have observed, studies in which societies were represented in this way were often partial, biased, and unwitting handmaidens to the domination of non-Western peoples by Europeans and Americans'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; But since the Second World War, increasingly reflexive approaches have led to sophisticated developments of the field, and the banner of 'historical anthropology' has often attracted Anglo-American historians in ways that the Annales School did not: key figures have been [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Jay O'Brien (anthropologist)|Jay O'Brien]], [[William Roseberry]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Jane Schneider]], [[Peter Schneider (historian)|Peter Schneider]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], and people from elsewhere in the world such as [[Aaron Gurevich]].

'''Informbiro''' (also the '''Informbiro period''' or the '''time of the Informbiro''') was a period in the history of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] which spanned from 1948 to 1955, characterised by conflict and schism with the [[Soviet Union]]. The word ''Informbiro'' is the Yugoslav name for the [[Cominform]],  an abbreviation for "Information Bureau," from "Communist Information Bureau".

==History==
 {{see also|Tito–Stalin Split}}
The Tito–Stalin, or Yugoslav–Soviet split took place in the spring and early summer of 1948. Its title pertains to Josip Broz Tito, at the time the [[Yugoslav Prime Minister]] (President of the Federal Assembly), and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. In the West, Tito was thought of as a loyal communist leader, second only to Stalin in the Eastern Bloc. However, having largely liberated itself with only limited Red Army support,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=?}} Yugoslavia steered an independent course, and was constantly experiencing tensions with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav government considered themselves allies of Moscow, while Moscow considered Yugoslavia a satellite and often treated it as such. Previous tensions erupted over a number of issues, but after the Moscow meeting, an open confrontation was beginning.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}}

Next came an exchange of letters directly between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). In the first CPSU letter of 27 March 1948, the Soviets accused the Yugoslavs of denigrating Soviet socialism via statements such as "socialism in the Soviet Union has ceased to be revolutionary". It also claimed that the KPJ was not "democratic enough", and that it was not acting as a vanguard that would lead the country to socialism. The Soviets said that they "could not consider such a Communist party organization to be Marxist-Leninist, Bolshevik". The letter also named a number of high-ranking officials as "dubious Marxists" ([[Milovan Đilas]], [[Aleksandar Ranković]], [[Boris Kidrič]], and [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]]) inviting Tito to purge them, and thus cause a rift in his own party. Communist officials [[Andrija Hebrang (father)|Andrija Hebrang]] and [[Sreten Žujović]] supported the Soviet view.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=?}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}}

Tito, however, saw through it, refused to compromise his own party, and soon responded with his own letter. The KPJ response on 13 April 1948 was a strong denial of the Soviet accusations, both defending the revolutionary nature of the party, and re-asserting its high opinion of the Soviet Union. However, the KPJ noted also that "no matter how much each of us loves the land of socialism, the Soviet Union, he can in no case love his own country less".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}} In a speech, the Yugoslav Prime Minister stated
{{quote|We are not going to pay the balance on others' accounts, we are not going to serve as pocket money in anyone's currency exchange, we are not going to allow ourselves to become entangled in political spheres of interest. Why should it be held against our peoples that they want to be completely independent? And why should autonomy be restricted, or the subject of dispute? We will not be dependent on anyone ever again!|&lt;small&gt;Prime Minister Josip Broz Tito&lt;/small&gt;{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}}}}

The 31 page-long Soviet answer of 4 May 1948 admonished the KPJ for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse it of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had "saved them from destruction" (an implausible statement, as Tito's partisans had successfully campaigned against Axis forces for four years before the appearance of the Red Army there).{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=?}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}} This time, the Soviets named Josip Broz Tito and [[Edvard Kardelj]] as the principal "heretics", while defending Hebrang and Žujović. The letter suggested that the Yugoslavs bring their "case" before the [[Cominform]]. The KPJ responded by expelling Hebrang and Žujović from the party, and by answering the Soviets on 17 May 1948 with a letter which sharply criticized Soviet attempts to devalue the successes of the Yugoslav resistance movement.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}}

On 19 May 1948, a correspondence by [[Mikhail Suslov|Mikhail A. Suslov]] informed Josip Broz Tito that the [[Communist Information Bureau]], or Cominform (''Informbiro'' in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]), would be holding a session on 28 June 1948 in [[Bucharest]] almost completely dedicated to the "Yugoslav issue". The Cominform was an association of communist parties that was the primary Soviet tool for controlling the political developments in the Eastern Bloc. The date of the meeting, 28 June, was carefully chosen by the Soviets as the triple anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo Field]] (1389), the [[assassination of Archduke Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] (1914), and the adoption of the [[Vidovdan Constitution]] (1921).{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}}

Tito, personally invited, refused to attend under a dubious excuse of illness. When an official invitation arrived on 19 June 1948, Tito again refused. On the first day of the meeting, 28 June, the Cominform adopted the prepared text of a resolution, known in Yugoslavia as the "Resolution of the Informbiro" (''Rezolucija Informbiroa''). In it, the other Cominform (''Informbiro'') members expelled Yugoslavia, citing "nationalist elements" that had "managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership" of the KPJ. The resolution warned Yugoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions, and accused the party itself of "[[Trotskyism]]".{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}} This was followed by the severing of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, beginning the period of Soviet–Yugoslav conflict between 1948 and 1955 known as the [[Informbiro Period]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=?}}

After the break with the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia found itself economically and politically isolated as the country's Eastern Bloc-oriented economy began to falter. At the same time, Stalinist Yugoslavs, known in Yugoslavia as "cominformists", began fomenting civil and military unrest. A number of cominformist rebellions and military insurrections took place, along with acts of sabotage. However, the Yugoslav security service led by [[Aleksandar Ranković]], the [[UDBA]], was quick and efficient in cracking down on insurgent activity. Invasion appeared imminent, as Soviet military units massed along the border with the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], while the [[Hungarian People's Army]] was quickly increased in size from 2 to 15 divisions. The UDBA began arresting alleged Cominformists even under suspicion of being pro-Soviet.

However, from the start of the crisis, Tito began making overtures to the United States and the West. Consequently, Stalin's plans were thwarted as Yugoslavia began shifting its alignment. The West welcomed the Yugoslav-Soviet rift and in 1949 commenced a flow of economic aid, assisted in averting famine in 1950, and covered much of Yugoslavia's [[trade deficit]] for the next decade. The United States began shipping weapons to Yugoslavia in 1951. Tito, however, was wary of becoming too dependent on the West as well, and military security arrangements concluded in 1953 as Yugoslavia refused to join [[NATO]] and began developing a significant military industry of its own.&lt;ref name='W0088977'&gt;{{cite news | title=Military Assistance Agreement Between the United States and Yugoslavia, November 14, 1951 | url =http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/yugo001.asp | work=Lillian Goldman Law Library | accessdate =4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='W00996675'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14786.html |title=Yugoslavia – The Yugoslav-Soviet Rift |accessdate=4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the American response in the [[Korean War]] serving as an example of the West's commitment, Stalin began backing down from war with Yugoslavia.

The term refers to the [[Cominform]] Resolution of June 28, 1948 (resulting from the [[Tito–Stalin Split]]) that accused the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ), among other things, of "depart[ing] from Marxism-Leninism", exhibiting an "anti-Soviet attitude," "meeting criticism with hostility" and "reject[ing] to discuss the situation at an Informbureau meeting." Following these allegations, the resolution expelled the [[KPJ]] from Cominform. As a result, Yugoslavia fell outside of the Soviet sphere of influence, and the country's brand of [[communism]], with its independence from the Soviet line, was called ''[[Titoism]]'' by [[Moscow]] and considered treasonous. [[Purge|Party purge]]s against suspected "Titoites" were conducted throughout [[Eastern Europe]].

Significant evidence supports the opinion that the actual reason for the Cominform Resolution was the unwillingness of [[Josip Broz Tito]] to obey the instructions of [[Joseph Stalin]]. The most serious disputes concerned policy in the [[Balkans]]. In particular, Yugoslavia was considered to be pushing too fast towards unification with [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]].  Although following Stalin's proposal for a series of such unifications, Tito was seen to be proceeding without proper consultation with Moscow. Another issue was Tito's eagerness to [[export revolution]] to Greece, in contravention of Stalin's [[Percentages Agreement]] with the [[capitalist]] powers.

The Cominform Resolution is seen as a failed attempt by Stalin to command obedience not only from Tito, but from other national Communist parties as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In his memoirs, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] asserted that he was "absolutely sure that if the Soviet Union bordered Yugoslavia, Stalin would have intervened militarily."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The Soviets planned an invasion with Hungarian, Romanian, and Soviet troops, and in January 1951 large military maneuvers in Hungary simulated an invasion with the assumption of NATO intervention on the Yugoslav side. The threat of war declined, however; Yugoslavia was important to the West because of its importance to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the United States' strong defense of South Korea in the [[Korean War]] had likely helped discourage the Soviets, [[Béla Király]] stating that it "nipped Stalin's pet project in the bud". The country became an informal NATO member; in February 1951 the [[British Chiefs of Staff]] announced that a Soviet attack of Yugoslavia "would lead to world war", in June [[Koča Popović]] visited Washington DC for joint planning discussions, and by the mid 1950s the United States provided the country with one half billion dollars in military aid.&lt;ref name="schindler19980224"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://20committee.com/2015/09/29/dodging-armageddon-the-third-world-war-that-almost-was-1950/ | title=Dodging Armageddon: The Third World War That Almost Was, 1950 | author=Schindler, John R. | journal=Cryptologic Quarterly | date=1998-02-24 | pages=85–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period was also marked by dissent within the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] and subsequent repression and deportations of many pro-Soviet members to [[labor camp]]s and prisons, notably [[Goli Otok]] island.

Khrushchev reconciled with Tito after Stalin's 1953 death, but Yugoslavia remained outside the [[Eastern bloc]] and an informal NATO member.{{r|schindler19980224}} Tito dramatically changed his domestic policies and created an amnesty programme. Most of the prisons were closed and destroyed, and the government also loosened controls in the media to a much wider extent than in the rest of the Eastern bloc.

This period figures prominently in Yugoslav literature and cinema.

The '''Institut Nova Història''' (INH) is a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] cultural [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] with headquarters in [[Barcelona]]. Its members, of which the most prominent is the Catalan nationalist writer [[Jordi Bilbeny]], hold that history has been systematically manipulated by the Spanish (or "Castilian") state since the 15th century to eliminate the Catalan contribution to world history. They claim that major historical figures, including [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Erasmus]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] and others were Catalan. The institute's work has been criticised as [[pseudohistory]].

The institute promotes research, study and dissemination of ideas about Catalan influence on history through publications, conferences and symposia, in particular the annual "Symposium on the Catalan Discovery of America" in [[Arenys de Munt]]. It is funded by the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan autonomous government]], and has received support from [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalist]] politicians.

The INH considers that the history of Catalonia has been manipulated and distorted since the end of the 15th century to favour the construct of a centralised Spanish ("Castilian") state. By minimising the role of Catalonia—or the [[Crown of Aragon]]—in Spanish collective history through falsification, concealment and censorship or "appropriation" of certain historical episodes, the prevalence of Castilian ideology is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pere Forès i Malleu|first=Pere|title = Esborrant la traça catalana|magazine=Presència|location=Barcelona|number=2021|date=19 November 2010|pages=28–31|id= GI-143-1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its claims are:

A history rewritten by the Castilians'', noting that the books published by the INH "are very convincing", while in 2014, the former vice-president of the Generalitat de Catalunya, [[Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira]], participated at the reissue of Bilbeny's ''Brief account of the destruction of history'', where he spoke in praise of the book.&lt;ref name=EC140804&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernández|first=A.|title=Jordi Pujol y Carod se suman a la teoría de que Colón y los Pinzón eran catalanes|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/2014-07-03/jordi-pujol-y-carod-se-suman-a-la-teoria-de-que-colon-y-los-pinzon-eran-catalanes_155815/|work=El Confidencial|date=3 July 2014|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 INH symposium in [[Arenys de Munt]], under the title "The Catalan Discovery of America", was financed by the councils of Arenys de Munt and [[Arenys de Mar]], together with associations such as the {{lang|ca|Ateneu Independentista}} of Arenys de Munt.

==Criticism==
The INH has been described by one academic as "a group of Catalan self-styled scholars trying to prove and promote the idea that, throughout History, a massive conspiracy by the Crown of Castille, the Inquisition, and any institution that may be related to Castille, has been orchestrated against the nation of Catalonia to deprive it of its History and cultural identity in order to promote Castile".&lt;ref name=Rodríguez&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rodríguez López-Abadía |first=Arturo |date=2014 |title=The origins of Christopher Columbus, a never-ending controversy |url=https://www.academia.edu/9952462/The_origins_of_Christopher_Columbus_a_never-ending_controversy |journal=Revista Internacional Digilec|volume=Vol. 1|number=1|pages=1 to 10 |issn=2386-6691|access-date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was criticised in the Catalan parliament by the opposition party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Ciudadanos]] spokeswoman, Carina Mejías, who described its theories as "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sallés|first=Quico|title = C's: «És ridícul dir que Cristòfol Colom és català»|url=http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/67614/es/ridicul/dir/cristofol/colom/catala|work= NacióDigital.cat|date =22 April 2014|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Javier Barraycoa, vice-chancellor of the [[Abat Oliba CEU University]], former secretary of the {{ill|Carlist Traditionalist Communion|ca|Comunió Tradicionalista Carlista}} in Catalonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Directorio General de la Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|url=http://www.carlistas.es/descargas/organigrama.pdf|website=Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista| language=Spanish|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the anti-Catalanist organisation [[Somatemps]], said that the INH "has absolutely no recognition in the academic world" and that its members "have not been invited to any serious congress because it is impossible for them to defend these things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreno|first=Rosalina|title=Barraycoa: ‘Cataluña vive un delirio colectivo’|url=http://www.gaceta.es/noticias/cataluna-vive-delirio-colectivo-10072014-1128|work=La Gaceta |date=10 July 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Summer University''' is a short-term program that is held during the summer season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; University Kassel organizes the ISU as one of its internationalization strategies.

The program of the ISU is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971. During the winter season the University Kassel offers the [[International Winter University (IWU) Kassel]]. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of the ISU/IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and development of the programme==
The International Summer University started as one of the Hessen International Summer Universities that have been designed to attract international students to [[Hessen]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.isu-hessen.de Hessen International Summer Universities (ISU) homepage] for reference.&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, ISU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of University Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, ISU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to ISU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, ISU has brought some 50 international students to Kassel every year. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries.

The uniqueness of ISU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and [[cultural heritage]]. While ISU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program have been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, ISU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus.

The study program of ISU includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in "'teaching German as a foreign language"'. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for the engineering module usually cover the following topics: [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation strategies to climate change]], [[earthquake engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and integrated environmental science [[environmental science]]. Seminars for the German culture module usually covers topics such as [[history of germany]], German politics of the 20th century, [[intercultural communication]], and [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|German fairy tales]]. Students proficient in German language may choose the German-taught seminar of "Deutsche Geschichte und Politik im 20. Jahrhundert".

Students will be awarded 9 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [http://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/museums/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


[[Kassel]] is a mid-sized city located in northern Hessen in the center of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000, which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">This is a '''list of [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] inscription''', which include remaining official inscriptions on rocks, as well as minor ones written on bricks, metal, wood, hide, [[papyri]], and gems. Their significance is in the areas of [[Iranian languages|linguistics]], [[history of Iran|history]], and study of [[religion in Persia]]. Some of the inscriptions are lost and are known only through tradition.

Early royal Sasanian inscriptions were trilingual: [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] (in [[Inscriptional Pahlavi]]), [[Parthian language|Parthian]] (in [[Inscriptional Parthian]]) and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. Since the rule of [[Narseh]], Greek was omitted. [[Book Pahlavi]] script replaced Inscriptional Pahlavi in late Middle Persian inscriptions.

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.

#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;

The now-current name of "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day" dates to the first half of the 19th century (Francis Alexander Durivage, ''A Popular Cyclopedia of History'', 1835), translating French 
''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{sort|America North|[[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]}}
|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

&lt;!--after 1930 or so, journalistic use of the term "massacre" becomes too indiscriminate to the point of being used synonymously with "murder" or "unjustified killing".
Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

|During the 1990s, many [[Algerian Civil War#Village massacres|large-scale massacres of villagers]] in Algeria were perpetrated by groups attacking villages at night and cutting the throats of the inhabitants. The [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) has avowed its responsibility for many of them. The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994). According to a few reports former Algerian army officer, Habib Souaidia testified to his government's involvement in the massacres.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary emergence of language in the [[human|human species]] has been a subject of speculation for several centuries. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of direct evidence. Consequently, scholars wishing to study the origins of language must draw inferences from other kinds of evidence such as the [[human evolution|fossil record]], archaeological evidence, contemporary language diversity, studies of [[language acquisition]], and comparisons between human [[language]] and systems of communication existing [[Animal communication|among animals]] (particularly [[Great ape language|other primates]]). Many argue that the origins of language probably relate closely to the origins of [[behavioral modernity|modern human behavior]], but there is little agreement about the implications and directionality of this connection.

This shortage of [[empirical evidence]] has led many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study. In 1866, the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the western world until late in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. Inquiries into the origins of language. New York: [[Harper and Row]], p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are various hypotheses about how, why, when, and where language might have emerged.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie | last2 = Gibson | first2 = Kathleen Rita. | title = The Oxford handbook of language evolution | year = 2012 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford  ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954111-9 | oclc = 724665645 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, there is scarcely more agreement today than a hundred years ago, when [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]] provoked a rash of armchair speculation on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), The Origin of Language. Bristol: [[Thoemmes Press]], pp. 7–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1990s, however, a number of [[linguist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have attempted to address with new methods what some consider one of the hardest problems in science.&lt;!--Unbalanced opinion to call it the hardest problem in science. I'm sure some physicists would tell you that the understanding the origins of the universe is no easier.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Christiansen"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = Morten H |authorlink1=Morten H.

==Approaches==
One can sub-divide approaches to the origin of language according to some underlying assumptions:&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ulbæk | first1 = Ib | title = The origin of language and cognition|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | pages = 30–43 | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Continuity theories" built on the idea that language exhibits so much complexity that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form; therefore it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our primate ancestors. 
* "Discontinuity theories" take the opposite approach—that language, as a unique trait which cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans, must have appeared fairly suddenly during the course of [[human evolution]]. 
* Some theories see language mostly as an [[innate]] faculty—largely genetically encoded.
* Other theories regard language as a mainly [[cultural]] system—learned through social interaction.

[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single chance mutation occurred in one individual in the order of 100,000 years ago, installing the language faculty (a component of the mid-brain) in "perfect" or "near-perfect" form.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1996. ''Powers and Prospects. Reflections on human nature and the social order.'' London: Pluto Press, p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A majority of linguistic scholars {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} hold continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they envision language development. Among those who see language as mostly innate, some—notably [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref name="Pinker 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = S. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Natural language and natural selection | url = http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 707–784 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00081061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051123085422/http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | archivedate = 2005-11-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;—avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved in the usual gradual way.&lt;ref name="Pinker 1994"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Others in this intellectual camp—notably Ib Ulbæk&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"/&gt;—hold that language evolved not from primate communication but from primate cognition, which is significantly more complex.

Those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as [[Michael Tomasello]], see it developing from the cognitively controlled aspects of primate communication, these being mostly gestural as opposed to vocal.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 1996"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Tomasello | first1 = Michael | title = The cultural roots of language| editors = B M Velichkovskiĭ; Duane M Rumbaugh; Universität Bielefeld.

A very specific social structure—one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust—must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on "cheap signals" (words) an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]].

Because the [[emergence]] of language lies so far back in [[human prehistory]], the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces; neither can comparable processes be observed today. Despite this, the emergence of new sign languages in modern times—[[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], for example—may potentially offer insights into the developmental stages and creative processes necessarily involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kegl, J., A.

The time range for the evolution of language and/or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of ''[[Homo]]'' (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full [[behavioral modernity]] some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that ''[[Australopithecus]]'' probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of [[great ape]]s in general,&lt;ref name="Arcadi 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arcadi | first1 = AC. | title = Vocal responsiveness in male wild chimpanzees: implications for the evolution of language. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–23 |date=Aug 2000 | doi = 10.1006/jhev.2000.0415 | pmid = 10968929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (''[[proto-language]]'') as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'', while others place the development of [[symbolic communication]] only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with ''[[Homo sapiens]],'' currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, [[Johanna Nichols]]—a linguist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998.

(Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; A further study by Q. D. Atkinson&lt;ref name="Atkinson 2011"/&gt; suggests that successive population bottlenecks occurred as our African ancestors migrated to other areas, leading to a decrease in genetic and phenotypic diversity. Atkinson argues that these bottlenecks also affected culture and language, suggesting that the further away a particular language is from Africa, the fewer [[phonemes]] it contains. By way of evidence, Atkinson claims that today's African languages tend to have relatively large numbers of phonemes, whereas languages from areas in [[Oceania]] (the last place to which humans migrated), have relatively few.  Relying heavily on Atkinson's work, a subsequent study has explored the rate at which phonemes develop naturally, comparing this rate to some of Africa's oldest languages. The results suggest that language first evolved around 50,000–150,000 years ago, which is around the time when modern ''Homo sapiens'' evolved.&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135 | pmc = 3338724| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735289P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological and much other evidence indicates that language probably emerged somewhere in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] during the [[Middle Stone Age]], roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Botha 2009"&gt;

==Language origin hypotheses==

===Early speculations===
{{quotation|I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries.|Charles Darwin, 1871. ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex''&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1871). "The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. London: Murray, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1861, historical linguist [[Max Müller]] published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language:&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), ''The Origin of Language.'' Bristol: Thoemmes Press, pp. 7–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''bow-wow'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''pooh-pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise, etc.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''ding-dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory claims language emerged from collective rhythmic labor, the attempt to synchronize muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho.''
* '''Ta-ta'''. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by Sir Richard Paget.&lt;ref&gt;Paget, R. 1930. ''Human speech: some observations, experiments, and conclusions as to the nature, origin, purpose and possible improvement of human speech.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''ta-ta'' theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible.

Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J. R. 1964. ''The Tongues of Men and Speech.'' London: Oxford University Press, pp. 25–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. ''Inquiries into the origins of language.'' New York: Harper and Row, p. 243-44.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with these theories is that they are so narrowly mechanistic.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} They assume that once our ancestors had stumbled upon the appropriate ingenious ''mechanism'' for linking sounds with meanings, language automatically evolved and changed.

===Problems of reliability and deception===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 340 | issue = 1292 | pages = 227–230 |date=May 1993 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 | pmid = 8101657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="Smith 1994"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Smith| first1=J.Maynard|title=Must reliable signals always be costly?|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=47|issue=5|year=1994|pages=1115–1120|issn=0003-3472|doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists.

Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. We trust the signal, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primate social intelligence is "[[Machiavellian]]"—self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to [[deception|deceive]] each other, while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves.&lt;ref name="Byrne 1988"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Byrne | first1 = Richard W. | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew. | title = Machiavellian intelligence : social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans | year = 1988 | publisher = Clarendon Press  | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-852175-4 | oclc = 17260831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "de Waal (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1360010306 | last1 = de Waal | first1 = Frans B.

Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favor of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "[[displacement (linguistics)|displaced reference]]", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

====The 'mother tongues' hypothesis====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| chapter = Kin selection and "mother tongues": a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | title = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275–296 |url= http://homepage.univie.ac.at/tecumseh.fitch/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FitchKin2004_large.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of '[[kin selection]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 1–52 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 | pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the convergence of genetic interests between relatives—might be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally 'mother tongues'. If language evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable signals—words—to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2013"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie| title = Kin selection, pedagogy and linguistic complexity: whence protolanguage? | editors =  Rudolf P Botha, Martin Everaert| work = The evolutionary emergence of language : evidence and inference | year = 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 978-0-19-965485-7 | oclc = 856795812| pages = 77–96  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other primate mothers also share genes with their progeny, as do all other animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with more distant relatives. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited 'mother tongue' networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2013"/&gt;  Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal [[encephalization|growth of the human brain]] give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"/&gt;

====The 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' hypothesis====
Ib Ulbæk&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"/&gt; invokes another standard Darwinian principle—'[[reciprocal altruism]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you''. Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' could possibly have been enforced.&lt;ref name="Knight 2006"/&gt; Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2006"/&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to [[Signalling theory|advertise to the world]] their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen.&lt;ref name="Dessalles 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Dessalles| first1 =  Jean L. |title = Altruism, status and the origin of relevance|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 130–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The gossip and grooming hypothesis====

Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]] in his book ''[[Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language]]'', does for group-living humans what [[social grooming|manual grooming]] does for other primates—it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. Dunbar argues that as humans began living in increasingly larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this problem, humans developed 'a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming'—''vocal grooming''. To keep allies happy, one now needs only to 'groom' them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language—initially in the form of 'gossip'.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"/&gt; Dunbar's hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that the structure of language shows adaptations to the function of narration in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus|year=2014|contribution=Language evolved for storytelling in a super-fast evolution|editor=R. L. C. Cartmill|title=Evolution of Language|location=London|publisher=World Scientific|pp=114–121|url=https://www.academia.edu/9648129/language_evolved_for_storytelling_in_a_super_fast_evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of 'vocal grooming'—the fact that words are so cheap—would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Power, C.|year=1998|contribution=Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editor=J. R. Hurford|editor2=M. Studdert Kennedy|editor3=C. Knight|title=Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pp=111 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming—the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds—to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

====Ritual/speech coevolution====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport 1999"/&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Jerome| title = As Well as Words: Congo Pygmy Hunting, Mimicry, and Play,| editors = Rudolf P Botha; Chris Knight| work = The cradle of language | year = 2009 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5| oclc = 804498749| pages = 236–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

Norton | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-393-03838-5 | oclc = 807018262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a 'theory of the origins of language'. This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider—namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Knight 2010"/&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognized within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society—one where electronic communications technology and digital computers have already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for a nonhuman ape communicating with others in the wild. Not even the cleverest nonhuman ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|Lie and alternative, inherent in language ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies.

As digital hallucinations{{Clarification needed|date=May 2018}}, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction—those they actually use—are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Language consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world — they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"/&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society—namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called 'institutional facts') can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. R. 1996. ''The Construction of Social Reality''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; In any hunter-gatherer society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915]. "Origins of these beliefs". Chapter VII. In É. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life: A study in religious sociology''. Trans. J. W. Swain. Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205–239.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.

Critics of the theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the 'non-existence' hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 |title=Language and Other Cognitive Systems. What is Special About Language? |journal=Language Learning and Development |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=263–78 |year=2011 |last1=Chomsky |first1=Noam }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form,&lt;ref name="Three factors in language design"/&gt; prompting his critics in turn to retort that only something that does not exist—a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction—could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008"/&gt; The controversy remains unresolved.

===Tool culture resilience and grammar in early Homo===

While it is possible to imitate the making of tools like those made by early Homo under circumstances of demonstration, research on primate tool cultures show that non-verbal cultures are vulnerable to environmental change. In particular, if the environment in which a skill can be used disappears for a longer period of time than an individual ape's or early human's lifespan, the skill will be lost if the culture is imitative and non-verbal. Chimpanzees, macaques and capuchin monkeys are all known to lose tool techniques under such circumstances. Researchers on primate culture vulnerability therefore argue that since early Homo species as far back as Homo habilis retained their tool cultures despite many climate change cycles at the timescales of centuries to millennia each, these species had sufficiently developed language abilities to verbally describe complete procedures, and therefore grammar and not only two-word "proto-language".&lt;ref&gt;The multiple roles of cultural transmission experiments in understanding human cultural evolution, Alex Mesoudi, Andrew Whiten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chimpanzee Material Culture: Implications for Human Evolution, William Clement McGrew&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that early Homo species had sufficiently developed brains for grammar is also supported by researchers who study brain development in children, noting that grammar is developed while connections across the brain are still significantly lower than adult level. These researchers argue that these lowered system requirements for grammatical language make it plausible that the genus Homo had grammar at connection levels in the brain that were significantly lower than those of Homo sapiens and that more recent steps in the evolution of the human brain were not about language.&lt;ref&gt;New Frontiers in Language Evolution and Development: Introduction to the topics Volume, D. Kimbrough Oller, Rick Dale, Ulrike Griebel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birdsong, speech, and language: exploring the evolution of mind and brain, JJ Bolhuis, M Everaert&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structuralist theory===

[[Structural linguistics]] is an approach to the study of language founded by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and popularised through his posthumously published book ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' (1916).

According to [[Structural anthropology|structural anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], language and meaning—in opposition to "knowledge, which develops slowly and progressively"—must have appeared in an instant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of its appearance in the ascent of animal life, language can only have arisen all at once. Things cannot have begun to signify gradually. In the wake of a transformation which is not a subject of study for the social sciences, but for biology and psychology, a shift occurred from a stage when nothing had a meaning to another stage when everything had meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lévi-Strauss |first1=Claude |title=Introduction to the work of Marcel Mauss |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |isbn=0-7100-9066-8 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lévi-Strauss's hypothesis is a necessary consequence of Saussure's view of language as a formal system of differential elements: if a signifier only acquires meaning through its difference from other signifiers, then a hypothetical "first signifier" always already implies another signifier ("everything else" or "the rest of the universe") from which the first signifier is different. Thus, language, according to [[structuralism]], must have appeared all at once and not gradually since a semi-language is impossible.

===Chomsky's single step theory===

According to Chomsky's single mutation theory, the emergence of language resembled the formation of a crystal; with [[digital infinity]] as the [[seed crystal]] in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once [[Universal Darwinism|evolution]] added a single small but crucial keystone.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (2004). ''Language and Mind: Current thoughts on ancient problems.'' Part I &amp; Part II. In Lyle Jenkins (ed.), ''Variation and Universals in Biolinguistics.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 379–405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three factors in language design"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst some suggest it follows from this theory that language appeared rather suddenly within the history of human evolution, Chomsky, writing with computational linguist and computer scientist Robert C. Berwick, suggests it is completely compatible with modern biology. They note "none of the recent accounts of human language evolution seem to have completely grasped the shift from conventional Darwinism to its fully [[stochastic]] modern version—specifically, that there are stochastic effects not only due to sampling like directionless drift, but also due to directed stochastic variation in fitness, migration, and heritability—indeed, all the "forces" that affect individual or gene frequencies. ...  All this can affect evolutionary outcomes—outcomes that as far as we can make out are not brought out in recent books on the evolution of language, yet would arise immediately in the case of any new genetic or individual innovation, precisely the kind of scenario likely to be in play when talking about language's emergence."

Citing evolutionary geneticist [[Svante Pääbo]] they concur that a substantial difference must have occurred to differentiate ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from [[Neanderthal]]s to "prompt the relentless spread of our species who had never crossed open water up and out of Africa and then on across the entire planet in just a few tens of thousands of years. ... What we do not see is any kind of "gradualism" in new tool technologies or innovations like fire, shelters, or figurative art." Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the arrival of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa, and the last exodus from Africa, respectively). "That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons. It's time enough—within the ballpark for what Nilsson and Pelger (1994) estimated as the time required for the full evolution of a [[vertebrate]] eye from a single cell, even without the invocation of any 'evo-devo' effects."&lt;ref name="Berwick and Chomsky 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Berwick | first = Robert | last2 = Chomsky |first2= Noam | title = Why Only Us: Language and Evolution | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780262034241 | oclc = 934433881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that human language developed from [[gesture]]s that were used for simple communication.

Two types of evidence support this theory.
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] can use gestures or symbols for at least primitive communication, and some of their gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that [[oral communication|verbal language]] and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref name="Kimura 1993"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kimura | first1 = Doreen. | title = Neuromotor mechanisms in human communication | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-505492-7 | oclc = 26396505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A. J. |year=2002 |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1038/nn775 |pmid=11753419 |issue=1 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primate gesture is at least partially genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if they have never seen another ape perform that gesture. For example, gorillas beat their breasts. This shows that gestures are an intrinsic and important part of primate communication, which supports the idea that language evolved from gesture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arbib MA, Liebal K, Pika S |title=Primate vocalization, gesture, and the evolution of human language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1053–63; discussion 1063–76 |date=December 2008  |pmid=19391445 |doi=10.1086/593015|last2=Liebal |last3=Pika }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing has an effect on concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is also the fact that, from infancy, gestures both supplement and predict speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/015) |pmid=15072537 |title=Gesture Development |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=173–86 |year=2004 |last1=Capone |first1=Nina C. |last2=McGregor |first2=Karla K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ozçalişkan S, Goldin-Meadow S |title=Gesture is at the cutting edge of early language development |journal=Cognition |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=B101–13 |date=July 2005  |pmid=15996556 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.01.001|last2=Goldin-Meadow }}&lt;/ref&gt; This addresses the idea that gestures quickly change in humans from a sole means of communication (from a very young age) to a supplemental and predictive behavior that we use despite being able to communicate verbally. This too serves as a parallel to the idea that gestures developed first and language subsequently built upon it.

Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rizzolatti, G. (2008). Giacomo Rizzolatti on the Evolution of Language. Retrieved from http://gocognitive.net/interviews/evolution-language-gestures{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which supports the gestural theory:
# Language developed from the calls of our ancestors.
# Language was derived from gesture.
The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of our ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the center that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans. In monkeys, this center is located in the depths of the brain related to emotions. In the human system, it is located in an area unrelated to emotion. Humans can communicate simply to communicate—without emotions. So, anatomically, this scenario does not work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, we resort to the idea that language was derived from gesture (we communicated by gesture first and sound was attached later).

The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization. Various explanations have been proposed: 
# Our ancestors started to use more and more tools, meaning that their hands were occupied and could no longer be used for gesturing.&lt;ref name="Corballis 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =  Corballis | first1 = Michael C. | editors = Alison Wray| title = The transition to language | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-925066-0 | oclc = 48532303 | pages = 161–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Manual gesturing requires that speakers and listeners be visible to one another. In many situations, they might need to communicate, even without visual contact—for example after nightfall or when foliage obstructs visibility.
# A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal [[mimesis]] (imitative 'song-and-dance'), combining modalities because all signals (like those of nonhuman apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing. In that event, each multi-media display would have needed not just to disambiguate an intended meaning but also to inspire confidence in the signal's reliability. The suggestion is that only once community-wide contractual understandings had come into force&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6), Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; could trust in communicative intentions be automatically assumed, at last allowing ''Homo sapiens'' to shift to a more efficient default format. Since vocal distinctive features (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose, it was only at this point—when intrinsically persuasive body-language was no longer required to convey each message—that the decisive shift from manual gesture to our current primary reliance on ''spoken'' language occurred.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris |  title = Play as precursor of phonology and syntax| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic for | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 99–1119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A comparable hypothesis states that in 'articulate' language, gesture and vocalisation are intrinsically linked, as language evolved from equally intrinsically linked dance and song.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Humans still use manual and facial gestures when they speak, especially when people meet who have no language in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology |author1=Kolb, Bryan |author2=Ian Q. Whishaw  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |edition=5th |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, a great number of [[sign languages]] still in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities. These sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} (Compare the [[motor theory of speech perception]].)

Critics of gestural theory note that it is difficult to name serious reasons why the initial pitch-based [[vocal]] communication (which is present in primates) would be abandoned in favor of the much less effective non-vocal, gestural communication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} However, [[Michael Corballis]] has pointed out that it is supposed that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalization is rather homologous to and continued in involuntary reflexes (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise exist).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the "gesture-first" theory have been presented by researchers in [[psycholinguistics]], including [[David McNeill]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Tool-use associated sound in the evolution of language===

Proponents of the motor theory of language evolution have primarily focused on the visual domain and communication through observation of movements. The ''Tool-use sound hypothesis'' suggests that the production and perception of sound also contributed substantially, particularly ''incidental sound of locomotion'' (''ISOL'') and ''tool-use sound'' (''TUS'').&lt;ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Tool-use-associated sound in the evolution of language | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 993–1005 | doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0885-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable ''ISOL''. That may have stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations, and to mimic natural sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z| pmc = 3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, ''TUS'', and mimicry of ''TUS'', might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing ([[motor neuron]]s, hearing, [[proprioception]], touch, vision), and ''TUS'' stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains. Tool use and auditory gestures involve motor-processing of the forelimbs, which is associated with the evolution of vertebrate vocal communication. The production, perception, and mimicry of ''TUS'' may have resulted in a limited number of vocalizations or protowords that were associated with tool use.&lt;ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"/&gt; A new way to communicate about tools, especially when out of sight, would have had selective advantage. A gradual change in acoustic properties and/or meaning could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to ''TUS'' over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved.

===Mirror neurons and language origins===

In humans, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey [[mirror neuron]] system in the [[frontal lobe|inferior frontal cortex]], close to [[Broca's area]], one of the language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles, John R.]], ''Gesture, Language Origins, and Right Handedness'', Psycholoqy: 11,#24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by some [[Cytoarchitectonics|cytoarchitectonic]] homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area.&lt;ref name="Petrides 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petrides | first1 = M. | last2 = Cadoret | first2 = G. | last3 = Mackey | first3 = S. | title = Orofacial somatomotor responses in the macaque monkey homologue of Broca's area | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1235–8 |date=Jun 2005 | doi = 10.1038/nature03628 | pmid = 15988526 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1235P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of [[vocabulary]] expansion link to the ability of [[children]] to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations.

Analysis of the data using [[Granger Causality]] revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity of in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system.&lt;ref name=Schippers&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1001791107 |last=Schippers |first=MB |last2=Roebroeck |first2=A |last3=Renken |first3=R |last4=Nanetti |first4=L |last5=Keysers |first5=C |title=Mapping the Information flow from one brain to another during gestural communication |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |year=2010 |volume=107 |issue=20 |pages=9388–93 |pmid=20439736 |pmc=2889063 |bibcode=2010PNAS..107.9388S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all linguists agree with the above arguments, however. In particular, supporters of Noam Chomsky argue against the possibility that the mirror neuron system can play any role in the hierarchical recursive structures essential to syntax.&lt;ref name="Moro 2008"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Moro | first1 = Andrea. | title = The boundaries of Babel : the brain and the enigma of impossible language | year = 2008 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-13498-9 | oclc = 804408004}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Putting the baby down theory===
According to [[Dean Falk]]'s 'putting the baby down' theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref name="Falk 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Falk | first1 = D. | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early hominins: whence motherese? | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–503; discussion 503–83 |date=Aug 2004 | url = http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS260/Falk2004.pdf | pmid = 15773427 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing 'motherese'—an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.&lt;ref name="Falk 2004"/&gt;

In ''[[The Mental and Social Life of Babies]]'', psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] noted that no usable adult language could have evolved without interactive communication between very young children and adults. "No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaye|first=K.|title=The Mental and Social Life of Babies|year=1982|publisher=Univ.

=== From where to what theory ===
[[File:Language processing in the brain.png|thumb|Language is processed in 2 pathways in the human brain: the auditory ventral stream and auditory dorsal stream. The auditory ventral stream begins in the anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG), which projects to the anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS), middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and Temporal pole (TP). These regions then project to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This pathway is responsible for sound recognition. The auditory dorsal stream begins in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), which projects to the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), Sylvian parieto-temporal junction (Spt), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These regions then also project to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This pathway is responsible for sound localization and for the articulation of speech. Modified with permission from: Poliva, O.

[[File:From where to what.png|thumb|The 'from where to what' model of language evolution hypotheses 7 stages of language evolution: 1. The origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls between mothers and offspring used to relocate each other in cases of separation. 2. Offspring of early Homo modified the contact calls with intonations in order to emit two types of contact calls: contact calls that signal low level of distress and contact calls that signal high-level of distress. 3. The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation. In this scenario, the offspring emits a low-level distress call to express a desire to interact with an object, and the mother responds with a low-level distress call to enable the interaction or high-level distress call to prohibit it. 4. The use of intonations improved over time, and eventually, individuals acquired sufficient vocal control to invent new words to objects. 5. At first, offspring learned the calls from their parents by imitating their lip-movements. 6. As the learning of calls improved, babies learned new calls (i.e., phonemes) through lip imitation only during infancy. After that period, the memory of phonemes lasted for a lifetime, and older children became capable of learning new calls (through mimicry) without observing their parents' lip-movements. 7. Individuals became capable of rehearsing sequences of calls. This enabled the learning of words with several syllables, which increased vocabulary size. Further developments to the brain circuit responsible for rehearsing poly-syllabic words resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing lists of words (phonological working memory), which served as the platform for communication with sentences.

The ‘from where to what’ model argues that the co-localization of sound localization, audio-visual integration and discrimination of voices is evidence that speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls (stage 1 in figure). These calls are used by con-specifics in order to announce to the troop of their presence or location. In this scenario, speech could have began when a mother and offspring accidentally separated in the forest, and the two took turns emitting contact calls until they were re-united.

A possible transition from contact call to speech is that due to a mutation in the auditory dorsal stream, early hominans (i.e., Homo habilis) became capable of modifying the contact calls with intonations (stage 2 in figure). This enabled infants to emit two types of contact calls, one that signals the mother the infant is safe but desires her attention and another that signals immediate danger. Such a development would have provided the mother with an advantage as it informs her whether she needs to drop everything she carries and rush to the baby, or she can take her time. As generations passed and vocal control improved, mothers and offspring became capable of communicating with very simple yes-no question answer conversations (stage 3 in figure). In such a scenario, a baby is emitting a low-level distress call to signal desire to eat berries, and the mother responding with a low-level distress call to permit the activity or high-level distress call to prohibit it. This use of intonations in order to emit two types of calls, one for low level of distress and another for high level of distress could explain why humans today use intonations to transform words into questions or commands (for example, converting the word ‘food’ into a question or command with different intonations).

In accordance with the model, as generations passed, vocal control increased from just modifying calls with intonations to emitting novel calls (stage 4 in figure). During this time, infants learned these call by imitating their parents’ lip-movements (stage 5 in figure). This hypothesis explains the role of the auditory dorsal stream in many studies of lip-speech integration as occurs in lip-reading&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. A role for reading lips as a mean for the acquisition of novel calls can also explain the distinctive large human lips, which are not found with other apes. Supporting the model are studies of patients with damage to the auditory dorsal stream that were reported with impaired ability to repeat sentences and nonsense words ([[conduction aphasia]])&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, or impaired ability to name objects ([[Anomic aphasia|anomia]])&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

Learning calls by offspring imitating the lip-movements of their parents eventually reached a maximum limit of efficiency. At this point, the offspring were able to learn new vocalizations soon after hearing them, and the memory lasted for their entire life (stage 6 in figure). Such a transition could explain the tendency of babies, at their first year, to mimic their parents by imitating their lip-movements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tenenbaum|first=Elena J.|last2=Shah|first2=Rajesh J.|last3=Sobel|first3=David M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|last5=Morgan|first5=James L.|date=2012-06-20|title=Increased Focus on the Mouth Among Infants in the First Year of Life: A Longitudinal Eye-Tracking Study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00135.x|journal=Infancy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=534–553|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00135.x|issn=1525-0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubicek|first=Claudia|last2=de Boisferon|first2=Anne Hillairet|last3=Dupierrix|first3=Eve|last4=Lœvenbruck|first4=Hélène|last5=Gervain|first5=Judit|last6=Schwarzer|first6=Gudrun|date=2013-02-25|title=Face-scanning behavior to silently-talking faces in 12-month-old infants: The impact of pre-exposed auditory speech|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0165025412473016|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=106–110|doi=10.1177/0165025412473016|issn=0165-0254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewkowicz|first=David J.|date=2010|title=Infant perception of audio-visual speech synchrony.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0015579|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=66–77|doi=10.1037/a0015579|issn=1939-0599}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that after the first year this mimicry process ends&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|date=November 2004|title=Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1533|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|language=En|volume=5|issue=11|pages=831–843|doi=10.1038/nrn1533|issn=1471-003X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The development of a memory store for vocalizations in the parietal lobe of the auditory dorsal stream could have provided the neurological infra-structure for rehearsing lists of calls, thus resulting with poly-syllabic words (stage 7 in figure). Eventually the rehearsal of lists of syllables enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which made the communication with sentences possible. 

===Grammaticalisation theory===
'[[Grammaticalization|Grammaticalisation]]' is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially 'incorrect' usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, D. and D. Wilson 1986. ''Relevance. Communication and cognition.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, we can legitimately infer similar principles at work among our distant ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | year = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, P. J. 1998. Emergent grammar. In M. Tomasello (ed.), ''The New Psychology of Language.''

In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, we need to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying [[metaphor]]s rooted in shared bodily experience.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"&gt;Lakoff, G. and M. Johnson 1980. ''Metaphors We Live By.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as 'belly' or 'back' to convey abstract meanings such as 'inside' or 'behind'. Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones. For example, English speakers might say 'It is going to rain,' modeled on 'I am going to London.' This can be abbreviated colloquially to 'It's gonna rain.' Even when in a hurry, we don't say 'I'm gonna London'—the contraction is restricted to the job of specifying tense. From such examples we can see why grammaticalization is consistently unidirectional—from concrete to abstract meaning, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"/&gt;

Grammaticalization theorists picture early language as simple, perhaps consisting only of nouns.&lt;ref name="Heine 2007"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;111&lt;/sup&gt; Even under that extreme theoretical assumption, however, it is difficult to imagine what would realistically have prevented people from using, say, 'spear' as if it were a verb ('Spear that pig!'). People might have used their nouns as verbs or their verbs as nouns as occasion demanded. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =  Heine

Creativity drives grammatical change.&lt;ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"/&gt; This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritize imaginative mind-reading. Imaginative creativity—emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example—is not the kind of behavior which, say, [[vervet monkey]]s would appreciate or reward.&lt;ref name="Cheney Seyfarth 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheney|first1=Dorothy L.|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Robert M.|title=Constraints and preadaptations in the earliest stages of language evolution|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2–4| pages = 135–59|year=2005|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~seyfarth/Publications/LinguisticReview.pdf|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for 'Machiavellian' primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability.&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signals | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852684-1 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If humans escape these constraints, it is because in our case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states.

To focus on mental states is to accept fictions—inhabitants of the imagination—as potentially informative and interesting. Take the use of metaphor. A metaphor is, literally, a false statement.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, R. D. 1979. What metaphors mean. In S. Sacks (ed.), ''On Metaphor.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 29–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Think of Romeo's declaration, 'Juliet is the sun!' Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma in the sky, but human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalization is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. and R. Núñez 2000. ''Where mathematics comes from.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as we know it. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists. As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: "Grammaticalization requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another".&lt;ref name="Heine 2007"/&gt; Outside modern humans, such conditions do not prevail.

=== Evolution-Progression Model ===

Human language is used for self-expression; however, expression displays different stages. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound, i.e., language. Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Gallup, GG Jr.| title = Chimpanzees: Self recognition| journal = Science

Human survival became easier with the development of tools, shelter, and fire, thus facilitating further advancement of interaction, self-expression, and tool-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Kwang Hyun|title=Origins of human intelligence: The chain of tool-making and brain evolution|journal=ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTEBOOKS|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=5–22|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2016_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XXII_1_Ko.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Self-domesticated ape theory===
According to a study investigating the song differences between [[white-rumped munia]]s and its domesticated counterpart ([[society finch|Bengalese finch]]), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference—[[sexual selection]]—and remains relatively fixed. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage, and thus, decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, supposedly within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are thought incapable of learning song sequences from other finches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., &amp; Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song sintax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363–370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[bird vocalization]], brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor center, called the robust nucleus of [[arcopallium]], connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the arcopallium receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience. Control over song generation has become less constrained, more distributed, and more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., &amp; Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song syntax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363–370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to think about human evolution is that we are self-domesticated apes. Just as domestication relaxed selection for stereotypic songs in the finches—mate choice was supplanted by choices made by the aesthetic sensibilities of bird breeders and their customers—so might our cultural domestication have relaxed selection on many of our primate behavioral traits, allowing old pathways to degenerate and reconfigure. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop—they basically construct themselves "bottom up", with one set of neuronal interactions setting the stage for the next round of interactions—degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterizes human language. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Graham Ritchie|author2=Simon Kirby|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2005|title=Selection, domestication, and the emergence of learned communication systems|journal=Second International Symposium on the Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communication|volume=|pages=|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121153322/http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech and language for communication ==
{{See also|Animal communication|Animal language|Origin of speech}}
A distinction can be drawn between [[speech]] and [[language]]. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably the most natural one.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), Approaches to the Evolution of Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars view language as an initially cognitive development, its 'externalisation' to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is [[recursion]],&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hauser | first1 = MD. | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = N. | last3 = Fitch | first3 = WT. | title = The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1569–79 | date = Nov 2002 | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably [[Daniel Everett]]—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g. [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]]) which allegedly lack this feature.&lt;ref name="Everett 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everett|first1=Daniel L.|title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Piraha Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=46| issue=4|year=2005| pages=621–646| doi=10.1086/431525|url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zhordania | first = I. M. | title = Who asked the first question : the origins of human choral singing, intelligence, language and speech | publisher = Logos Tbilisi Ivane Javakhishvili State University | location = Tbilisi, Georgia | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789994031818 | oclc= 224993377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some captive primates (notably [[bonobos]] and [[chimpanzees]]), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves. {{Citation needed|reason=The chimp Washoe, pointing first doll, and then the mouth was able to ask the simple question: Time to eat?|date=January 2014}} Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception—tonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented—use similar rising "question intonation" for [[yes–no question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bolinger, Dwight L. (Editor) 1972. ''Intonation''. Selected Readings. Harmondsworth: Penguin, pg.314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruttenden 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cruttenden | first1 = Alan | title = Intonation | year = 1986 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-26028-2 | oclc = 12103838| pages = 169–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is a strong evidence of the universality of [[question intonation]]. In general, according to some authors, sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==Cognitive development and language==
One of the intriguing abilities that language users have is that of high-level [[reference]] (or [[deixis]]), the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions. According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system:

* [[Theory of mind]]
* Capacity to acquire non-linguistic conceptual representations, such as the object/kind distinction
* Referential vocal signals
* Imitation as a rational, intentional system
* Voluntary control over signal production as evidence of intentional communication
* [[Numerical cognition|Number representation]]&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt;

===Theory of mind===
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Call and Tomasello's research on [[chimpanzees]] supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Number representation===
In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Matsuzawa (1985) attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1–9 with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children have an [[A-Ha! moment|"a-ha!" moment]] and understand that the value of any integer ''n'' is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one, similar to their approach to other referential symbols, while children first learn an arbitrary list of symbols (1, 2, 3, 4...) and then later learn their precise meanings.&lt;ref name="Carey 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Susan|title=Cognitive Foundations of Arithmetic: Evolution and Ontogenisis|journal=Mind and Language| volume=16|issue=1|year=2001| pages=37–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-0017.00155|url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/carey2001c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the "open-ended generative property" of language in human numeral cognition.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt;

==Linguistic structures==

===Lexical-phonological principle===
Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F.|title=The Origin of Speech|journal=Scientific American| volume=203| issue=3|year=1960|pages=88–96|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88|url=http://www.gifted.ucalgary.ca/dflynn/files/dflynn/Hockett60.pdf|bibcode=1960SciAm.203c..88H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important:

* Productivity: users can create and understand completely novel messages.
** New messages are freely coined by blending, analogizing from, or transforming old ones.
** Either new or old elements are freely assigned new semantic loads by circumstances and context. This says that in every language, new idioms constantly come into existence.
*Duality (of Patterning): a large number of meaningful elements are made up of a conveniently small number of independently meaningless yet message-differentiating elements.

The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items. Under the specific [[phonotactic]] rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units. Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principle are known to exist outside of humans. While all (or nearly all) have been documented in some form in the natural world, very few coexist within the same species. Bird-song, singing nonhuman apes, and the songs of whales all display phonological syntax, combining units of sound into larger structures apparently devoid of enhanced or novel meaning. Certain other primate species do have simple phonological systems with units referring to entities in the world. However, in contrast to human systems, the units in these primates' systems normally occur in isolation, betraying a lack of lexical syntax. There is new evidence to suggest that Campbell's monkeys also display lexical syntax, combining two calls (a predator alarm call with a "boom", the combination of which denotes a lessened threat of danger), however it is still unclear whether this is a lexical or a morphological phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Pidgins and creoles===
{{Main|Creole language|pidgin}}
Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed [[word order]] and the words have no [[inflection]].&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Jared M. | title = The third chimpanzee : the evolution and future of the human animal |chapter = Bridges to human language | year = 1992 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-06-018307-3 | oclc = 24246928| pages = 141–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If contact is maintained between the groups speaking the pidgin for long periods of time, the pidgins may become more complex over many generations. If the children of one generation adopt the pidgin as their native language it develops into a [[creole language]], which becomes fixed and acquires a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. The syntax and morphology of such languages may often have local innovations not obviously derived from any of the parent languages.

Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not share any common language origins. In addition, creoles share similarities despite being developed in isolation from each other. [[Language bioprogram theory|Syntactic similarities]] include [[subject–verb–object]] word order. Even when creoles are derived from languages with a different word order they often develop the SVO word order. Creoles tend to have similar usage patterns for definite and indefinite articles, and similar movement rules for phrase structures even when the parent languages do not.&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"/&gt;

===Primate communication===
Field primatologists can give us useful insights into [[great ape]] communication in the wild.&lt;ref name="Arcadi 2000"/&gt; An important finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signalers' emotional and bodily states.

The [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s in the primate brain are responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, tongue, mouth, and larynx, as well as recognizing sounds. Primates are known to make "vocal calls", and these calls are generated by circuits in the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]].&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron., ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education, Inc. (2007), {{ISBN|0-13-227584-8}} pages 789–90&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wild, the communication of [[vervet monkey]]s has been the most extensively studied.&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"/&gt; They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a "leopard call", a "snake call", and an "eagle call".&lt;ref name="Seyfarth Cheney 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyfarth|first1=Robert M.|last2=Cheney|first2=Dorothy L.| last3=Marler| first3=Peter| title=Vervet monkey alarm calls: Semantic communication in a free-ranging primate|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=28| issue=4| year=1980| pages=1070–1094 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80097-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each call triggers a different defensive strategy in the monkeys who hear the call and scientists were able to elicit predictable responses from the monkeys using loudspeakers and prerecorded sounds.

Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different "words" in reference to different foods. They recorded vocalizations that chimps made in reference, for example, to grapes, and then other chimps pointed at pictures of grapes when they heard the recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1173219994 | title=The referentiality of chimpanzee vocal signaling: behavioral and acoustic analysis of food barks |author=Gibbons, Christopher M.| year=2007 |publisher=[[Ohio State University]]| postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slocombe Zuberbühler 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slocombe|first1=Katie E.|last2=Zuberbühler|first2=Klaus|title=Functionally Referential Communication in a Chimpanzee|journal=Current Biology|volume=15| issue=19|year=2005| pages=1779–1784|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.068|pmid=16213827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ardipithecus ramidus''===

A study published in ''Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology'' in 2017 claims that ''A. ramidus'',  a hominin dated at approximately 4.5Ma, shows the first evidence of an anatomical shift in the hominin lineage suggestive of increased vocal capability.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej |volume=68 |pages=101–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study compared the skull of ''A. ramidus'' with twenty nine chimpanzee skulls of different ages and found that in numerous features ''A. ramidus'' clustered with the infant and juvenile measures as opposed to the adult measures. Significantly, such affinity with the shape dimensions of infant and juvenile chimpanzee skull architecture was argued may have resulted in greater vocal capability. This assertion was based on the notion that the chimpanzee vocal tract ratios that prevent speech are a result of growth factors associated with puberty—growth factors absent in ''A. ramidus'' ontogeny.  ''A. ramidus'' was also found to have a degree of cervical lordosis more conducive to vocal modulation when compared with chimpanzees as well as cranial base architecture suggestive of increased vocal capability.

What was significant in this study was the observation that the changes in skull architecture that correlate with reduced aggression are the same changes necessary for the evolution of early hominin vocal ability. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity.

While the skull of ''A. ramidus'', according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest ''A. ramidus''—based on similar vocal tract ratios—may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:

{{quote|We propose that as a result of paedomorphic morphogenesis of the cranial base and craniofacial morphology ''Ar. ramidus'' would have not been limited in terms of the mechanical components of speech production as chimpanzees and bonobos are. It is possible that ''Ar. ramidus'' had vocal capability approximating that of chimpanzees and bonobos, with its idiosyncratic skull morphology not resulting in any significant advances in speech capability. In this sense the anatomical features analysed in this essay would have been exapted in later more voluble species of hominin. However, given the selective advantages of pro-social vocal synchrony, we suggest the species would have developed significantly more complex vocal abilities than chimpanzees and bonobos.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

===Early ''Homo''===
Regarding articulation, there is considerable speculation about the language capabilities of early ''[[Homo]]'' (2.5 to 0.8 million years ago). Anatomically, some scholars believe features of [[bipedalism]], which developed in [[australopithecine]]s around 3.5 million years ago, would have brought changes to the skull, allowing for a more L-shaped vocal tract. The shape of the tract and a larynx positioned relatively low in the neck are necessary prerequisites for many of the sounds humans make, particularly vowels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Other scholars believe that, based on the position of the larynx, not even [[Neanderthals]] had the anatomy necessary to produce the full range of sounds modern humans make.&lt;ref name="Aronoff 2001"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Aronoff | first1 = Mark. | last2 = Rees-Miller | first2 = Janie. | title = The handbook of linguistics | year = 2001 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-631-20497-8 | oclc = 43115110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier proposed that differences between ''Homo sapiens'' and Neanderthal vocal tracts could be seen in fossils, but the finding that the Neanderthal [[hyoid bone]] (see below) was identical to that found in ''Homo sapiens'' has weakened these theories.

''Hmmmmm'' is an acronym for ''h''olistic (non-compositional), ''m''anipulative (utterances are commands or suggestions, not descriptive statements), ''m''ulti-''m''odal (acoustic as well as gestural and facial), [[origin of music|''m''usical]], and ''m''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Mithen | first1 = Steven J. | title = The singing neanderthals : the origins of music, language, mind, and body | year = 2006 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-02192-1 | oclc = 62090869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, [[Richard G. Klein]] in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit. For 2 million years following the emergence of ''Homo habilis,'' the stone tool technology of hominins changed very little. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the crude stone tool kit of archaic humans as impossible to break down into categories based on their function, and reports that Neanderthals seem to have had little concern for the final aesthetic form of their tools. Klein argues that the Neanderthal brain may have not reached the level of complexity required for modern speech, even if the physical apparatus for speech production was well-developed.&lt;ref name="kleinbio"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402190101 |pmid=15079069 |pmc=395972 |title=Biography of Richard G.

Based on computer simulations used to evaluate that evolution of language that resulted in showing three stages in the evolution of syntax, Neanderthals are thought to have been in stage 2, showing they had something more evolved than proto-language but not quite as complex as the language of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0959774303000040 |title=Pleistocene Exchange Networks as Evidence for the Evolution of Language |journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal |volume=13 |pages=67–81 |year=2003 |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The descended larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch.

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs—increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food—we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit—so it is claimed—must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"/&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech, thus not excluding that it was selected for e.g. improved singing ability.

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"—giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonemic diversity===
In 2011, Quentin Atkinson published a survey of [[phoneme]]s from 500 different languages as well as [[language families]] and compared their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa.  The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and [[Oceanic languages|Oceania]] and South America had the smallest number.  After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations.  Atkinson's "best fit" model is that language originated in central and southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago.  This predates the hypothesized [[Coastal migration|southern coastal peopling]] of Arabia, India, southeast Asia, and Australia.  It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkinson |first=Quentin |title=Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa |url=http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/prelims/2011/Atkinson-346-9.pdf |work=Science Magazine |volume=332 |pages=346–349 |date=2011 |access-date=9 July 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.1199295 |pmid=21493858|bibcode=2011Sci...332..346A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In religion and mythology===
{{Main|Mythical origins of language}}
{{See also|Divine language|Adamic language}}
The search for the origin of language has a long history rooted in [[mythology]]. Most mythologies do not credit humans with the invention of language but speak of a [[divine language]] predating human language. Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the [[language of the birds]], are also common, and were of particular interest during the [[Renaissance]].

[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As [[Brahman]]'s "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s". The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survived a flood, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begat many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]], were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Old Testament, the Book of Genesis (11) says that God prevented the [[Tower of Babel]] from being completed through a miracle that made its construction workers start speaking different languages.  After this, they migrated to other regions, grouped together according to which of the newly created languages they spoke, explaining the origins of languages and nations outside of the fertile crescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert T. |last=Pennock |title=Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism |publisher=Bradford Books |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aC1OccYnX0sC&amp;dq=Tower+of+Babel:+The+Evidence+Against+the+New+Creationism|isbn=9780262661652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical experiments===
{{main|Language deprivation experiments}}
History contains a number of anecdotes about people who attempted to discover the origin of language by experiment. The first such tale was told by [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2.2). He relates that Pharaoh Psammetichus (probably [[Psammetichus I]], 7th century BC) had two children raised by a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. When one of the children cried "bekos" with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for "bread". From this, Psammetichus concluded that the first language was Phrygian. King [[James V of Scotland]] is said to have tried a similar experiment; his children were supposed to have spoken [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Both the medieval monarch [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and [[Akbar]] are said to have tried similar experiments; the children involved in these experiments did not speak. The current situation of [[deaf people]] also points into this direction.

===History of research===
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
Modern linguistics does not begin until the late 18th century, and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[animism#Philosophy|animist]] theses of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origin seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem. An increasingly systematic approach to [[historical linguistics]] developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of [[Karl Brugmann]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as [[universal grammar]], [[mass comparison]] and [[glottochronology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The "origin of language" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in [[neurolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[human evolution]]. The ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' introduced "Origin of language" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of [[evolutionary linguistics]] are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[File:Cara-oculta-luna.jpg|thumb|The Moon's heavily cratered [[Far side of the Moon|far-side]]]]

The '''origin of the Moon''' is usually explained by a [[Mars]]-sized body striking the Earth, making a debris ring that eventually collected into a single [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], but there are a number of variations on this [[giant-impact hypothesis]], as well as alternate explanations, and research into how the Moon came to be continues.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140907"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Revisiting the Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html |date=September 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed scenarios include captured body, fission, formed together (condensation theory), [[planetesimal]] collisions (formed from asteroid-like bodies), and collision theories.&lt;ref name=theories&gt;[http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_formation.html Theories of Formation for the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard giant-impact hypothesis suggests the Mars-sized body, called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], impacted Earth, creating a large debris ring around Earth, which then accreted to form the Moon. This collision also resulted in the 23.5° [[Axial tilt|tilted axis]] of the earth, thus causing the seasons.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; The Moon's [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotopic]] ratios seem to be essentially identical to Earth's.&lt;ref name=wiechert&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Oxygen Isotopes and the Moon-Forming Giant Impact  | last1=Wiechert | first1=U. | last2=Halliday | first2=A.

{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
{{quote box|width=22em|"One of the challenges to the longstanding theory of the collision, is that a Mars-sized impacting body, whose composition likely would have differed substantially from that of Earth, likely would have left Earth and the moon with different chemical compositions, which they are not."|—NASA&lt;ref name=nasa1&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/moon_formation.html NASA Lunar Scientists Develop New Theory on Earth and Moon Formation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Lunar Sample 61016 - Big Muley.jpg|thumb|right|Lunar sample 61016, better known as "[[Big Muley]]"]]
Some theories have been stated that presume the Earth had no large moons early in the formation of the Solar System, 4.6 billion years ago, Earth being basically rock and lava. Theia, an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of this ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.

The hypothesis requires a collision between a body about 90% of the present size of Earth, and another the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial radius and a tenth of its mass). The colliding body has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient angular momentum to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.

[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tons of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the [[temperature]] would have risen to 10,000&amp;nbsp;°C (18,000&amp;nbsp;°F).

The Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core is explained by Theia's core accreting into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccreation of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[magma]] ocean.

The newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small pre-existing satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth–Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = J.

Another issue is lunar and Earth isotope comparisons. In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.&lt;ref name=wiechert/&gt; Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar system bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (&lt;1 percent).&lt;ref name=ps2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3–4 |date=October 2007 | pages=438–449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;

To help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies—each five times the size of Mars—collided, then re-collided, forming a large disc of debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt; The paper was called “Forming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact,” by R.M Canup.&lt;ref name=nasa1/&gt;

A 2012 study on the depletion of [[zinc]] isotopes on the Moon supported the giant-impact origin for Earth and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7420/full/nature11507.html Paniello, et al. - Zinc isotopic evidence for the origin of the Moon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a study was released that indicated that water in lunar magma is indistinguishable from [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s and nearly the same as that of Earth in [[Isotopic signature|isotopic composition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ Earth-Moon: A Watery "Double-Planet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807172422/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ |date=2013-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6138/1317.abstract A. Saal, et al. - Hydrogen Isotopes in Lunar Volcanic Glasses and Melt Inclusions Reveal a Carbonaceous Chondrite Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant-impact hypothesis was again challenged in September 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | author = Daniel Clery | title = Impact Theory Gets Whacked | volume = 342 | page = 183 | date = 11 October 2013 | doi=10.1126/science.342.6155.183 | pmid=24115419}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a growing sense that lunar origins are more complicated.{{Vague|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name=clery&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6155/183 Daniel Clery -Impact Theory Gets Whacked]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of California]] developed computer models demonstrating that one possible outcome of a [[Disrupted planet|planetary collision]] is that it creates a [[synestia]], a mass of vaporized rock and metal which form a [[torus]] extending beyond the lunar orbit. The synestia will eventually shrink and cool to create the satellite and reform the impacted planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Javier Barbuzano |title=Could a Giant Impact Have Vaporized Earth to Create the Moon? |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/could-a-giant-impact-have-vaporized-earth-to-create-the-moon/ |date=March 1, 2018 |work=Sky and Telescope |accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is that before the giant impact, Earth had one or more normal satellites that shared its composition. Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and so Earth.

In 2017, planetary researchers at Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel offered a new theory that suggests the moon was forged in a brutal rain of cosmic debris that repeatedly hammered the fledgling Earth over millions of years. They determined that a series of smaller impacts, which were likely more common in the early solar system, could blast enough Earth rocks and dirt into orbit to form a small moonlet. As repeated impacts created more balls of debris, the moonlets could merge over time into one large moon.&lt;ref name="WSJ-20170109"&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Lee Hotz |title=Researchers Suggest New Theory for the Moon’s Origin |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-suggest-new-theory-for-the-moons-origin-1483977602|date=January 9, 2017 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capture ===
This hypothesis states that the Moon was captured by the Earth.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; This was popular until the 1980s, and some things in favor of this model include the Moon's size, orbit, and tidal locking.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt;

One problem is understanding the capture mechanism.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; A close encounter with Earth typically results in either collision or altered trajectories. For this hypothesis to function, there might have been a large [[atmosphere]] around the primitive Earth, which would slow the movement of the Moon by natural [[aerobraking]] before it could escape. That hypothesis may also explain the [[irregular satellite]] orbits of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Image:Earth-moon-to-scale.svg|thumb|center|800px|Earth and Moon to scale, 500 km per pixel]]

===Fission===
This is the now discredited hypothesis that an ancient, rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of its mass.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180323131439/http://lunarorigin.com:80/lunar-origin-models/ Lunar Origin]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was proposed by [[George Darwin]] (son of the famous biologist [[Charles Darwin]]) in the 1800s and retained some popularity until Apollo.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; The Austrian geologist Otto Ampherer in 1925 also suggested the emerging of the Moon as cause for [[continental drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01558835?LI=true#page-1 Die Naturwissenschaften, July 1925 (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed that the [[Pacific Ocean]] represented the scar of this event.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; Today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young, about 200 million years old or less, whereas the Moon is much older. The Moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material, which originated inside the proto-Earth in the Precambrian.&lt;ref name=Zhang/&gt;

[[File:Lunar Thorium concentrations.jpg|thumb|Thorium concentrations on the Moon, as mapped by ''[[Lunar Prospector]]'']]

===Accretion===
The hypothesis of accretion suggests that the Earth and the Moon formed together as a double system from the primordial [[accretion disk]] of the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="The Formation of the Moon"&gt;[http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/lunaform.html The Formation of the Moon] burro.cwru.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system or why the Moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the Earth (25% of its radius compared to 50% for the Earth).&lt;ref name="The Formation of the Moon"/&gt;

===2011===
In 2011, it was theorized that a second moon existed 4.5 billion years ago, and later had an impact with the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10289 | volume=476 | title=Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon | year=2011 | journal=Nature | pages=69–72 | last1 = Jutzi | first1 = M.| bibcode=2011Natur.476...69J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">The '''Pontifical Committee of Historical Sciences''' is a division of the [[Roman Curia]] established on 7 April 1954 by [[Pope Pius XII]]. 

==Background==
Pope Pius XII created this Committee on 7 April 1954 as the successor to the Commission of Cardinals for Historical Studies, which Pope Leo XIII had created on 18 August 1883 with the [[apostolic letter]] ''Saepenumero considerantes''. That commission was created to contribute to the development and proper use of historical sciences, especially late in the nineteenth century when parts of the Vatican's historical records, known as the [[Vatican Secret Archive]], was opened to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=it | website= Pontficio Comitato di Scienze Storiche | title= Profilo storico del Comitato| accessdate=7 April 2018 | url=http://www.historia.va/content/scienzestoriche/it/struttura-del-comitato/profilo-storico.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Committee was created to foster cooperation with the [[International Committee of Historical Sciences]], which was scheduled to hold its convention in Rome in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Otto | editor-first1=Bernd-Christian  | editor-first2= Susanne |editor-last2=Rau |editor-first3= Jörg |editor-last3= Rüpke| title=History and Religion: Narrating a Religious Past|date=2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location=Berlin/Boston| page=452|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YM55CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA452&amp;|accessdate=7 April 2018 | first=Giovanni | last= Filoramo | chapter= Locating the history of Christianity between the history of the church and the History of Religions: The Italian case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The Committee is charged with promoting the use of ecclesiastical archives for historical research and fostering cooperation with ecclesiastical and extra-ecclesial institutions and associations, particularly at the international level. It sponsors seminars and conferences, both independently and in concert with peer organizations; reviews the historical data presented in the ''[[Pontifical Yearbook]]''; collaborates with multinational scientific initiatives ([[UNESCO]]); and sponsors internships for the study of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].

In 2011, the Committee held a conference devoted to St. [[Catherine of Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency= Catholic News Agency | url = https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/italian-conference-set-to-honor-st.-catherine-of-siena | accessdate = 8 April 2018 | date= 21 October 2011| title = Italian conference set to honor St. Catherine of Siena | first= David |last=Kerr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it marked the 1700th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge|Battle of Ponte Milvio]] with a conference called "Constantine the Great.

'''Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact''' theories relate to visits or interactions with the [[Americas]] and/or [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by  people from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], or [[Oceania]] before [[Columbus's first voyage]] to the [[Caribbean]] in 1492.&lt;ref name="RileyKelley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carroll L.

Two historical cases of pre-Columbian contact are accepted amongst the scientific and scholarly mainstream.

The scientific and scholarly responses to other post-[[prehistory]], pre-Columbian contact claims have varied. Some such contact claims are examined in reputable peer-reviewed sources. Other contact claims, typically based on circumstantial and ambiguous interpretations of archaeological finds, cultural comparisons, comments in historical documents, and narrative accounts, have been dismissed as [[fringe science]] or [[pseudoarcheology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Beck Kehoe]] (2003)[http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_17_1_kehoe.pdf The Fringe of American Archaeology: Transoceanic and Transcontinental Contacts in Prehistoric America].

[[Vikings |Norse]] journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence. A Norse colony in [[Greenland]] was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (''[[Thing (assembly)|þing]]'') taking place at [[Brattahlíð]] and a bishop at [[Gardar, Greenland|Garðar]].&lt;ref name="WurmMühlhäusler1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Few sources describing contact between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and Norse people exist. Contact between the [[Thule people]] (ancestors of the modern [[Inuit]]) and Norse between the 12th or 13th centuries is known. The Norse Greenlanders called these incoming settlers "[[skræling]]ar". Conflict between the Greenlanders and the "skrælings" is recorded in the ''[[Icelandic Annals]]''. The term skrælings is also used in the Vínland sagas, which relate to events during the 10th century, when describing trade and conflict with native peoples.&lt;ref name="Seaver2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirsten A.

== Claims of Polynesian contact ==

=== Claims involving sweet potato ===
The [[sweet potato]], which is native to the Americas, was widespread in [[Polynesia]] when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the [[Cook Islands]] to 1000 CE, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 CE and spread across [[Polynesia]] from there.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tilburg, Jo Anne. 1994.

=== Claims involving Peruvian mummies ===
A team of academics headed by the [[University of York]]'s Mummy Research Group and BioArch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/magazine/aprilmag08.pdf |title=28801_April08.indd |publisher=York.ac.uk |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while examining a Peruvian mummy at the [[Bolton Museum]], found that it had been embalmed using a tree [[resin]].  Before this it was thought that Peruvian mummies were naturally preserved. The resin, found to be that of an ''[[Araucaria]]'' [[Pinophyta|conifer]] related to the [[Araucaria araucana|'monkey puzzle tree']], was from a variety found only in [[Oceania]] and probably [[New Guinea]]. "Radiocarbon dating of both the resin and body by the University of Oxford's radiocarbon laboratory confirmed they were essentially contemporary, and date to around CE 1200."&lt;ref&gt;From the University of York Magazine, page 9, April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving California canoes ===
[[File:Chumash Tomol 'Elye'wun paddlers, CINMS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''‘Elye’wun'', a reconstructed Chumash [[tomol]]]]
Researchers including Kathryn Klar and Terry Jones have proposed a theory of contact between Hawaiians and the [[Chumash people]] of [[Southern California]] between 400 and 800 CE. The sewn-plank canoes crafted by the Chumash and neighboring [[Tongva people|Tongva]] are unique among the indigenous peoples of North America, but similar in design to larger canoes used by Polynesians for deep-sea voyages. ''[[Tomol|Tomolo'o]]'', the [[Chumash language|Chumash]] word for such a craft, may derive from ''kumula'au'', the Hawaiian term for the logs from which shipwrights carve planks to be sewn into canoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/20/MNG9GDBBLG1.DTL Did ancient Polynesians visit California?

If it occurred, this contact left no genetic legacy in California or Hawaii.

=== Claims involving chickens ===
The existence of chicken bones dating from 1321 to 1407 in Chile and thought to be genetically linked to South Pacific Island chicken landraces suggested further evidence of South Pacific contact with South America.

Chicken bones found at the site [[El Arenal, Chile|El Arenal]] in the [[Araucanía (historic region)|Arauco Peninsula]], an area inhabited by Mapuche, support a pre-Columbian introduction of [[Araucana chicken|chicken]] to South America.&lt;ref&gt;Storey et al., p. 10335.&lt;/ref&gt; The bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, before the arrival of the Spanish.

=== Linguistics ===
[[File:Thames Kumara n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sweet potatoes for sale, Thames, New Zealand. The name "kumara" has entered [[New Zealand English]] from [[Māori language|Māori]], and is in wide use.]]

Dutch linguists and specialists in [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] [[Willem Adelaar]] and Pieter Muysken have suggested that two lexical items may be shared by Polynesian languages and languages of South America. One is the name of the [[#Claims involving sweet potato|sweet potato]], which was domesticated in the New World. [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''kumala''&lt;ref name=POLLEX-kumala&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|last3=Biggs|first3=Bruce|title=Entries for KUMALA.1 [LO] Sweet Potato (Ipomoea)|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/kumala1/|work=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Rapa Nui language|Easter Island]] ''kumara'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''ʻuala'',&lt;!--this is correct. an [m] was not dropped.--&gt; [[Māori language|Māori]] ''kumāra''; apparent [[cognate]]s outside [[Eastern Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesian]] may be [[Loanword|borrowed]] from Eastern Polynesian languages, calling Proto-Polynesian status and age into question) may be connected with [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] ''k’umar ~ k’umara''. A possible second is the word for 'stone axe', Easter Island ''toki'', New Zealand Maori ''toki'' 'adze', [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] ''toki'', and further afield, [[Yurumanguí language|Yurumanguí]] ''totoki'' 'axe'. According to Adelaar and Muysken, the similarity in the word for sweet potato "constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the Andean region and the South Pacific", though according to Adelaar and Muysken the word for axe is not as convincing. The authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between Polynesia and South America, but no migrations.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic relations of South American Indian languages".

=== Similarity of features and genetics ===
[[File:Isla Mocha 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mocha Island]] off the coast of [[Arauco Peninsula]], Chile]]
In December 2007, several human skulls  were found  in a museum in [[Concepción, Chile]].  These skulls  originated from [[Mocha Island]], an island just off the coast of Chile in the Pacific Ocean, formerly inhabited by the Mapuche. [[craniometry|Craniometric]] analysis of the skulls, according to [[Lisa Matisoo-Smith]] of the [[University of Otago]] and [[José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga]] of the [[Universidad de Valparaíso]], suggests that the skulls have "[[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] features" – such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, and rocker jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lawler |first1= Andrew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.full |title=Beyond ''Kon-Tiki'': Did Polynesians Sail to South America?|journal=Science|date= June 11, 2010 |pages= 1344–1347 | pmid=20538927 | doi=10.1126/science.328.5984.1344 | volume=328 | issue=5984 |bibcode= 2010Sci...328.1344L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 to 2009, geneticist [[Erik Thorsby]] and colleagues have published two studies in  ''[[Tissue Antigens]]'' that evidence an Amerindian genetic contribution to the Easter Island population, determining that it was probably introduced before European discovery of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00717.x |title= Molecular genetic studies of natives on Easter Island: evidence of an early European and Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool | year = 2007 | last1 = Lie | first1 = B.

In 2014, geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of The Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen published a study in ''[[Current Biology]]'' that found human genetic evidence of contact between the populations of [[Easter Island]] and South America, approximately 600 years ago (i.e. 1400 CE ± 100 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerholm|first1=Russell|title=Easter Island Was Not Populated Solely by the Polynesians, According to New Genetic Study|url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/12415/20141024/easter-island-was-not-populated-solely-by-the-polynesians-according-to-new-genetic-study.htm|website=University Herald|accessdate=2014-12-24|date=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the now extinct [[Aimoré people|Botocudo people]], who lived in the interior of Brazil, were found in research published in 2013 to have been members of [[mtDNA haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)#Tree|B4a1a1]], which is normally found only among Polynesians and other subgroups of [[Austronesian people|Austronesians]]. This was based on an analysis of fourteen skulls. Two belonged to B4a1a1 (while twelve belonged to subclades of mtDNA  [[haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C1]] common among Native Americans). The research team examined various scenarios, none of which they could say for certain were correct. They dismissed a scenario of direct contact in prehistory between Polynesia and Brazil as "too unlikely to be seriously entertained." While B4a1a1 is also found among the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] (which experienced significant Austronesian settlement in prehistory), the authors described as "fanciful" suggestions that B4a1a1 among the Botocudo resulted from  the African slave trade (which included Madagascar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vanessa Faria Gonçalves |author2=Jesper Stenderup |author3=Cláudia Rodrigues-Carvalho |author4=Hilton P.

Other researchers have argued that the [[Olmec]] civilization came into existence with the help of [[China|Chinese]] refugees, particularly at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;This theory is mentioned in the history book [[The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community]] (1963) by [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Betty Meggers]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] argued that the Olmec civilization originated due to Shang Chinese influences around 1200 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Meggers.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 book, Mike Xu, with the aid of Chen Hanping, claimed that [[celt (tool)|celts]] from [[La Venta]] bear Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, ''Origin of the Olmec civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm Dr. Mike Xu's Transpacific website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010802024552/http://www.chinese.tcu.edu/www_chinese3_tcu_edu.htm |date=August 2, 2001 }}, comparing Olmec and Chinese Shang period artifacts.&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims are unsupported by mainstream Mesoamerican researchers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Other claims have been made for early Chinese contact with North America.

In 1882 artifacts identified at the time as Chinese coins were discovered in British Columbia. A contemporary account states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=James|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|date=January 1884|pages=98–99|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=2450831|doi=10.1086/273578|title=Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1882 a miner found on De Foe (Deorse?) creek, Cassiar district, Br. Columbia, thirty Chinese coins in the auriferous sand, twenty-five feet below the surface. They appeared to have been strung, but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart. The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar. So far as I can make out the markings, this is a Chinese chronological cycle of sixty years, invented by [[Yellow Emperor|Emperor Huungti]], 2637 BCE, and circulated in this form to make his people remember it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1885, a vase containing similar discs was also discovered, wrapped in the roots of a tree around 300 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Lily|title=Chasing their dreams : Chinese settlement in the Northwest region of British Columbia = Zhui qun meng xiang|year=2000|publisher=Caitlin Press|location=Prince George, B.C.|isbn=978-0-920576-83-0|chapter=The Gold Fever|chapterurl=http://caitlin-press.com/our-books/chasing-their-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant Keddie, Curator of Archeology at the Royal BC Museum, examined a photograph of a coin from Cassiar taken in the 1940s (whereabouts now unknown) and he believes that the character style and the evidence that it was machine-ground show it to be a 19th-century copy of a [[Ming Dynasty]] temple token.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Washington Indian socio-economics: papers in honor of Angelo Anastasio|year=1984|publisher=Western Washington University|page=172|author=Megan Merry McCormick|editor=Herbert C Taylor and Garland F Grabert|chapter=Chinese Coins and Pre-Columbian Asian Contacts with the Pacific Northwest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 and 1975 doughnut-shaped stones were discovered off the coast of California that resembled stone anchors used by Chinese fishermen. These (sometimes called the ''Palos Verdes stones'') were initially thought to be up to 1500 years old and proof of pre-Columbian contact by Chinese sailors. Later geological investigations showed them to be a local rock known as [[Monterey Formation|Monterey shale]], and they are thought to have been used by Chinese settlers fishing off the coast in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L.

In June 2016, [[Purdue University]] published the results of research on six metal and composite metal artifacts excavated from a late prehistoric archaeological context at [[Cape Espenberg]] on the northern coast of the [[Seward Peninsula]] in [[Alaska]]. Also part of the research team was [[Robert J. Speakman]], of the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the [[University of Georgia]], and [[Victor Mair]], of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The report is the first evidence that metal from Asia reached prehistoric North America before the contact with Europeans, stating that [[X-ray fluorescence]] identified two of these artifacts as smelted industrial alloys with large proportions of tin and lead. The presence of smelted alloys in a prehistoric Inuit context in northwest Alaska was  demonstrated  for the first time and indicates the movement of Eurasian metal across the Bering Strait into North America before sustained contact with Europeans.
{{bquote|This is not a surprise based on oral history and other archaeological finds, and it was just a matter of time before we had a good example of Eurasian metal that had been traded [...] We believe these smelted alloys were made somewhere in Eurasia and traded to Siberia and then traded across the Bering Strait to ancestral {{sic|Inuits}} people, also known as Thule culture, in Alaska. Locally available metal in parts of the Arctic, such as native metal, copper and meteoritic and telluric iron were used by ancient Inuit people for tools and to sometimes indicate status. Two of the Cape Espenberg items that were found – a bead and a buckle — are heavily leaded bronze artifacts. Both are from a house at the site dating to the Late Prehistoric Period, around 1100-1300 AD, which is before sustained European contact in the late 18th century. [...] The belt buckle also is considered an industrial product and is an unprecedented find for this time. It resembles a buckle used as part of a horse harness that would have been used in north-central China during the first six centuries before the Common Era.|author=H.

=== Claims of Japanese contact ===
[[Image:Otokichi.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otokichi]], a Japanese castaway in America in 1834, depicted here in 1849.]]
Smithsonian archaeologist [[Betty Meggers]] wrote that pottery associated with the [[Valdivia culture]] of coastal Ecuador dated to 3000–1500 BCE exhibited similarities to pottery produced during the [[Jōmon period]] in [[Japan]], arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities. Chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as implausible.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia, Jomon Fishermen, and the Nature of the North Pacific: Some Nautical Problems with Meggers, Evans, and Estrada's (1965) Transoceanic Contact Thesis Gordon F. McEwan, D. Bruce Dickson American Antiquity, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Jul. 1978), pp. 362–371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistory of the Americas'' By Stuart J. Fiedel pp 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion has been made that the resemblances (which are not complete) are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay.

Alaskan anthropologist Nancy Yaw Davis claims that the [[Zuni people]] of [[New Mexico]] exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Zuni"&gt;Davis, Nancy Yaw (200). ''The Zuni Enigma''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32230-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-393-32230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zuni language]] is a [[language isolate|linguistic isolate]], and Davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type, [[endemic disease]], and religion. Davis speculates that [[Buddhist]] priests or restless peasants from Japan may have crossed the Pacific in the 13th century, traveled to the [[American Southwest]], and influenced Zuni society.&lt;ref name="Zuni" /&gt;

In the 1890s, lawyer and politician [[James Wickersham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wickersham, James (1892). "Origin of the Indians--The Polynesian Route." ''American Antiquarian'', 16:323-335, partly reprinted in [[William R. Corliss]], ed. (1978) ''Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts'', Glen Arm, Maryland: Sourcebook Project, {{ISBN|0-915554-03-8}} pp. 705-709&lt;/ref&gt; argued that pre-Columbian contact between Japanese sailors and Native Americans was highly probable, given that from the early 17th century to the mid-19th century several dozen Japanese ships were carried from Asia to North America along the powerful [[Kuroshio Current]]s. Such Japanese ships landed from the [[Aleutian Islands]] in the north to [[Mexico]] in the south, carrying a total of 293 persons in the 23 cases where head-counts were given in historical records. In most cases, the Japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels. In 1834 a dismasted, rudderless Japanese ship crashed near [[Cape Flattery]]. Three survivors of the ship were enslaved by [[Makah people|Makahs]] for a period before being rescued by members of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. They were never able to return to their homeland due to Japan's isolationist policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9065|title=Japanese Castaways of 1834: The Three Kichis - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/japanese-retrace-path-history-making-castaways-180-years-later|title=Japanese Retrace Path Of History-Making Castaways, 180 Years Later|last=Banse|first=Tom|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Japanese ship crashed in about 1850 near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Wickersham writes, and the sailors were assimilated into the local Native American population. While admitting there was no definitive proof of pre-Columbian contact between Japanese and North Americans, Wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after Europeans arrived in North America.

The Olmec culture existed from roughly 1200 BCE to 400 BCE.

The [[Solutrean hypothesis]] argues that Europeans migrated to the New World during the [[Paleolithic]] era, circa 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. This hypothesis proposes contact partly on the basis of perceived similarities between the flint tools of the [[Solutrean culture]] in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal (which thrived circa 20,000 to 15,000 BCE), and the [[Clovis culture]] of North America, which developed circa 9000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this study, we identified and completely sequenced 14 mitochondrial DNAs belonging to one extremely rare Native American lineage known as haplogroup C4c. Its age and geographical distribution raise the possibility that C4c marked the Paleo-Indian group(s) that entered North America from Beringia through the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving ancient Roman contact ===

Evidence of contacts with the civilizations of [[Classical Antiquity]]—primarily with the [[Roman Empire]], but sometimes also with other cultures of the age—have been based on isolated archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World. The Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble [[Amphora#Ancient Rome|Roman amphorae]]&lt;ref&gt;http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?type=related&amp;kv=87136&amp;t=objects&lt;/ref&gt; for over 150 years. It has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a Roman wreck, although it has been suggested that they could be 15th or 16th century Spanish olive oil jars.

Romeo Hristov argues that a Roman ship, or the drifting of such a shipwreck to the American shores, is a possible explanation of archaeological finds (like the Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca bearded head) from ancient Rome in America. Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidences of travels from Romans to [[Tenerife]] and [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) on [[Lanzarote|Lanzarote island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hristov|first1=Romeo H.|last2=Genovés T.|first2=Santiago|year=1999|title=Mesoamerica evidence of pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=10|pages=207–213|doi=10.1017/S0956536199102013|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, an Italian botanist, Domenico Casella, suggested that a depiction of a [[pineapple]] was represented among wall paintings of Mediterranean fruits at [[Pompeii]]. According to [[Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski]], this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine [[conifer cone|cone]] from the [[Stone Pine|Umbrella pine tree]], which is native to the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jashemski |first=Wilhelmina |title=The natural history of Pompeii |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-80054-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xfjyTqqR7IC&amp;pg=PA81 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head ====
{{See also|Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head}}

A small [[terracotta]] head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 (in the [[Toluca Valley]], 72 kilometres southwest of [[Mexico City]]) in a burial offering under three intact floors of a [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|pre-colonial]] building dated to between 1476 and 1510. The artifact has been studied by Roman art authority Bernard Andreae, director emeritus of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome, Italy, and Austrian anthropologist [[Robert von Heine-Geldern]], both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small Roman sculptures of the 2nd century. If genuine and if not placed there after 1492 (the pottery found with it dates to between 1476 and 1510)&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. ''The American Discovery of Europe'' University of Illinois Press;  April 16, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-252-03152-6}} p.108&lt;/ref&gt; the find provides evidence for at least a one-time contact between the Old and New Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Hristov and Genovés (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arizona State University|ASU]]'s Michael E. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/"&lt;/ref&gt; John Paddock, a leading Mesoamerican scholar, used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by Hugo Moedano, a student who originally worked on the site. Despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer (García Payón), and Moedano, Smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim. Though he remains skeptical, Smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried Post-classic offering at Calixtlahuaca.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E., "[http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/tval/RomanFigurine.html The 'Roman Figurine' Supposedly Excavated at Calixtlahuaca]".

Henry was the grandfather of [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]], the builder of [[Rosslyn Chapel]] (near [[Edinburgh]], Scotland).

Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that Henry Sinclair travelled to the Americas well before Columbus. In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of the botanist Adrian Dyer, and that Dyer's wife told him that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate.&lt;ref name="THK"/&gt; In fact Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the "maize" and "aloe" were stylized wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turnbull|first1=Michael TRB|title=Rosslyn Chapel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/places/rosslynchapel_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialists in medieval architecture interpret these carvings as stylised depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Oxbrow &amp; I.

Some have conjectured that Columbus was able to persuade the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the Atlantic. Some suggest that Columbus himself visited Canada or Greenland before 1492, because according to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] he wrote he had sailed 100 leagues past an island he called [[Thule]] in 1477. Whether he actually did this and what island he visited, if any, is uncertain. Columbus is thought to have visited [[Bristol]] in 1476.&lt;ref&gt;"It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland." [[Silvio Bedini|Bedini, Silvio A.]] and David Buisseret (1992). ''The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1'', University of Michigan press, republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-13-142670-2}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol was also the port from which [[John Cabot]] sailed in 1497, crewed mostly by Bristol sailors. In a letter of late 1497 or early 1498 the English merchant John Day wrote to Columbus about Cabot's discoveries, saying that land found by Cabot was "discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found 'Brasil' as your lordship knows".&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995) p.222&lt;/ref&gt; There may be records of expeditions from [[Bristol]] to find the "[[Brazil (mythical island)|isle of Brazil]]" in 1480 and 1481.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver, K.A.(1995) ''The Frozen Echo'' Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3161-6}} p.221&lt;/ref&gt; Trade between Bristol and Iceland is well documented from the mid 15th century.

[[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]] records several such legends in his ''General y natural historia de las Indias'' of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. He discusses the then-current story of a Spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to England, and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen. The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land. The ship's pilot, a man called [[Alonso Sánchez]],  and very few others finally made it to Portugal, but all were very ill. Columbus was a good friend of the pilot, and took him to be treated in his own house, and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying. People in Oviedo's time knew this story in several versions, but Oviedo regarded it as myth.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus, Christopher; Cohen, J. M. (translator) (May 5, 1992). ''The Four Voyages'', pp. 27–37.

In 1925, Soren Larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint Danish-Portuguese expedition landed in Newfoundland or Labrador in 1473 and again in 1476. Larsen claimed that [[Didrik Pining]] and [[Hans Pothorst]] served as captains, while [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] and the possibly mythical [[John Scolvus]] served as navigators, accompanied by [[Álvaro Martins]].&lt;ref&gt;Soren, Larsen.

[[File:Saint brendan german manuscript.jpg|thumb|Saint Brendan and the whale. From a 15th-century manuscript.]]
The legend of Saint [[Brendan]], an Irish monk, involves a fantastical journey into the Atlantic Ocean in search of Paradise in the 6th century.  Since the discovery of the New World, various authors have tried to link the Brendan legend with an early discovery of America. In 1977 The voyage was successfully recreated by [[Tim Severin]] using an ancient Irish [[Currach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/16/did-st-brendan-reach-north-america-500-years-before-the-vikings/|title=Did St. Brendan Reach North America 500 Years Before the Vikings? – National Geographic Society (blogs)|first=Andrew|last=Howley|website=voices.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British myth, [[Madoc]] was a prince from Wales who explored the Americas as early as 1170. While most scholars consider this legend to be untrue, it was used as justification for British claims to the Americas, based on the notion of a Briton arriving before other European nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Gwyn A (1979): ''Madoc: The Making of a Myth''.

== Claims of trans-oceanic travel originating from the New World ==

=== Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco ===
[[File:RAMmummy.jpg|right|thumb|The [[mummy]] of [[Ramesses II]]]]

Traces of [[coca]] and [[nicotine]] found in some Egyptian mummies have led to speculation that [[Ancient Egyptians]] may have had contact with the New World. The initial discovery was made by a German [[toxicologist]], Svetlana Balabanova, after examining the mummy of a priestess called [[Henut Taui]]. Follow-up tests of the hair shaft, performed to rule out contamination, gave the same results.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm"&lt;/ref&gt;

A television show reported that examination of numerous [[Sudan|Sudanese]] mummies undertaken by Balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of Henut Taui.&lt;ref name="Curseof"&gt;"Curse of the Cocaine Mummies" written and directed by Sarah Marris. (Producers: Hilary Lawson, Maureen Lemire and narrated by Hilary Kilberg). A TVF Production for Channel Four in association with the Discovery Channel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in China and Europe, as indicated by analysis run on human remains from those respective regions. Balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently, but have since gone extinct.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt; Other explanations include fraud, though curator Alfred Grimm of the Egyptian Museum in [[Munich]] disputes this.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Skeptical of Balabanova's findings, Rosalie David, Keeper of Egyptology at the [[Manchester Museum]], had similar tests performed on samples taken from the Manchester mummy collection and reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample did test positive for nicotine.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Sources of nicotine other than tobacco and sources of cocaine in the Old World are discussed by the British biologist Duncan Edlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=A look at the Evidence for Cocaine in Mummies |publisher=Thehallofmaat.com |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholars remain skeptical, and they do not see this as proof of ancient contact between Africa and the Americas, especially because there may be possible Old World sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=The Stoned Age? |publisher=Hall of Maat |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckland | first1 = P.C. | last2 = Panagiotakopulu | first2 = E | title = Rameses II and the tobacco beetle | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 75 | issue = 549–56| page = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two attempts to replicate Balabanova's finds of cocaine failed, suggesting "that either Balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to cocaine."&lt;ref&gt;Counsell, D. C.,  "Intoxicants in Ancient Egypt? Opium, nymphea, coca, and tobacco," in David, Ann Rosalie, ed. '''Egyptian Mummies and Modern Science''', Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-521-86579-1}} p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

A re-examination in the 1970s of the mummy of [[Ramesses II]] revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen. This became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and was seen as proof of contact between Ancient Egypt and the New World. The investigator, [[Maurice Bucaille]], noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886 the abdomen was left open and that "it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there, since the material could have come from the surrounding environment."&lt;ref&gt;Bucaille, M. ''Mummies of the Pharaohs: Modern Medical Investigations'' NY: St. Martin’s Press pp 186-188&lt;/ref&gt; Following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by Balabanova's research and its mention in a 2000 publication by Rosalie David, a study in the journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies "ignored their post-excavation histories" and pointed out that the mummy of Ramesses II had been moved five times between 1883 and 1975.&lt;ref name="Buckland" /&gt;

=== Icelander DNA finding ===
In 2010 Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir published a genetic study showing that over 350 living Icelanders carried mitochondrial DNA of a new type that is similar to the type found only in Native American and East Asian populations. Using the [[deCODE genetics]] database, Sigríður Sunna determined that the DNA entered the Icelandic population not later than 1700, and likely several centuries earlier.  However Sigríður Sunna also states that "...while a Native American origin seems most likely for [this new haplogroup], an Asian or European origin cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21419|pmid=21069749|title=A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in icelanders: Evidence of pre-columbian contact?|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=144|issue=1|pages=92–9|year=2011|last1=Ebenesersdóttir|first1=Sigríður Sunna|last2=Sigurðsson|first2=Ásgeir|last3=Sánchez-Quinto|first3=Federico|last4=Lalueza-Fox|first4=Carles|last5=Stefánsson|first5=Kári|last6=Helgason|first6=Agnar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norse legends and sagas ===
[[Image:Thorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|thumb|150px|Statue of Thorfinn Karlsefni.]]
In 1009, legends report that Norse explorer [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] abducted two children from [[Markland]], an area on the North American mainland where Norse explorers visited but did not settle. The two children were then taken to Greenland, where they were baptized and taught to speak Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm Eirik the Red's Saga by John Sephton] paragraph 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1420, Danish geographer [[Claudius Clavus Swart]] wrote that he personally had seen "[[pygmies]]" from Greenland who were caught by Norsemen in a small skin boat. Their boat was hung in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]] along with another, longer boat also taken from "pygmies". Clavus Swart's description fits the Inuit and two of their types of boats, the [[kayak]] and the [[umiak]].&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA /&gt; Similarly, the Swedish clergyman [[Olaus Magnus]] wrote in 1505 that he saw in [[Oslo Cathedral]] two leather boats taken decades earlier. According to Olaus, the boats were captured from Greenland pirates by one of the [[Haakon (disambiguation)|Haakons]], which would place the event in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;

In [[Ferdinand Columbus]]'s biography of his father Christopher, he says that in 1477 his father saw in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]] two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat. The bodies and boat were of exotic appearance, and have been suggested to have been [[Inuit]] who had drifted off course.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inuit ===

It has been suggested that the Norse took other indigenous peoples to Europe as slaves over the following centuries, because they are known to have taken Scottish and Irish slaves.&lt;ref name=ADE163&gt;{{cite book |title= The American Discovery of Europe|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |year= 2007 |publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-252-03152-6 |page= 163|url= https://books.google.com/?id=cd8yZn7MfSQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=American+Discovery+of+Europe#v=onepage&amp;q=Nidaros&amp;f=false|accessdate= December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;{{cite book |title= Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |year= 1993|publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-252-06321-3 |pages= 18–21| url= https://books.google.com/?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Trondheim+cathedral+Inuit#v=onepage&amp;q=Trondheim%20cathedral%20Inuit&amp;f=false |accessdate= December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of Inuit coming to Europe under their own power or as captives after 1492. A substantial body of Greenland Inuit folklore first collected in the 19th century told of journeys by boat to [[Akilineq]], here depicted as a rich country across the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In Order to Live Untroubled: Inuit of the Central Arctic, 1550–1940 |last= Fossett|first= Renée |year= 2001 |publisher= University of Manitoba Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-88755-647-0 |pages= 75–77 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=yK7cac_mXGgC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Inuit+in+Europe+Trondheim#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Columbian contact between [[Alaska]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] via the [[subarctic]] [[Aleutian Islands]] would have been conceivable, but the two settlement waves on this archipelago started on the American side and its western continuation, the [[Commander Islands]], remained uninhabited until after [[Vitus Bering|Russian explorers]] encountered the [[Aleut people]] in 1741. There is no genetic or linguistic evidence for earlier contact along this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Peopling of the Aleutians |date=January 13, 2012 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.335.6065.158 |volume=335 |number=6065 |pages=158–161 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/158|bibcode=2012Sci...335..158B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious claims ==
=== 17th-century speculation ===
{{Main article|Ten Lost Tribes}}
In 1650, a British preacher in Norfolk, Thomas Thorowgood, published ''Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm Oliver's Bookshelf, The Premier Web-Site for Early Mormon History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184039/http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1652 [[Hamon L'Estrange|Sir Hamon L'Estrange]], an English author writing on history and theology, published ''Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race'' in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a [[Puritan]] missionary who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mormon teachings ===
[[File:Izapa Stela 5.svg|right|thumb|upright|[[Izapa Stela 5]]]]
{{Main article|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon}}
The [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] published by  founder and leader [[Joseph Smith Jr]] in 1830 at the age of twenty-four, states that some ancient inhabitants of the New World are descendants of Semitic peoples who sailed from the Old World. Mormon groups such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] attempt to study and expand on these ideas. Scientific consensus rejects these claims.

The [[National Geographic Society]], in a 1998 letter to the [[Institute for Religious Research]], stated "Archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere's past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mit.irr.org/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon "National Geographic Society Statement on the Book of Mormon"].  August 12, 1998.  Letter from Julie Crain addressed to Luke Wilson of the Institute for Religious Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LDS scholars hold the view that archaeological study of Book of Mormon claims are not meant to vindicate the literary narrative.  For example, [[Terryl Givens]], professor of English at the University of Richmond, points out that there is a lack of historical accuracy in the Book of Mormon in relation to modern archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref name="Givens2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Givens|first=Terryl|title=The Latter-day Saint Experience i n America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEEkTWyIpZkC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32750-6|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Professor M. Wells Jakeman popularized a belief that the [[Izapa Stela 5]] represents the Book of Mormon prophets Lehi and Nephi's [[tree of life vision]], and was a validation of the historicity of the claims of pre-Columbian settlement in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;*{{aut|Brewer, Stewart W.}}, (1999); [http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=jbms&amp;id=180 "The History of an Idea: The Scene on Stela 5 from Izapa, Mexico, as a Representation of Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life"], (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretations of the carving and its connection to pre-Columbian contact have been disputed.&lt;ref name="Paulson2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paulson|first=Matthew A.|title=Breaking the Mormon Code|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pbi_OfkPhzwC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2000-09-01|publisher=WingSpan Press|isbn=978-1-59594-067-4|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, scholarship on the Book of Mormon has concentrated on cultural parallels rather than "smoking gun" sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lund|first=John|title=MesoAmerica And The Book of Mormon|date=2007-11-22|publisher=Granite Publishing &amp; Distribution|isbn=978-1891114403|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Joseph|title=Exploring the Lands of the Book of Mormon|date=1989-06-15|publisher=S.A.

The '''Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History''' was created by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]] following the Australian History Summit held in [[Canberra]] on 17 August 2006. The Summit looked at how the Australian government could strengthen Australian history in the school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/policy_initiatives_reviews/key_issues/Australian_History/Default.htm Australian History Summit 2006]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903063806/http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/policy_initiatives_reviews/key_issues/Australian_History/Default.htm |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner (or winners) receive a gold medallion and a grant worth [[Australian dollar|A$]]100,000.&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;[http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/policy_initiatives_reviews/key_issues/Australian_History/pm_historyprize.htm Australian History Prize]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827112906/http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/policy_initiatives_reviews/key_issues/Australian_History/pm_historyprize.htm |date=27 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primitive communism''' is a concept originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] who argued that [[hunter-gatherer]] societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Sociology  |last=Scott |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Marshall, Gordon |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-19-860987-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s descriptions of "communism in living" as practised by the [[Iroquois Nation]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, L. H. 1881. ''Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines''. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical [[social class]] structures or [[capital accumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man the Hunter |last=Lee |first=Richard |last2=DeVore |first2=Irven |year=1969 |publisher=Aldine Transaction |isbn=978-0-202-33032-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engels offered the first detailed theorization of primitive communism in 1884, with publication of  ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]''. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some [[subsistence agriculture]] communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism.

Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of ''primitive communism''. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that ''The Origin of the Family'' was published, Engels attacked [[European colonialism]], describing the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch regime]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, "on the basis of the old communistic village communities".&lt;ref&gt;Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]] showed "how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]]".

Both Marx and Engels were heavily influenced by [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s speculative evolutionary history, which described the "liberty, equality and fraternity of the ancient gentes", and the "communism in living" said to be evident in the village architecture of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native Americans]].

In a primitive communist society, all able bodied persons would have engaged in obtaining food, and everyone would share in what was produced by hunting and gathering. There would be no private property, which is distinguished from personal property&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pslweb.org/party/marxism-101/eight-myths-about-socialism.html|title=Eight myths about socialism—and their answers|publisher=Party for Socialism and Liberation|accessdate=Aug 30, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025001338/http://www.pslweb.org/party/marxism-101/eight-myths-about-socialism.html|archivedate=2013-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as articles of clothing and similar personal items, because primitive society produced no surplus; what was produced was quickly consumed.

James (eds.), ''Early Human Kinship''. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61-82.&lt;/ref&gt; There would have been no [[State (polity)|state]].

Domestication of animals and plants following the [[Neolithic Revolution]] through [[herding]] and [[agriculture]] was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to [[class society]] as it was followed by private ownership and [[slavery]], with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, [[culture]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]] which is said to lead to the development of [[social class]]es.&lt;ref name="ablongman" /&gt;

Egalitarian and communist-like hunter gatherer societies have been studied and described by many well-known social anthropologists including James Woodburn,&lt;ref&gt;James Woodburn (1982).

In ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' 14:2: 297-315.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists such as [[Christopher Boehm]],&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, C. 2001. ''Hierarchy in the Forest.

Lewis 2014. "Vocal deception, laughter, and the linguistic significance of reverse dominance". Chapter 21 in D. Dor, C. Knight and J. Lewis (eds), ''The Social Origins of Language''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; offer theoretical accounts to explain how communistic, assertively egalitarian social arrangements might have emerged in the [[prehistory|prehistoric past]]. Despite differences in emphasis, these and other anthropologists follow Engels in arguing that evolutionary change—resistance to primate-style sexual and political dominance—culminated eventually in a revolutionary transition. [[Richard Borshay Lee]] criticizes the mainstream and [[dominant culture]]'s long-time bias against the possible existence of primitive communism, deriding "[[Bourgeois]] ideology [that] would have us believe that primitive communism doesn't exist. In popular consciousness it is lumped with romanticism, exoticism: the noble savage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title= ''Richard B. Lee, 1992. "Demystifying Primitive Communism".

'''Rennes-le-Château''' ({{lang-oc|Rènnas del Castèl}}) is a small [[Communes of France|commune]] approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km (3 miles) south of [[Couiza]], in the [[Aude]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Languedoc]] in southern [[France]].

This small French hilltop village is known internationally, and receives tens of thousands of visitors per year, because of various [[conspiracy theories]], about an alleged buried [[treasure]] discovered by its 19th-century priest [[Bérenger Saunière]], the precise nature of which is disputed by those who believe in its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Christiane Amiel entitled "L’abîme au trésor, ou l’or fantôme de Rennes-le-Château" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), ''Imaginaires archéologiques'', pages 61-86 (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: Éditions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme, 2008). {{ISBN|978-2-7351-1210-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountains frame both ends of the region—the [[Cevennes]] to the northeast and the [[Pyrenees]] to the south. The area is known for beautiful scenery, with jagged ridges, deep river canyons and rocky limestone plateaus, with large caves underneath.

Rennes-le-Château was the site of a prehistoric encampment, and later a [[Roman empire|Roman colony]], or at least Roman villa or temple, such as is confirmed to have been built at [[Fa, Aude|Fa]], {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Couiza]], part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], the wealthiest part of Roman [[Gaul]].

Rennes-le-Château was part of [[Septimania]] in the 6th and 7th centuries. It has been claimed that it was once an important Visigothic town, with some 30,000 people living in the city around 500-600&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tree of Life and the Holy Grail: Ancient and Modern Spiritual Paths and the Mystery of Rennes-le-Château|author=Francke, S.|date=2007|publisher=Temple Lodge|isbn=9781902636870|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=2X-fqVYhxfQC|page=4|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail|author1=Lincoln, H.|author2=Baigent, M.|author3=Leigh, R.|date=2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781448183425|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=o96yxrxEMOAC|page=35|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyond.fr/villages/rennes-le-chateau-provence-france.html|title=Rennes-le-Château visit, photos, travel info and hotels, by Provence Beyond|publisher=beyond.fr|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, British archaeologist Bill Putnam and British physicist John Edwin Wood argued that while there may have been a Visigothic town on the site of the present village, it would have had "a population closer to 300 than 30,000".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam &amp; John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-Le-Château: A Mystery Solved'', Sutton Publishing, page 87, Revised Edition, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1050 the [[Counts of Toulouse]] held control over the area, building a castle in Rennes-le-Château around 1002,&lt;ref&gt;Abbé Sabarthès, ''Dictionnaire topographique du Département de l'Aude, comprenant les noms de lieux anciens et modernes'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; though nothing remains above ground of this medieval structure—the present ruin is from the 17th or 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood. ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château: A Mystery Solved'', page 88 (Sutton Publishing Limited, revised paperback edition, 2005). {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several castles in the surrounding Languedoc region were central to the battle between the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Cathars]] at the beginning of the 13th century. Other castles guarded the volatile border with [[Spain]]. Whole communities were wiped out in the campaigns of the Catholic authorities to rid the area of the Cathar [[heretics]], the [[Albigensian Crusades]], and again when [[Huguenot|French Protestants]] fought against the [[French monarchy]] two centuries before the [[French Revolution]].

[[File:Rennes-le-Château-Sainte-Marie-Madeleine-Interieur-Autel.jpg|thumb|left|Altar of Saint Mary Magdalene, it features a [[bas-relief]] of Mary Magdalene. At the bottom of the altar a Latin inscription (once lost, now restored), reads: ''Jesu medela vulnerum Spes una poenitentium Per Magdalenae lacrymas Peccata nostra diluas'', that translates as "Jesus, remedy against all our pains, The only hope for the penitent, Through the tears of Magdalen Thou washest away our sins"]]

The village church dedicated to Saint [[Mary Magdalene]] has been rebuilt several times. The earliest church of which there is any evidence on the site may date to the 8th century. However, this original church was almost certainly in ruins by the 10th or 11th century, when another church was built upon the site—remnants of which can be seen in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] pillared arcades on the north side of the [[apse]]. This survived in poor repair until the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;An architectural report of 1845 reporting that it required extensive repairs.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was renovated by the local priest, [[Bérenger Saunière]]. Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière reveal that the renovation of the church, including works on the presbytery and cemetery, cost 11,605 Francs over a ten-year period between 1887 and 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, ''Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', page 130 (Editions Belisane, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St.Madeleine Inschrift.JPG|thumb|left|Latin inscription ''Terribilis est locus iste'' above church entrance]]

One of the new elements was the Latin inscription ''Terribilis est locus iste'' above the front doors, taken from the Common Dedication of a Church, which translates as: "This is a place of awe"; the rest of the dedication reads "this is God's house, the gate of heaven, and it shall be called the royal court of God." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballyroanparish.ie/parish-information/parish-history Ballyroan Parish History, reference to the Entrance Antiphon from the Common of a Dedication of a Church&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the dedication is above the front doors—the rest inscribed on the arches over the two front doors of the church.

[[File:Asmodis Rennes.JPG|thumb|right|The figure of a Devil supporting the Holy Water Stoup.]]

Inside the church, one of the added figures was of a [[devil]] holding up the [[stoup|holy water stoup]]. Its original head was stolen in 1996 and has never been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Midi Libre]]'', 23 April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A devil like figure holding up the holy water stoup is a rare and unusual choice for the interior decoration of a Church but not exclusive to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene; a similar subject matter can be seen in the Saint Vincent [[Collegiate church]] in [[Montréal, Aude|Montréal]], a short distance from Rennes-le-Château.

The new figures and statues were not made especially for this church,&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam &amp; John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, a Mystery Solved'', page 167, new revised paperback edition 2005 {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were chosen by Saunière from a catalogue published by Giscard, sculptor and painter in [[Toulouse]] who, among other things, offered statues and sculptures for church refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;Marie de Saint-Gély, ''Bérenger Saunière, prêtre Rennes-le-Château 1885–1917'' (Bélisane, 1989; 2005), p. XLII, XLIV and XLV, which has reproduced pages from the Giscard catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rennes-le-chateau-archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rennes-le-chateau-archive.com/images/giscard_catalogue/large/catalogue_giscard_1914.pdf |title=Downloadable Giscard &amp; Co catalogue from 1914 |publisher=rennes-le-chateau-archive.com|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunière also funded the construction of the Tour Magdala, a tower-like structure originally named the Tour de L'horloge and later renamed after Saint Mary Magdalene. Saunière used it as his library. The structure includes a circular [[turret]] with twelve [[crenellation]]s, on a [[belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] that connected it to an [[orangery]]. The tower has a promenade linking it to the [[Villa Bethania]], which was not actually used by the priest. He stated at his trial that it was intended as a home for retired priests.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, ''Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', Editions Belisane (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière reveal that the construction of his estate (including the purchases of land) between 1898 and 1905 cost 26,417 Francs.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, ''Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', page 175 (Editions Belisane, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sauniere's renovations and redecoratations, the church was re-dedicated in 1897 by his bishop, [[Monsignor Billard]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château, Editions Belisane (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Cahiers de Rennes-le-Château'' N°11, Abbé Bruno De Monts, "Le Vrai Trésor" (Editions Bélisane, 1996 {{ISBN|2-910730-12-3}}), p. 14; 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910–1911, Bérenger Saunière was summoned by the bishopric to appear before an ecclesiastical trial to face charges of [[simony|trafficking in masses]]. He was found guilty and suspended of the priesthood. When asked to produce his account books, he refused to attend his trial.

Believers in the enigma have suggested that Saunière's estate was set up on a large-scale checkerboard,&lt;ref&gt;Alain Féral, editor, ''Rennes-le-Château: Clef du Royaume des Morts'', Éditions Bélisane, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; while others have claimed that Saunière produced a [[Mirror image]] of selected architectural features of his property. They also allege that [[Maurice Barrès]]'s novels [[Roman à clef]] and [[The Sacred Hill]]&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''L'Or de Rennes'', page 57 (René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; are largely based on the Rennes-le-Château story involving Bérenger Saunière (while novels by [[Jules Verne]] are cited to show that the enigma predates Abbé Saunière).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lamy, ''The Secret Message of Jules Verne, Decoding His Masonic, Rosicrucian, and Occult Writings'', pages 137-138, Inner Traditions, 2007. {{ISBN|9781594771613}}. Translation from the French first published 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern fame==
The village received up to around 100,000 tourists each year at the height of popularity of [[Dan Brown]]'s bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref name="Brown 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Dan|title=The da Vinci Code|date=2004|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0385513755|edition=Special Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern reputation of Rennes-le-Château rises mainly from claims and stories dating from the mid-1950s concerning the local 19th-century priest Father Bérenger Saunière. These stories influenced the authors of the worldwide bestseller ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' in 1982, and that work in turn influenced Dan Brown when he wrote ''The Da Vinci Code'', published in 2003.

The first known popular article about Father Bérenger Saunière was written by Roger Crouquet in the Belgian magazine ''Le Soir illustré'', published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Crouquet, ''Visite a une ville morte: Rennes-le-Château, autrefois Capitale du Comte de Razès, Aujourd'hui bourgade abandonne'' ("Visit to a dead village: Rennes-le-Château, former capital of the [[county of Razès]], now an abandoned village"), in ''Le Soir illustré'', pages 16-22 (number 819; March, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;  The author was visiting the Aude to meet his friend Monsieur Jean Mauhin, who originated from Belgium and had moved to [[Quillan]] to open a factory making bells and hats, and at his suggestion decided it would be a good idea to visit Rennes-le-Château. There Crouquet collected the testimonies of the villagers about Saunière. One person told how the priest "preferred wine and women to practising the priesthood. At the end of the last century he had a rather original idea. He placed in foreign newspapers, especially in the United States, an advertisement announcing that the poor priest of Rennes-le-Château lived among heretics and had only the most meagre of resources. He moved the Christians of the whole world to such pity by announcing that the old church, an architectural gem, was heading for unavoidable destruction if urgent restoration work was not undertaken as soon as possible." Crouquet also added: "The stoup which decorates the entrance to the chapel is carried by a horned devil with cloven hooves. An old woman remarked to us: 'It's the old priest, changed  into a devil'."

Crouquet's article faded into obscurity and it was left to [[Noël Corbu]], a local man who had opened a restaurant in Saunière's former estate (called ''L'Hotel de la Tour'') in the mid-1950s, to turn the village into a household name. Corbu began circulating stories that Father Saunière had discovered "parchments" while renovating his church in 1892 that were to do with the treasure of [[Blanche of Castile]], and which "according to the archives" consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche de Castile to pay the ransom of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis IX]], a prisoner of the infidels, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had only found one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Salamon, ''D'un coup de pioche dans un pilier du maître-autel, l'abbé Saunière met à jour le trésor de Blanche de Castille'' ("With one blow of the pick-axe in a pillar of the main altar Abbé Saunière uncovered the treasure of Blanche de Castile"), in ''La Dépêche du Midi'' dated 12, 13, 14 January 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbu also claimed that Rennes-le-Château was the capital of the Visigoths called ''Rhedae'', but this was another exaggeration: it was [[Narbonne]] that held that position. His claim can be traced back to a book by Louis Fédié entitled ''Le comté de Razès et le diocèse d'Alet'' (1880), that contained a chapter on the history of Rennes-le-Château; published as a booklet in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fédié, ''Rhedae, la Cité des Chariots'' (Rennes-le-Château: Terre de Rhedae, 1994). {{ISBN|2-9506938-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noël Corbu incorporated this story into his essay ''L'histoire de Rennes-le-Château'' that was deposited at the Departmental Archives at [[Carcassonne]] on 14 June 1962. Fédié's assertions concerning the population and importance of Rennes-le-Château have since been contradicted by archaeology and the work of more recent historians.&lt;ref name="PutnamWood-p88"&gt;Bill Putnam &amp; John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, a Mystery Solved'', page 88, new revised paperback edition 2005 {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Fourié, ''Rennes-le-Château: L’Histoire de Rennes-le-Château antérieure à 1789, Notes Historiques'', Editions Jean Bardou, Esperaza, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbu's story was published in the book by Robert Charroux ''Trésors du monde'' in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charroux, ''Trésors du monde: enterrés, emmurés, engloutis'' (Paris: Fayard, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; that caught the attention of [[Pierre Plantard]], who decided to use and adapt Corbu's story for his own gain involving the mythological history of the [[Priory of Sion]], that inspired the 1967 book ''L'Or de Rennes'' by author [[Gérard de Sède]].&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, '' L'Or de Rennes, ou La Vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château'' (René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Sède's book contained reproductions of "parchments" allegedly discovered by the priest Bérenger Saunière alluding to the survival of the line of [[Dagobert II]], from which Plantard claimed to descent. Plantard and Sède fell out over book royalties and [[Philippe de Chérisey]], Plantard's friend, revealed to have forged the parchments as part of the plot. At the same time, Plantard and Chérisey were also involved in planting fabricated documents in France's [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] that dealt with the secret history of the Priory of Sion.&lt;ref name="PutnamWood-p88" /&gt;

Corbu's story inspired author [[Robert Charroux]] to develop an active interest, and in 1958, with his wife Yvette and other members of The Treasure Seekers' Club that he founded in 1951, scanned the village and its church looking for treasure using a [[metal detector]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charroux described his activities in Rennes-le-Château in his 1962 book ''Trésors du Monde enterrées, emmurés, engloutis'' (Fayard), that was published in English in 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Henry Lincoln]], a British [[supporting actor]] and screenwriter for the [[BBC]], read Gérard de Sède's book while on holiday in the [[Cévennes]].He produced three [[BBC2]] [[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]] documentaries between 1972 and 1979 and worked some of its material into the 1982 non-fictional bestseller, ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', that he co-wrote with [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]].&lt;ref name="Baigent Leigh Lincoln 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baigent|first1=Michael|last2=Leigh|first2=Richard|last3=Lincoln|first3=Henry|title=Holy Blood, Holy Grail|date=1982|publisher=Delacorte Press &amp; Jonathan Cape|location=New York &amp; London|isbn=0440036623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book alleged that the Priory of Sion guarded the [[Merovingian dynasty]]'s bloodline, that the dynasty descended from a supposed marriage of [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] and that Pierre Plantard was a modern-day descendant; Bérenger Saunière allegedly discovered that secret and amasses his wealth by  blackmailing of the [[Holy See]].

The blood-line hypotheses of Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh were later picked up in 2003 by Dan Brown's bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. Brown's novel never specifically mentioned Rennes-le-Château, but some key characters in the book had related names, such as Saunière, named after the priest, and "Leigh Teabing", whose name was derived from Richard Leigh and Michael Baigent. The two authors brought (and lost) a plagiarism suit against Brown in 2006. The extraordinary popularity of ''The Da Vinci Code'' reignited the interest of tourists, who come to the village to see sites associated with Saunière and Rennes-le-Château.

==Excavations==
The sudden interest in Saunière's church generated by the stories circulated by Noël Corbu in the 1950s inspired two excavations of the church of St Mary Magdalene. The first was conducted by Dr André Malacan in May 1956, who, after excavating the subsoil of the church at the depth of approximately one metre, discovered some bones that included a skull bearing an incision, but they failed to discover "anything of any interest".&lt;ref&gt;Descadeillas, ''Mythologie du Trésor de Rennes'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Malacan died in 1997, and the skull remained in the possession of his family until May 2014, when it was finally handed back to the village following several years of legal wrangling&lt;ref&gt;''L'Indépendant'', 31 May 2010; ''La Dépêche du Midi'', 19 May 2010; 4 June 2010; 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;(carbon-dating of the skull has dated it to between 1281 and 1396).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/07/06/2138918-le-crane-perce-livre-son-mystere.html ''La Dépêche du Midi'', 6 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1959 and 1963, Jacques Cholet, an engineer from Paris, also conducted several digs in the church, and also failed to discover anything of interest.&lt;ref name="renneslechateau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renneslechateau.com/anglais/rapport-cholet.htm |title=Rennes-le-Château, The Cholet Report (a translation of his Report dated 25 April 1967) |author=Atelier Empreinte 1997-2005|publisher=renneslechateau.com|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1956, Monsieur Cotte of the ''Société des arts et des sciences de Carcassonne'' asked the membership during its monthly session about the treasure of Rennes-le-Château, which led to an investigation of the subject matter. Two members conducted on-the-spot research in March 1957 that lasted for one year. Local historian René Descadeillas commented: "They found no evidence anywhere to support the assertion that, down the ages, any individual, family, group or clan could have accumulated a precious treasure-hoard at Rennes and then concealed it in the locality or its environs. What is more, the activities of the Abbé Saunière were undoubtedly eloquent of the sort of stratagems that he was accustomed to using in order to enrich himself."&lt;ref&gt;René Descadeillas, ''Mythologie du Trésor de Rennes'', pages 57-58 (Éditions Collot, 1991 reprint of the 1974 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, a much-publicised 2003 excavation of the floor of the Tour Magdala by the Mayor of the village produced a stone, and not any anticipated treasure,&lt;ref name="ladepeche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2003/08/21/142616-Il-n-y-a-rien-sous-la-tour-Magdala.html |title=''La Dépêche'' 21 August 2003 |publisher=ladepeche.fr|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  following-up claims made by a Canadian who said he was related to one of the foremen who supervised Saunière's works. Another request, at the same time, was also made to excavate the church, but permission was refused by the ''[[Direction régionale des affaires culturelles|Directions Régionales des Affaires Culturelles]]'' (or DRAC), the archaeological body of France.

==Conspiracy theories==
The entire area around Rennes-le-Château became the focus of sensational claims in the 1950s and 1960s involving Blanche of Castile, the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]],&lt;ref name="Gardner 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Laurence|title=The Grail enigma|date=2008|publisher=Harper Element|location=London|isbn=0 00 726694 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], the treasures of the [[Temple of Solomon]] that was the booty of the [[Visigoths]] that included the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] (the seven-branched candlestick from the Temple of Jerusalem). From the 1970s onwards claims have extended to the [[Priory of Sion]], the [[Rex Deus]], the [[Holy Grail]],&lt;ref name="Phillips 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Graham|title=The search for the Grail|date=1995|publisher=Century|location=London|isbn=0 7126 7533 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ley line]]s, [[sacred geometry]] alignments, the remains of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name="A&amp;S 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Richard|last2=Schellenberger|first2=Paul|title=The Tomb of God|date=1996|publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co|location=Boston, New York, Toronto, London|isbn=0-316-04275-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged references to Mary Magdalene settling in the south of France,&lt;ref name="Phillips 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Graham|title=The Marian conspiracy|date=2000|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson|location=London|isbn=0 283 06341 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[flying saucer]]s. Well-known French authors like [[Jules Verne]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lamy, ''Jules Verne, initié et initiateur: la clé du secret de Rennes-le-Château et le trésor des rois de France'' (Paris: Payot, 1984). {{ISBN|2-228-85020-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Leblanc]]&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Ferté, '' Arsène Lupin, supérieur inconnu: arcanes, filigranes et cryptogrammes, la clé de l'oeuvre codée de Maurice Leblanc'' (Paris: Éditions Guy Trédaniel, 1992). {{ISBN|2-85707-463-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; are suspected of leaving clues in their novels about their knowledge of the "mystery" of Rennes-le-Château.

Christiane Amiel has commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No new theory has ever succeeded in entirely replacing any of the previous ones and, as the researches have intensified, so the various lines of investigation have accumulated and crossed in a system of ramifications in which criticism of one line of approach simply gives rise to others&lt;ref name=Amiel&gt;Christiane Amiel, "L’abîme au trésor, ou l’or fantôme de Rennes-le-Château" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), ''Imaginaires archéologiques'' (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: Éditions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme, 2008). {{ISBN|978-2-7351-1210-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today the vogue is for analysing and checking the most minute details, for comparing and contrasting rival theories, for reviving old and unexplored lines of enquiry in a new guise, and for an unbridled pluralism which mixes together erudition and extrapolation, and makes recourse to geology, history, prehistory, esotericism, religious history, mysticism, the paranormal, ufology and other fields.&lt;ref name=Amiel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rennes-le-Château conspiracy theories continue to be a popular ingredient in a publishing industry that is growing exponentially, and is the subject of press articles, radio and television  programmes and films. Websites and blogs devoted to the alleged 'mysteries' exist in many different countries and authors' interviews can be accessed on [[podcast]]s.

===Criticism===
Archaeologist [[Paul Bahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artandmind.org/pages/Biog/BahnPaul.htm |title=Bahn, Dr. Paul |last1=Kennard |first1=Garry |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |website=Art and Mind |publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406143149/http://www.artandmind.org/pages/Biog/BahnPaul.htm|archivedate=6 April 2012 |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the various claims surrounding the village of Rennes-le-Château as pure myth "so beloved of occultists and 'aficionados' of the Unexplained". He ranks the stories among those of the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[Atlantis]] and [[ancient astronauts]] as a source of "ill-informed and lunatic books".&lt;ref&gt;Paul G Bahn, "The ruins of a mystery" (''Times Literary Supplement'', 29 March 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise another archaeologist Bill Putnam, co-author with John Edwin Wood of ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, A Mystery Solved'' (2003, 2005) has dismissed all of the popular allegations as [[pseudo-history]].

Laura Miller, contributor to ''[[The New York Times]]'' books section, commented how the village of Rennes-le-Château had become "a town that had become the French equivalent of [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]] or [[Loch Ness]] as a result of popular books by Gérard de Sède."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/books/the-last-word-the-da-vinci-con.html |title=THE LAST WORD; The Da Vinci Con |last1=Miller |first1=Laura |last2= |first2= |date=22 February 2004 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Amiel commented in 2008 that the treasure of Rennes-le-Château "seems to elude all the investigations that people make into it. Like the fairy gold which, in the popular fables, turns into manure as soon as a human being touches it, it remains impalpable. It can only exist as long as it remains on the distinctive level of the dream, between the real and the imaginary."&lt;ref&gt;Article by Christiane Amiel entitled "L’abîme au trésor, ou l’or fantôme de Rennes-le-Château" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), ''Imaginaires archéologiques,'' page 84 (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: Éditions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme, 2008). {{ISBN|978-2-7351-1210-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Sobecki is Professor of Medieval English Literature and Culture at the [[University of Groningen]], the oldest chair (founded in 1886) for English literature in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fV3w7EOWUQkC&amp;q=1886#v=snippet&amp;q=1886&amp;f=false|title=One Hundred Years of English Studies in Dutch Universities: Seventeen Papers Read at the Centenary Conference, Groningen, 15-16 January 1986|last=Bunt|first=Gerrit|date=1986|website=|publisher=Rodopi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-09-22|isbn=978-9062037896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also holds by courtesy the Professorship of Old Germanic, established in 1881. Having received his education at the [[University of Cambridge]], Sobecki became an Assistant Professor at [[McGill University]] before being appointed at Groningen. He works on medieval English and early Tudor literature, particularly on Chaucer, Gower, manuscripts, politics, law, travel, and Anglo-European relations. Sobecki was awarded the John Hurt Fisher Prize by the John Gower Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/|title=Department of English, University of Groningen|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcu.edu/johngower/FisherPrize/index.html|title=John Hurt Fisher Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shapell Manuscript Foundation''' '''(SMF)''' is a non-profit independent educational organization dedicated to research and the collection of historical documents and original manuscripts. The Foundation focuses on the histories of the United States and the [[Holy Land]],  with emphasis on the people and events of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|url=http://www.vintageallies.com/General/shapell-manuscript-foundation.html|website=Vintage Allies|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=3 June 2012|quote=The foundation's focus is on the histories of the United States and the Holy Land, with emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

The Shapell Manuscript Collection is a private holding of primary source documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Shapell Family Manuscript Foundation|url=http://cargocollective.com/tairbarkay/Benjamin-Shapell-Family-Manuscript-Foundation|website=Cargo Collective|accessdate=8 July 2014|quote=The Benjamin Shapell Family Manuscript Foundation foundation is a private collection of manuscripts, exploring the jewish and american relationship throughout the years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  relating to various events and historical figures in American, Jewish, and Holy Land history. Included in the Collection are signed documents, photographs and rare books. It is particularly rich with items from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, [[Mark Twain]], [[Albert Einstein]], and many other historical figures.  Among the many noteworthy items are exceptional letters written by [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/article/154714|website=History News Network|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=2-12-14|year=2014|title=Grover Cleveland, Lover?

The Shapell Manuscript Foundation's website offers a large digitized selection of the Collection online for public viewing and research. The online Collection is continuously expanding its offerings of primary source documents and historical artifacts as the digitization process continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection|url=http://www.shapell.org/collection.aspx|website=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Shapell Roster Project==

The Shapell Roster Project is the ongoing research of Jewish Civil War soldiers and their stories.  As part of the Foundation's contribution to the Civil War Sesquicentennial Celebration, the Shapell Manuscript Foundation is preparing a new roster of Jewish Civil War soldiers. The Roster is based on a parallel section in [[Simon Wolf]]'s book, The American Jew as Soldier, Patriot and Citizen, (1895), but uses modern research tools and technology to expand and correct the almost 120-year-old roster.

In addition, the Roster will provide documentation (letters, photographs and official documents) for each soldier discussed in the list. At the completion of the project all information and documents will be available online as well as be available in book form. The Roster is scheduled to be published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sellers|first1=John R.|title=Jewish Participation in the Civil War|url=http://lincolncottage.org/jewish-participation-in-the-civil-war/|publisher=President Lincoln's Cottage|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Shapell Roster|url=http://shapellroster.org/about-the-shapell-roster.html|website=Shapell Roster|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish American Historical Research==
In addition to a general focus on the historic manuscripts of universally recognized world-renowned individuals, the foundation's collection frequently relates to the history of American Jewish life. The collected manuscripts explore such topics as the lives of Jewish soldiers during the American Civil War and other topics which bring light to bear on the role of American Jews on the general society around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Menachem M.

'''The Great Binge''' is a 21st Century neologism, coined by amateur historian Gradus Protus van den Belt, describing the period in history covering roughly 1870 to 1914.&lt;ref name=Maps&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryars|first1=Tim|last2=Harper|first2=Tom|title=A History of the Twentieth Century in 100 Maps|date=December 10, 2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226202501|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5jeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=The+Great+Binge+1870-1914&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XwZyVdbpDMexyATnrYGwBg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is so known because of the widespread use and availability of narcotics such as [[opium]], heroin, [[cocaine]], [[morphine]], and [[absinthe]].&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; During this period these drugs were widely available and incredibly popular among both men and women of many social classes in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; They were marketed to both adults and children, often included in [[patent medicines]] such as cough syrups, pain relievers, and asthma medicines.&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite web|last1=Inglis-Arkell|first1=Esther|title=When Opium Was For Newborns And Bayer Sold Heroin|url=http://io9.com/5896669/when-opium-was-for-newborns-and-bayer-sold-heroin|website=io9|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were administered to infants and women with [[menstrual cramps]], and included in food and beverages such as [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name=io9 /&gt; Literary characters such as [[Sherlock Holmes]] were portrayed using morphine and cocaine.&lt;ref name=Maps /&gt; Holmes is described as having a particular penchant for overt injections of a 7% solution of cocaine - though only when lacking adequate mental stimulation. 

The period ended with a series of laws regulating narcotic drugs in various countries and internationally.  The [[International Opium Convention]], signed in the [[Hague]] in 1912 by 11 countries and entering into force in 1915, was the first stab at a comprehensive drug control treaty internationally and inspired domestic drug control laws such as the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=UNDOC&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1912 Hague International Opium Convention|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/the-1912-hague-international-opium-convention.html|website=U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

‘Binge’ is 19th century slang, although the meaning has evolved. However, the specific application of the term ‘great binge’ relative to drug use and popular attitudes towards drug use circa 1870–1914 is relatively recent. As well as its use by Bryars and Harper cited above, it was used by British author and comedian [[Stephen Fry]] to describe this period in 'More Fool Me'&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Stephen (25 Sept. 2014). More Fool Me. London: Michael Joseph {{ISBN|978-0718179786}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by academic [[Nicholas J. Saunders]] in 'The Poppy: A History of Conflict, Loss, Remembrance, and Redemption',&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Nicholas J. (3 April 2014). The Poppy: A History of Conflict, Loss, Remembrance, and Redemption. Oneworld Publications {{ISBN|978-1780744049}}&lt;/ref&gt; speaking primarily of the USA, to describe a 19th century “characterised by various narcotics that were legal, widely available, widely consumed and deeply embedded in popular culture”. Popular use goes back a little further. [[Esquire Magazine]] used it in this context in 2009:&lt;ref&gt;Esquire. The magazine for men. Vol. 152, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dracula]] “appeared right in the middle of what historians call the Great Binge, a period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when cocaine and heroin use ran rampant”. A Canadian psychologist, Romeo Vitelli, used the term online in a post dated September 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2007/09/ending-the-bing.html Retrieved October 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'''''{{efn|sometimes shortened to '''''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'''''}} is a six-volume work by the English historian [[Edward Gibbon]]. It traces Western civilization (as well as the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic]] and [[Mongolian Empire|Mongolian]] conquests) from the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|height]] of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. Volume&amp;nbsp;I was published in 1776 and went through six printings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Gibbon |author-link=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=I |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aLcWAAAAQAAJ |year=1776 |publisher=W.

Strahan and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=VI |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CSg-AAAAcAAJ |year=1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The original volumes were published in [[quarto]] sections, a common publishing practice of the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

The six volumes cover the history, from 98 to 1590, of the [[Roman Empire]], the history of [[early Christianity]] and then of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman State Church]], and the history of Europe, and discusses the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] among other things.

Gibbon’s work remains a great literary achievement and a very readable introduction to the period, but considerable progress has since been made in history and archaeology, and his interpretations no longer represent current academic knowledge or thought. In [[The World of Late Antiquity (1971)|''The World of Late Antiquity'' (1971)]], [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] offers an alternative interpretation of the period between the second and eighth centuries CE, and ''[[Framing the Early Middle Ages]]'' (2005) by [[Christopher Wickham]] presents hitherto unavailable evidence from both documentary and archaeological sources.

== Thesis ==
Gibbon offers an explanation for the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], a task made difficult by a lack of comprehensive written sources, though he was not the only historian to attempt it.{{efn|See for example [[Henri Pirenne#Pirenne Thesis|Henri Pirenne's (1862–1935) famous thesis]] published in the early 20th century. As for sources more recent than the ancients, Gibbon certainly drew on [[Montesquieu]]'s short essay, [[Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline]], and on previous work published by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (1627–1704) in his ''Histoire universelle à Monseigneur le dauphin'' (1763). see Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764''. for Bousset, pp. 65, 145; for Montesquieu, pp. 85–88, 114, 223.}}

According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to [[barbarian]] invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of [[civic virtue]] among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, "Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian," ''Daedalus'' 105:3 (1976), 153–169; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;  
He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. {{blockquote|The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians. |Edward Gibbon. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter 38 "General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West"}}

Like other [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] citizens of the age steeped in institutional [[anti-Catholicism]], Gibbon held in contempt the [[Medievalism|Middle Ages]] as a priest-ridden, superstitious [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]].  It was not until his own era, the "Age of Reason", with its emphasis on rational thought, it was believed, that human history could resume its progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.G.A. |last=Pocock |year=1976 |title=Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian |journal=Daedalus |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=153–169}}; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

Gibbon's tone was detached, dispassionate, and yet critical. He can lapse into moralisation and [[aphorism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Foster|title=Melancholy Duty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5fcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2013|page=63|isbn=9789401722353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citations and footnotes ===
Gibbon provides the reader with a glimpse of his thought process with extensive notes along the body of the text, a precursor to the modern use of footnotes. Gibbon's footnotes are famous for their idiosyncratic and often humorous style, and have been called "Gibbon's table talk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Saunders |editor-first=Dero A. |title=Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |year=1952 |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |at=page&amp;nbsp;23 (Introduction)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide an entertaining moral commentary on both [[ancient Rome]] and 18th&amp;nbsp;century [[Great Britain]]. This technique enabled Gibbon to compare ancient Rome to his own contemporary world. Gibbon's work advocates a [[rationalist]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] view of history.

Gibbon's citations provide in-depth detail regarding his use of sources for his work, which included documents dating back to ancient Rome. The detail within his asides and his care in noting the importance of each document is a precursor to modern-day historical footnoting methodology.

The work is notable for its erratic but exhaustively documented notes and research. [[J.B. Bury|John Bury]], following him 113&amp;nbsp;years later with his own ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', commended the depth and accuracy of Gibbon's work. Unusually for 18th&amp;nbsp;century historians, Gibbon was not content with second-hand accounts when primary sources were accessible. "I have always endeavoured", Gibbon wrote, "to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |at=page&amp;nbsp;520, Preface to Gibbon's ''Volume the Fourth'' |editor-first=David |editor-last=Womersley |title=Edward Gibbon – The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=2 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Decline and Fall'' is a literary monument and a massive step forward in [[historical method]].{{efn|In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen]] summarized ''The History''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reputation as a work of unmatched erudition, a degree of professional esteem which remains as strong today as it was then:&lt;blockquote&gt;The criticisms upon his book ... are nearly unanimous. In accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and comprehensive grasp of a vast subject, the History is unsurpassable.  It is the one English history which may be regarded as definitive.  ... Whatever its shortcomings, the book is artistically imposing as well as historically unimpeachable as a vast [[panorama]] of a great period.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Sir Leslie |author-last=Stephen |article=Gibbon, Edward (1737–1794) |title=Dictionary of National Biography |volume=7 |publisher=Oxford |year=1921 |page=1134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Numerous tracts were published criticising his work. In response, Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of, ''A Vindication ... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Gibbon| title = A vindication of some passages in the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire: By the author| url = https://books.google.com/?id=tnxbAAAAQAAJ| year = 1779| publisher = Printed for W. Strahan; and T. Cadell, in the Strand.| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks on Christianity aroused particularly vigorous attacks, but in the mid-twentieth century, at least one author claimed that "church historians allow the substantial justness of [Gibbon's] main positions."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', vol. IV, eds. S.M. Jackson, et al. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1952), 483–484. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc04/Page_484.html online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gibbon's views on religion==

===Criticism of Quran and Muhammad===

Gibbon's comments on the [[Quran]] and [[Muhammad]] reflected his view of the secular origin of the text. He outlined in chapter 33 the widespread tale of the [[Seven Sleepers]],&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Iqbal, (2017). “A New Theory on Aṣḥāb al-kahf (The Sleepers of the Cave) Based on Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)”. Al-Bayān – Journal of Qurʾān and ḤadĪth Studies 15 (2017). {{DOI|10.1163/22321969-12340044}}. pp. 20–47. Retrieved from http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22321969-12340044#&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked "This popular tale, which Mahomet might learn when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced, as a divine revelation, into the Quran." His presentation of Muhammad's life again reflected his secular approach: "in his private conduct, Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/volume2/chap50.htm#Private|title=Chapter 50 of 'The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'|first=Edward|last=Gibbon|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Views on Jews and charge of antisemitism===
Gibbon described the Jews as "''a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind''".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire", page 521 in the first volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his view Gibbon has been charged with [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eipa.eu.com/category/information-centre/international-relations/anti-semitism/ | title=Anti-Semitism &amp;#124; EIPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of Christian martyrs===
Gibbon challenged Church history by estimating far smaller numbers of [[Christian martyrs]] than had been traditionally accepted. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. Gibbon, however, knew that modern Church writings were [[secondary source]]s, and he shunned them in favor of [[primary source]]s.

===Christianity as a contributor to the fall and to stability: chapters XV, XVI===
Historian S.P. Foster says that Gibbon:
:blamed the otherworldly preoccupations of Christianity for the decline of the Roman empire, heaped scorn and abuse on the church, and sneered at the entirety of monasticism as a dreary, superstition-ridden enterprise. The ''Decline and Fall'' compares Christianity invidiously with both the pagan religions of Rome and the religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.P. Foster|title=Melancholy Duty: The Hume-Gibbon Attack on Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5fcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date= 2013|publisher=Springer |page=16|isbn=9789401722353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume I was originally published in sections, as was common for large works at the time. The first two were well received and widely praised. The last quarto in Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, was highly controversial, and Gibbon was attacked as a "[[paganism|paganist]]". Gibbon thought that Christianity had hastened the Fall, but also ameliorated the results:

{{quote|As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction, or at least the abuse of Christianity, had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith, zeal, curiosity, and more earthly passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country. Yet party-spirit, however pernicious or absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. The bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their frequent assemblies and perpetual correspondence maintained the communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the Gospel was strengthened, though confirmed, by the spiritual alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the barbarian proselytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors (chap. 38).&lt;ref&gt;General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West. Fall In The West – The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon. At Christian Classics Ethereal Library, Calvin College Computer Science.  http://www.ccel.org/g/gibbon/decline/volume1/chap39.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Voltaire]] was deemed to have influenced Gibbon's claim that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire.  As one pro-Christian commenter put it in 1840:

{{quote|As Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire—arts, science, literature, decay—barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph—and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion—the abominable Manicheism of ''Candide'', and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire's historic school—viz., "that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dublin review: a quarterly and critical journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=1840|publisher=Burns, Oates and Washbourne|pages=208–|quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U2PHcJJoA3dkDDwsI-CJbanilJcVg&amp;ci=104%2C652%2C854%2C302&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;208&amp;nbsp;image] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tolerant paganism===

Gibbon wrote:

{{quote|The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosophers as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful.}} He has been criticized for his portrayal of Paganism as tolerant and Christianity as intolerant. In an article that appeared in 1996 in the journal ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'', H.A. Drake challenges an understanding of [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|religious persecution in ancient Rome]], which he considers to be the "conceptual scheme" that was used by historians to deal with the topic for the last 200 years, and whose most eminent representative is Gibbon. Drake counters:

{{quote|With such deft strokes, Gibbon enters into a conspiracy with his readers: unlike the credulous masses, he and we are cosmopolitans who know the uses of religion as an instrument of social control. So doing, Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims. ... Gibbon covered this embarrassing hole in his argument with an elegant demur. Rather than deny the obvious, he adroitly masked the question by transforming his Roman magistrates into models of Enlightenment rulers—reluctant persecutors, too sophisticated to be themselves religious zealots.}}

==Misinterpretation of Byzantium==
Others such as [[John Julius Norwich]], despite their admiration for his furthering of historical methodology, consider Gibbon's hostile views on the [[Byzantine Empire]] flawed and blame him somewhat for the lack of interest shown in the subject throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Byzantium'' (New York: Knopf, 1989); ''Byzantium: the apogee'' (London and New York: Viking Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This view might well be admitted by Gibbon himself: "But it is not my intention to expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the Byzantine history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/gibbon/decline/files/preface.htm Preface of 1782 online].&lt;/ref&gt; However the Russian historian [[George Ostrogorsky]] writes, "Gibbon and [[Charles le Beau|Lebeau]] were genuine historians—and Gibbon a very great one—and their works, in spite of factual inadequacy, rank high for their presentation of their material."&lt;ref&gt;Georgije Ostrogorski  [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22gibbon+and+lebeau+were+genuine+historians%22&amp;num=10 ''History of the Byzantine State'' (1986) p. 5 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gibbon's reflections==
Gibbon's initial plan was to write a history "''of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome''", and only later expanded his scope to the whole Roman Empire:&lt;blockquote&gt; If I prosecute this ''History'', I shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome; an interesting object, to which my plan was originally confined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=3 |at=chapter&amp;nbsp;36, footnote&amp;nbsp;43 |year=1781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life to this one work (1772–1789). His autobiography [[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon#The Miscellaneous Works|''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'']] is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually ''became'' his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia B. |last=Craddock |title=Edward Gibbon, Luminous Historian |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ. Press |year=1989 |pages=249–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.

Many writers have used variations on the series title (including using "Rise and Fall" in place of "Decline and Fall"), especially when dealing with large nations or empires.  [[Piers Brendon]] notes that Gibbon's work, "became the essential guide for Britons anxious to plot their own imperial trajectory. They found the key to understanding the British Empire in the ruins of Rome."&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781-1997'' (2008) p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, an established journal of classical scholarship, ''Classics Ireland'', published [[Punk rock|punk]] musician's [[Iggy Pop]]'s reflections on the applicability of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' to the modern world in a short article, ''Caesar Lives'', (vol.&amp;nbsp;2, 1995) in which he noted&lt;blockquote&gt;America is Rome. Of course, why shouldn't it be? We are all Roman children, for better or worse ... I learn much about the way our society really works, because the system-origins – military, religious, political, colonial, agricultural, financial – are all there to be scrutinised in their infancy. I have gained perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25528281 |first=Iggy |last=Pop |author-link=Iggy Pop |title=Caesar lives |year=1995 |volume=2 |pages=94–96 |journal=Classics Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following timeline covers European exploration from 1418 to 1957.

The 15th century witnessed the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa, while in the last decade of the century the Spanish sent expeditions to the New World, focusing on exploring the [[Caribbean Sea]], and the Portuguese discovered the sea route to India. In the 16th century, various countries sent exploring parties into the interior of the Americas, as well as to their respective west and east coasts north to California and Labrador and south to Chile and Tierra del Fuego. In the 17th century, the Russians explored and conquered Siberia in search of sables, while the Dutch roughly worked on the chart for Australia. The 18th century saw the first extensive exploration of the South Pacific and the discovery of Alaska, while the nineteenth was dominated by exploration of the polar regions (not to mention excursions into the heart of Africa). By the 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.

Langlois, Traditions: Social, In: Neil J. Smelser and Paul B. Baltes, Editors-in-Chief, ''International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences'', Pergamon, Oxford, 2001, Pages 15829-15833, {{ISBN|978-0-08-043076-8}}, {{doi|10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02028-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional and modern==
Traditional society has often been contrasted with modern [[industrial society]], with figures like [[Durkheim]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]] stressing such polarities as community vs. society or mechanical vs. organic solidarity;&lt;ref&gt;M.Grenfell, ''Pierre Bourdieu: Agent Provocateur'' (2004) p. 41-4&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] saw traditional societies as 'cold' societies in that they refused to allow the historical process to define their social sense of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, ''The Savage Mind'' (1989) p. 233–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Modernization theory|modernisation theory]], traditional society is also the first stage of economic development as established in [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W.W. Rostow]]'s Economic Growth Model. Classified as "pre-newtonian," science and technology are not practiced. Life is agrarian, and family or clan relationships are the basis for social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The Five Stages of Growth."

However, theories positing the simple, [[unilineal evolution]] of societies from traditional to modern industrial are now seen as too simplistic,&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, in Smelser&lt;/ref&gt; relying on an [[ideal type|ideal typology]] revolving round such polarities as subsistence/growth; face-to-face/impersonal; [[informal social control]] or [[formal social control]]; collective ownership/private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csupomona.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/Traditional%20and%20Modern.htm Traditional and Modern Societies] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212140429/http://www.csupomona.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/Traditional%20and%20Modern.htm |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has emphasised instead the variety of traditional cultures, and the existence of intermediate forms as well as of 'alternative' modernisations.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hall et al, ''Sociology on Culture'' (2003) p. 71-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==

Traditional societies have been seen as characterised by powerful collective memories sanctioned by [[ritual]], and with social guardians ensuring continuity of communal practices.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Bech et al, ''Reflexive Modernisation'' (1994) p. 63-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Practice theory]] however has recently emphasised the role of ritual in facilitating change, as well as continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity==

[[Fredric Jameson]] saw 20th century modernisation as encountering two main kinds of traditional society, tribal, as in Africa, and bureaucratic imperial, as in China and India,&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; but a much wider diversity of traditional societies has existed over time.

For most of human existence, small tribes of hunter-gatherers leading an almost static existence formed the only social organisation: where they survived into the 20th century, as in Australia, paintings, songs, myths and rituals&lt;ref&gt;David Attenborough, ''Life on Earth'' (1992) p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; were all used to cement links to a deep-reaching sense of continuity with ancestors and ancestral ways.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 276-80&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of farming some 10,000 years ago led to the development of [[agrarian societies]], whether nomadic or peasant, the latter in particular almost always dominated by a strong sense of traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Within agrarian society, however, a wide diversity still existed. [[Homeric]] Greece  was a society marked by powerful kinship bonds, fixed status and rigidly defined social expectations;&lt;ref&gt;M. I. Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'' (1967) p. 89 and p. 133-4&lt;/ref&gt; with the classical [[polis]], however, though festivals, in [[M. I. Finley]]'s words, still "recreated for their audiences the unbroken web of all life, stretching back over generations of men to the gods",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted J. H Plumb, ''The Death of the Past'' (1969) in p. 24-5&lt;/ref&gt; new and more complex voluntary forms of social and public life balanced traditional society in a new equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;J.Boardman et al eds., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval Europe was an intensely local society of self-perpetuating peasant households,&lt;ref&gt;E. Le Roy Ladurie, ''Montaillou'' (1980) p. 283 and p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; living within a slow moving culture dominated by customary law and by respect for ancient authority&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Southern , ''The Making of the Middle Ages'' (1993) p. 74-5&lt;/ref&gt; and pervaded with an ahistorical political [[mentality]] focused upon the concepts of experience, usage, and law-as-custom.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Hexter, ''On Historians'' (1979) p. 269-71&lt;/ref&gt;
In some villages, you find digging being done as a community. People farm together and when harvesting time comes, they share the harvests. So there is communal work as a means of simplifying work and this earns them security to themselves and their produce. This is witnessed in some parts of Buganda like in Lumanyo, Maddu, Gomba District.

==Enlightenment and post-traditionalism==

Much of the focus of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking was directed at undoing the mindset of traditional society, and replacing a focus upon such concepts as rural, hierarchical, customary or status with one centred on the ideas of urban, egalitarian, progressive or contractual. [[Modernism]] and [[modernity]] continued the process of challenging and overcoming traditional society.&lt;ref&gt;Hardt, p. 264 and p. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Jameson, however, has seen as a defining feature of [[postmodernism]] the global elimination of residual, 'traditional' enclaves, giving it its one-dimensional, temporal nature that is no longer offset by living examples of the past alongside the new.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt, p. 240-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

Global media such as the [[Internet]] have been seen as effective means of recreating traditional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fox, ''Watching the English'' (2004) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; However, a key contrast now with traditional societies as they were is that participation has become voluntary instead of being ascriptive: fixed in space, social stratification and role expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Translatio imperii''''' ([[Latin]] for "transfer of rule") is a [[Historiography|historiographical]] concept, originating in the [[Middle Ages]], in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of an ''[[imperium]]'' that invests supreme power in a singular ruler, an "[[emperor]]" (or sometimes even several emperors, e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] and the Western [[Holy Roman Empire]]). The concept is closely linked to ''[[translatio studii]]'' (the geographic movement of learning). Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (verses 39–40).&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Newsom and Brennan W. Breed, ''Daniel: A Commentary'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[Jacques Le Goff]]&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;Le Goff, Jacques. ''La civilisation de l'Occident médieval''. Paris. 1964; English translation (1988): ''Medieval Civilization'', {{ISBN|0-631-17566-0}} &amp;ndash; "translatio imperii" is discussed in Part II, Chapter VI, section on "Time, eternity and history".&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ''translatio imperii'' concept as "typical" for the Middle Ages for several reasons:
* the idea of linearity of time and history was typical for the Middle Ages;
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea typically also neglected simultaneous developments in other parts of the world (of no importance to medieval Europeans);
* the ''translatio imperii'' idea didn't separate "divine" history from the history of "worldly power": medieval Europeans considered divine (supernatural) and material things as part of the same continuum, which was their reality. Also the causality of one reign necessarily leading to its successor was often detailed by the medieval chroniclers, and is seen as a typical medieval approach.

Each medieval author described the ''translatio imperii'' as a succession leaving the supreme power in the hands of the monarch ruling the region of the author's provenance:
* [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]] (French area, 10th century): Roman Empire → [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian Franks]] → '''[[Saxons]]'''&lt;ref name=latowsky&gt;{{cite book|title=Emperor of the World: Charlemagne and the Construction of Imperial Authority, 800–1229|first=Anne A.|last=Latowsky|publisher=Cornell UP|year=2013|isbn=9780801451485|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto of Freising]] (living in German region): [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] → [[Byzantium]] → [[Franks]] → [[Longobards]] → '''[[Germany|Germans]]''' (=[[Holy Roman Empire]]);
* [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (living in medieval France): [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] → Rome → '''[[Medieval France|France]]'''&lt;ref&gt;De Troyes, Chrétien. ''[[Cligès]]''. Circa 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard de Bury]] (England, 14th century): "Athens" (Greece) → Rome → "Paris" (France) → '''[[England]]'''

Later, continued and reinterpreted by modern and contemporary movements and authors (some known examples):
* [[Fifth Monarchists]] (England, 17th century): [[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → [[Persian Empire|Persians]] → [[Macedonian Empire]] → Rome → '''England''' (and the '''[[British Empire]]''' later)
* [[António Vieira]] (Portugal, 17th century): [[Assyrian Empire|Assyro]]-[[Babylonian Empire|Caldeans (Babylonians)]] → Persians → Greeks → Romans → '''[[Portuguese Empire]]'''
* [[Fernando Pessoa]] (Portugal, 20th century): Greece → Rome → [[Christianity]] → [[Europe]] → '''[[Portugal]]'''

Medieval and Renaissance authors often linked this transfer of power by genealogically attaching a ruling family to an ancient Greek or Trojan hero; this schema was modeled on [[Virgil]]'s use of [[Aeneas]] (a [[Troy|Trojan]] hero) as progenitor of the city of [[Rome]] in his ''[[Aeneid]]''.  Continuing with this tradition, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman authors [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] (in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'') and [[Wace]] (in his ''[[Roman de Brut|Brut]]'') linked the founding of [[Iron Age Britain|Britain]] to the arrival of [[Brutus of Troy]], son of Aeneas.&lt;ref&gt;Bratu, Cristian. "Translatio, autorité et affirmation de soi chez Gaimar, Wace et Benoît de Sainte-Maure." The Medieval Chronicle 8 (2013): 135-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, the French Renaissance author [[Jean Lemaire de Belges]] (in his ''Les Illustrations de Gaule et Singularités de Troie'') linked the founding of Celtic [[Gaul]] to the arrival of the Trojan [[Francus]] (i.e. [[Astyanax]]), the son of [[Hector]]; and of Celtic Germany to the arrival of Bavo, the cousin of [[Priam]]; in this way he established an illustrious genealogy for [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] and [[Charlemagne]] (the legend of Francus would also serve as the basis for [[Ronsard]]'s epic poem, "La Franciade").

== From the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire ==
The cardinal point in the idea of the ''Translatio imperii'' is the link between the Byzantine to the Holy Roman Empire.
*[[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine I]] established [[Constantinople]], a [[New Rome]], as a second capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330.
*After the death of [[Theodosius I|Emperor Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire is permanently divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire).
*With the demise of the Western Empire in 476, the Byzantine Empire remained as the sole Roman Empire.
*Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] married his son [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] to [[Irene of Athens]] on 17 December 768, brought to [[Constantinople]] by the father on 1 November 768. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, [[Constantine VI|Constantine]]. Following the deaths of Constantine V in 775 and Leo IV in 780, Irene became [[regent]] for their nine-year-old son, [[Constantine VI]].
*As early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of Frankish king Charlemagne. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son's wishes. 
*As [[Constantine VI]] approached maturity, the relationship between mother/regent and son/emperor was increasingly strained. In 797 Irene deposed her son, who died soon afterwards.
*Some western authorities considered the Byzantine throne, now occupied by a woman, to be vacant and recognized that Charlemagne, who controlled Italy and many of the cities of the Western Roman Empire, had a valid claim to the imperial name. [[Pope Leo III]], crowned Charlemagne as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 800, an act not recognized by the Byzantine Empire.
*Irene is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], who alone mentions it, the scheme was frustrated by [[Aetios (eunuch)|Aetios]], one of her favourites.&lt;ref&gt;See Garland, p. 89, who explains that Aetios was attempting to usurp power on behalf of his brother Leo.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 802, Empress Irene was deposed by a conspiracy and replaced by [[Nikephoros I]]. She was exiled and died the following year.
* ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'',  a [[peace treaty]] in 803 between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] and [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]], [[Basileus]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].
* Recognition of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Emperor]] ([[Basileus]]) in 812 by Emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] of the Byzantine Empire (crowned on 2 October 811 by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]), after he reopened negotiations with the [[Franks]]. In exchange for that recognition, [[Venice]] was returned to the Byzantine Empire.
* On February 2, 962, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was solemnly crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope John XII]]. Ten days later at a Roman synod, Pope John XII, at Otto's desire, founded the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] and the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], bestowed the [[pallium]] on the [[Archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[Archbishop of Trier]], and confirmed the appointment of [[Ratherius|Rather]] as [[Bishop of Verona]]. The next day, the emperor issued a decree, the famous ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'', in which he confirmed the Roman Church in its possessions, particularly those granted by the [[Donation of Pepin]].

'''Umberto Meoli''' (26 August 1920 &amp;ndash; 17 May 2002)&lt;ref&gt;"Umberto Meoli; Obituary; The Register", in ''[[The Times]]'', May 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] of [[economics]], known as a maverick of the Italian Left who eschewed [[Marxism]] in favour of [[Pragmatism|British pragmatism]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Meoli was born in [[Padua]], one of nineteen brothers; his father was a [[pharmacist]] from a small town near [[Benevento]], and his mother was from Padua.

=== Education ===
In 1940, at age 20, Meoli began his service in the [[Italian Army]] fighting in [[World War II]], and, three years later, with the [[Italian resistance movement|Resistance]] after the [[Armistice with Italy|1943 armistice]] between Italy and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armed forces.  As a result, Meoli was imprisoned by the [[Benito Mussolini]] [[Fascism in Italy|Fascist]] government, and spent several months in the Palazzo Giusti detention center in Padua.&lt;ref&gt;"Umberto Meoli; Obituary; The Register", in ''The Times'', May 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The Palazzo Giusti detention center was notorious for the cruelty of some Fascists in Padua during the [[Italian Social Republic]].  For example, Giovanni Gonelli, a barely [[literate]] jail keeper at Palazzo Giusti in Padua and a member of the [[Banda Carità]], apparently enjoyed dehumanizing his prisoners by refusing their requests for food or blankets.  The sentence of the Appellate Court of 8 January 1946 states that Gonelli would tell prisoners who asked for water to "piss and drink."&lt;ref&gt;A. Robert Lauer, ''[http://clcwebjournal.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb02-1/lauer02.html ''CLCWeb Library of Research and Information. Comparative Literature and Culture: A WWWeb Journal]'', March 2002,  {{ISSN|1481-4374}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no doubt that Meoli experienced such cruelty while imprisoned in Palazzo Giusti, and that this cruelty affected his thoughts.

=== Marriage and children ===
In 1961 Meoli married Rachel Toulmin, an Englishwoman and lecturer at [[University of Padua|Padua University]]. Rachel Toulmin was the younger sister of [[Stephen Toulmin]], a historian and philosopher of science at the [[University of Southern California]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/Toulmin.html |title={title} |access-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104092955/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/Toulmin.html |archive-date=2006-11-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ealc/NEHfaculty.html |title={title} |access-date=2006-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105225229/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/ealc/NEHfaculty.html |archive-date=2006-11-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academia ===
Meoli was briefly a [[Communism|Communist]], and after graduating, he worked for a time in the [[trade union]]s (''[[Camera del Lavoro]]'') in [[Vicenza]], but he was soon at odds with the rigid militancy of organized labor.  He found his vocation in the late 1950s, when he obtained a teaching post at the [[University of Parma]].

It was during his time at ''Camera del Lavoro'' that Meoli became influenced by the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Harry Gordon Johnson]], one of the most active and prolific economists of all time.  Gordon's main research was in the area of [[international trade]], international finance, and monetary policy. In 1961, Meoli made a special journey to the [[University of Manchester]] in [[England]] to meet Johnson. He quickly became a close friend of both [[Philip Walter Sawford Andrews|Philip Andrews]], A former President of the Royal Economic Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2565791|title = Sir Henry Phelps Brown, 1906-1994|journal = The Economic Journal|volume = 108|issue = 448|pages = 757–778|last1 = Hancock|first1 = Keith|last2 = Isaac|first2 = J.

In 1961, Meoli published the first book in steady flow of books, in which would increasingly concentrate on the history of economic thought and ideas.

By 1970, Meoli became Professor of the History of Economic Thought at Camera del Lavoro, and shortly afterwards was invited to occupy a similar chair at the [[University of Venice]].

== Italian academic circles ==
In addition to his [[Chair (official)|chair]] positions, from 1992 to 1998 Umberto Meoli was president of the Italian Association for the History of Economic Thought (''L'Associazione Italiana per la Storia del Pensiero Economico'', AISPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aispe.org/Presidenti.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Meoli always thought of himself as a man of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]].  However, he early became convinced of the unacceptable limitations of [[Marxian economics|Marxist economic theory]], and his books and articles struck many of his leftist colleagues as a kind of [[apostasy]]. Meoli's writings exhibited an ever-growing respect for British pragmatism, and the [[economic liberalism]] of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Alfred Marshall]]. As an example of his unconventional approach, the figure of [[Gustav von Schmoller]] has been highlighted by authors like [[Francesco Traniello]],&lt;ref&gt;http://hal9000.cisi.unito.it/wf/DIPARTIMEN/Storia1/Ricerca/Bollettino/censimento-ricerca-traniello.doc_cvt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; who has indicated the importance that Schmoller, like [[Gustav von Schönberg]], [[Adolph Wagner]] and [[Albert Schäffle]], among others, gave the ethical element of the political Economy, whereas Umberto Meoli associates the figure of Schmoller to those of [[Lujo Brentano]] and [[Karl Bücher]] as the most representative authors of the development of the Economic [[Historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomez Rojo, María E. Denis, Henri, [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php%3Fscript%3Dsci_arttext%26pid%3DS0716-54552000002200036%26lng%3Den%26nrm%3Diso&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=20&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DUmberto%2BMeoli%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26rls%3DGGLG,GGLG:2006-20,GGLG:en '' Histoire de la pensée économique ''], [[Presses Universitaires de France]], Paris, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually seen in Italian academic circles as a maverick and a great [[Anglophile]], Meoli's leftist friends tolerated the irony, largely because Meoli would comment on their dismay with sudden eruptions of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;"Umberto Meoli; Obituary; The Register", in ''The Times'', May 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="420">'''Unwitting testimony''' refers to the unintentional evidence provided by historical sources. They may demonstrate the attitudes of an author, or the culture to which he or she belongs. This term was originally used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Arthur Marwick]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">In [[anthropology]] and [[archaeology]], the '''Urban Revolution''' is the process by which small, kin-based, nonliterate [[agricultural]] [[village]]s were transformed into large, socially complex, urban societies. 
&lt;!-- Origins, Etymology --&gt;
The term "urban revolution" was introduced in the 1930s by [[V. Gordon Childe]], an Australian archaeologist. Childe also coined the term [[Neolithic Revolution]] to describe the earlier process by which [[hunter-gatherer]] societies domesticated crops and animals and began a farming lifestyle. Childe was the first to synthesize and organize the large volume of new archaeological data in the early 20th century in social terms. Whereas previous archaeologists had concentrated on chronology and technology, Childe applied concepts and theories from the social sciences to interpret archaeological finds.
Childe first discussed the Urban Revolution in his 1936 book, ''Man Makes Himself'',&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. Gordon  (1936)  Man Makes Himself. Watts and Co., London.&lt;/ref&gt; and then his 1950 article in the journal ''Town Planning Review''&lt;ref&gt;Childe, V. Gordon  (1950)  The Urban Revolution. Town Planning Review 21:3-17.&lt;/ref&gt; brought the concept to a much larger audience. In that paper, he presented a 10-point model for the changes that characterized the Urban Revolution:

# In point of size the first cities must have been more extensive and more densely populated than any previous settlements.
# In composition and function the urban population already differed from that of any village … full-time specialist craftsmen, transport workers, merchants, officials and priests.
# Each primary producer paid over the tiny surplus he could wring from the soil with his still very limited technical equipment as tithe or tax to an imaginary deity or a divine king who thus concentrated the surplus.
# Truly monumental public buildings not only distinguish each known city from any village but also symbolise the concentration of the social surplus.
# But naturally priests, civil and military leaders and officials absorbed a major share of the concentrated surplus and thus formed a “ruling class”.
# Writing.
# The elaboration of exact and predictive sciences – arithmetic, geometry and astronomy.
# Conceptualized and sophisticated styles 
# Regular “foreign” trade over quite long distances.
# A State organisation based now on residence rather than kinship.

Although sometimes interpreted as a model of the origins of cities and urbanism, Childe's concept in fact describes the transition from agricultural villages to state-level, urban societies. This change, which occurred independently in several parts of the world, is recognized as one of the most significant changes in human [[Sociocultural evolution]].
Although contemporary models for the origins of complex urban societies have progressed beyond Childe's original formulation,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert McC.  (1966)  The Evolution of Urban Society: Early Mesopotamia and Prehispanic Mexico. Aldine, Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;
Johnson, Allen W. and Timothy K. Earle  (2000)  The Evolution of Human Societies: From Foraging Group to Agrarian State. 2nd ed. Stanford University Press, Stanford.&lt;/ref&gt; there is general agreement that he correctly identified one of the most far-reaching social transformations prior to the Industrial Revolution, as well as the major processes involved in the change.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E., “V. Gordon Childe and the Urban Revolution: An Historical Perspective on a Revolution in Urban Studies,” Town Planning Review 80 (2009) 3-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
