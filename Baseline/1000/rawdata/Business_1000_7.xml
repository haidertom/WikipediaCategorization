The '''Association of MBAs''' ('''AMBA''') is a global organisation founded in 1967 which focuses primarily on international business school accreditation and membership.

== Activities ==
Based in London, AMBA is one of the three main global accreditation bodies in business education (see '''[[Triple accreditation|Triple Accreditation]]''') and styles itself as the world's impartial authority on postgraduate management education. It differs from [[AACSB]] in the [[United States|US]] and [[EQUIS]] in [[Brussels]] as it accredits a school's portfolio of postgraduate management programmes but does not accredit undergraduate programmes. AMBA accredits approximately 2% of the world's business schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/business-schools/business-school-search/schools-a-to-z|title=Accredited Business Schools A-Z - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most international of the three organisations having accredited schools headquartered in 54 countries, compared with the 52 for AACSB&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/accreditation/accredited-members|title=AACSB-Accredited Schools|website=www.aacsb.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 38 for EQUIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis/accredited-schools|title=EQUIS Accredited Schools|last=Pergoot|first=Nick|website=www.efmd.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business schools can become associated with AMBA in two ways: by applying for accreditation, or by applying for membership of the '''AMBA Development Network (ADN),''' which confers institutional membership similar to [[EFMD]] or AACSB membership. Schools that cannot meet all of the AMBA accreditation criteria usually join the ADN, which gives them time to prepare for accreditation with support from AMBA and mentoring from an AMBA-accredited school.

All MBA students and alumni of the [[List of institutions accredited by AMBA|257 accredited member schools]] join AMBA as individual members free of charge. AMBA also accredits generalist [[Master of Management|MBM]] programmes and [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] programmes, and admits as members students and graduates thereof.

AMBA's long-serving president until 2017 was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], the founding benefactor of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] in Cambridge, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/president|title=President - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMBA's current Chief Executive is '''Andrew Main Wilson''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/chief-executive|title=Chief Executive - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who joined the organisation from the [[Institute of Directors]] in 2013. '''Bodo Schlegelmilch''' was elected Chairman of the AMBA Board of Trustees in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbaworld.com/about-us/our-people/board-of-trustees|title=Board of Trustees - Association of MBAs|website=Association of MBAs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Association of MBAs was founded in 1967 as an MBA alumni club by eight [[UK]] graduates from [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School|Wharton]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Stanford]] and [[Columbia Business School|Columbia]], and two graduates from the first intake of [[London Business School]]. The founders saw a lack of awareness in [[Europe]] of the value of the MBA degree, which at that time was primarily an American qualification. They decided to form a lobby and membership group to promote the benefits of postgraduate business education, under the name of Business Graduates Association (BGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's development helped shape the growth of management education in Europe and the UK and coincided with the setting up and growth of [[London Business School]] and [[Manchester Business School]] in Britain.

The Association's first Director General was Vice-Admiral [[David Clutterbuck]] who assumed this position in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Association of MBAs fabulous at forty, Ambition, January 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425045432/http://www.mbaworld.com:81/MBAWorld/jsp/images/knowledge/Ambition_newsletter_jan07_pdf_version.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 BGA began to accredit the growing number of [[MBA]] programmes, while preserving its functions as a membership organization. BGA was renamed Association of MBAs in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbaworld.com/aboutus/ourhis1&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2017, AMBA's president was the late [[Paul Judge|Sir Paul Judge]], who helped establish one of the two business schools in Cambridge, UK.

== Activities ==
=== Accreditation ===
[[File:Scope of business school accreditation for the three main global accrediting bodies AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.png|thumb|400px|Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA]]The Association of MBAs accredits MBA, MBM and DBA degree programmes. When a school  applies for accreditation for its MBA programmes, AMBA requires that the entire portfolio of MBA programmes be put up for consideration and will award accreditation only if all programmes meet its criteria (though the school pays the same fee regardless of the number of programmes being reviewed).

The Association's process of accrediting a school's MBA programmes portfolio includes reviewing compliance AMBA's criteria, most of them qualitative rather than quantitative. The criteria fall into seven dimensions: history and development of the institution; facilities and libraries; teaching faculty, teaching standards and research track record; programme administration, career and alumni services; student admission standards, diversity and cohort size; curriculum content, programme mode and duration; and learning outcomes.

Some of the key AMBA criteria for the accreditation of an MBA programme include:
* all admitted students should have at least three years of full-time post-graduation work experience upon the start of the MBA course (''a criterion which the vast majority of the top US business schools cannot meet as US MBA programmes sometimes admit applicants with only a bachelor's degree and no work experience'');
* a new school applying for accreditation should have a track record of at least three years of graduating MBA students before it can be accredited;
* an MBA programme should have a cohort size of at least 20 students;
* at least 50% of the faculty of an MBA programme (including visiting faculty as part of the total) are expected to have PhD degrees; and
* a full-time MBA curriculum should contain no less than 500 contact (scheduled faculty-mediated) hours and a distance-learning MBA programme should have no less than 120 synchronous contact hours.

===  Events ===
AMBA holds three annual conferences for business school deans and directors:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbaworld.com/bschoolevents Events for business schools - Association of MBAs]. Mbaworld.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; a Global Conference, an Asia Pacific Conference, and a Latin America Conference. Participation is open to both accredited and non-accredited schools. AMBA also hosts an annual Gala Dinner in London, which is open only to accredited schools.

AMBA organises two annual global forums with the purpose of development and training for specific functions within AMBA-accredited business schools such as accreditation managers; programme managers; marketing, admissions, alumni and development staff.

AMBA also organises webinars, lectures and networking events on a regular basis catering to MBA alumni, current MBA students, prospective MBA students and business school admissions departments. These on-campus events are held at accredited business schools and often feature distinguished speakers and practitioners in fields such as leadership, entrepreneurship and innovation.

'''Bill of IT''' is an exhaustive list of IT [[asset]]s and services owned by a company. The bill displays a breakdown of all the IT assets and services in relation to various items.The bill is often used by companies as a [[IT chargeback and showback|chargeback and showback]] tool because it shows the relation between specific service/asset and employee, cost center, department, location, line of business, etc. It allows companies to see what they own and how their resources are allocated in the organizations. Most bills of IT show the following element (among other details):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cimpl.com/what-is-a-bill-of-it-and-why-is-it-important|title=What is a Bill of IT and Why is it Important?|last=Cheang|first=Henry|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cost - What each asset/service cost (price per unit)
* Price- The price of each service/asset multiply by the quantity of service/asset (predefined unit rate)
* Budget -The full budget (cost) associated with the use of this service/asset for a year or any chosen reporting period
* Quality -The quality of the service/asset is shown through various metrics: uptime, response time (with support), etc.
* Benchmarking - Comparison of this service/asset to the company’s benchmarks (use, efficiency, etc.)

Ultimately, the goal of a bill of IT is to clarify IT investments in an organization by presenting a detailed view of IT expenses.

*'''Visual editing''': allowing editing without any knowledge of wiki code (WYSIWYG). This makes creating tables, and uploading and inserting pictures easier than with MediaWiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bailey | first = Matt | title = BlueSpice (fixing MediaWiki) | publisher = Nerdnuts.com | date = 12 September 2013 | url = http://www.nerdnuts.com/2013/09/bluespice-fixing-mediawiki/ | accessdate = 18 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Search and navigation''': An extended search ([[Elasticsearch]]) offers improved search functionalities, like [[faceted search]]. The search results can further be sorted or filtered by category, namespace, author, semantic data, data type etc. Any files attached are also searched. It also provides common features like [[autocomplete]] and [[Incremental search|search as you type]]. The navigation in the wiki is individually customizable via the Dashboard or a UserSidebar.
*'''Quality assurance and review tools''' (workflow tool, reminder e.a.): Pages for instance can be assigned to a reviewer. This allows articles to be reviewed and approved.

==Technology==
BlueSpice is written in the [[PHP]] programming language and uses [[MySQL]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]/IIS, [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] (optional). The editions can be installed on top of an existing MediaWiki installation or as a standalone installation that includes MediaWiki.

The distribution is a collection of extensions, which can be extended with user-specific features or skins. While every single extension can be deactivated, BlueSpice editions integrate and standardize extensions to improve the user experience and maintenance.

==Licensing==
According to the MediaWiki standard all extensions are published under the GPLv3 license.

==History==
The German company Hallo Welt! has been working on developing the open source wiki software BlueSpice since 2007. The project was originally initiated by IBM ("bluepedia"), who wanted to deploy MediaWiki but was unable to live with its downsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eckenfels  | first = Mela | title = Spicy: BlueSpice for MediaWiki | journal = Linux Magazine | issue = 132 | pages = 28–31 | publisher = Linux New Media | location = Munich | date = November 2011 | url = http://www.medialinx-shop.com/magazines/linux-magazine-linux-pro-magazine/back-issues/eh30132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hallo Welt! decided to publish their wiki as free [[Open-source software|Open source]] software. The stable version of BlueSpice for MediaWiki was released July 4, 2011.&lt;ref name="Eckenfels"&gt;Eckenfels, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, a free download has been available at [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluespice/files |title = Download BlueSpice|publisher=Soureceforge.net |accessdate = 2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release of BlueSpice was a couple of extensions and is today a complete stand-alone distribution, which has the latest MediaWiki as a core system but offers in the free version more than 50 distinct extensions and a completely different user interface. Following independent sources the BlueSpice free distribution is one of the most popular wiki software for knowledge management in organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Figura | first = Maria |author2=Gross, Daphne | title = Die Qual der Wiki-Wahl. Wikis für Wissensmanagement in Organisationen  | publisher = Pumacy Technologies AG | date = 13 June 2013 | url = http://www.pumacy.de/publikationen/wikis_fuer_wissensmanagement.html | accessdate = 18 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2013, Hallo Welt! released the completely reworked version BlueSpice 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huber | first = Mathias  | title = Blue Spice 2: Enterprise-Wiki generalüberholt | publisher = Linux Magazin | date = 27 November 2013 | url = http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Blue-Spice-2-Enterprise-Wiki-generalueberholt | accessdate = 18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BlueSpice developers this release aims for opening up BlueSpice for freelance developers in the global MediaWiki community, and lays the foundation for many new language versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Heigl | first = Richard  |  title = BlueSpice 2: The new version coming up later this year! | publisher = BlueSpice News | date = 4 September 2013 | url = http://blog.bluespice.com/2013/09/04/bluespice-2-the-new-version-coming-up-later-this-year/ | accessdate = 18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, BlueSpice for MediaWiki became a project of [[Translatewiki.net]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Muggli | first = Stephan  | title = Translatewiki.net: BlueSpice for MediaWiki project | publisher = BlueSpice News | date = 9 December 2014 | url = https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Category:BlueSpice | accessdate = 9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2015 the developers announced that they will change to a subscription model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.bluespice.com/2015/02/03/a-new-model-for-bluespice/ |title = New model for BlueSpice|publisher=blog.bluespice.com |accessdate = 2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8023">'''Business intelligence software''' is a type of [[application software]] designed to retrieve, analyze, transform and report data for [[business intelligence]].  The applications generally read data that has been previously stored, often - though not necessarily - in a [[data warehouse]] or [[data mart]].

==History==
===Development of business intelligence software===
The first comprehensive business intelligence systems were developed by [[IBM]] and [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]] (currently acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) in the period between 1970 and 1990.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =History of Business Intelligence Software| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''business-intelligence.financesonline.com''| date =| url =https://business-intelligence.financesonline.com/#history | accessdate =28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =A Detailed Look At The History Of Business Intelligence Software| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''comparecamp.com''| date =| url =http://comparecamp.com/detailed-look-history-business-intelligence-software | accessdate =28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, small developer teams were emerging with attractive ideas, and pushing out some of the products companies still use nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/us/support/licensecodes/siebel/siebel-crm-bi-integration-166917.html "Integrating Oracle Business Intelligence / Siebel Analytics with Siebel CRM"], ''oracle.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, specialists and vendors organized a Multiway Data Analysis Consortium in [[Rome]], where they considered making data management and analytics more efficient, and foremost available to smaller and financially restricted businesses. By 2000, there were many professional reporting systems and analytic programs, some owned by top performing software producers in the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470238004.fmatter/pdf "Applied Multiway Data Analysis"], ''onlinelibrary.wiley.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud-hosted business intelligence software===
In the years after 2000, business intelligence software producers became interested in producing universally applicable BI systems which don’t require expensive installation, and could hence be considered by smaller and midmarket businesses which could not afford on premise maintenance. These aspirations emerged in parallel with the cloud hosting trend, which is how most vendors came to develop independent systems with unrestricted access to information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compudata.com/cloud-bi/ "Cloud BI: 5 Benefits of Cloud Business Intelligence"], ''compudata.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 onwards, the positive effects of cloud-stored information and data management transformed itself to a completely mobile-affectioned one, mostly to the benefit of decentralized and remote teams looking to tweak data or gain full visibility over it out of office. As a response to the large success of fully optimized uni-browser versions, vendors have recently begun releasing mobile-specific product applications for both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Mobile-business-intelligence-brings-benefits-and-barriers "Mobile business intelligence brings benefits -- and barriers"], ''searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud-hosted data analytics made it possible for companies to categorize and process large volumes of data, which is how we can currently speak of unlimited visualization, and intelligent decision making.

== Types ==
The key general categories of business intelligence applications are:
* [[Spreadsheets]]
* [[List of reporting software|Reporting and querying software]]: applications that extract, sort, summarize, and present selected data
* [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP)
* [[Dashboard (management information system)|Digital dashboards]]
* [[Data mining]]
* [[Business activity monitoring]]
* [[Data warehouse]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180726071809/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-warehouses-and-data-quality Exploring Data Warehouses and Data Quality] Published by Spotless Data Retrieved 15 May, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Local information systems]]
* [[Data cleansing]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171018181046/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-analysis Exploring Data Analysis] Published by Spotless Data Retrieved 15 May, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for spreadsheets, these tools are provided as standalone applications, suites of applications, components of [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems, [[application programming interface]]s or as components of software targeted to a specific industry. The tools are sometimes packaged into [[data warehouse appliance]]s.

{{distinguish|proprietary software|commercial software}}

'''Business software''' or a business application is any [[software]] or set of computer programs used by business users to perform various business functions. These business applications are used to increase productivity, to measure productivity and to perform other business functions accurately.

By and large, business software is likely to be developed to meet the needs of a specific business, and therefore is not easily transferable to a different business  environment, unless its nature and operation is identical. Due to the unique requirements of each business, off-the-shelf software is unlikely to completely address a company's needs. However, where an on-the-shelf solution is necessary, due to time or monetary considerations, some level of customization is likely to be required. Exceptions do exist, depending on the business in question, and thorough research is always required before committing to bespoke or off-the-shelf solutions.

Some business applications are interactive, i.e., they have a [[graphical user interface]] or user interface and users can query/modify/input data and view results instantaneously. They can also run reports instantaneously. Some business applications run in batch mode: they are set up to run based on a predetermined event/time and a business user does not need to initiate them or monitor them.

Some business applications are built in-house and some are bought from vendors (off the shelf software products). These business applications are installed on either desktops or big servers. Prior to the introduction of COBOL (a universal compiler) in 1965, businesses developed their own unique machine language.  RCA's language consisted of a 12-position instruction. For example, to read a record into memory, the first two digits would be the instruction (action) code. The next four positions of the instruction (an 'A' address) would be the exact leftmost memory location where you want the readable character to be placed. Four positions (a 'B' address) of the instruction would note the very rightmost memory location where you want the last character of the record to be located. A two digit 'B' address also allows a modification of any instruction. Instruction codes and memory designations excluded the use of 8's or 9's. The first RCA business application was implemented in 1962 on a 4k RCA 301.  The RCA 301, mid frame 501, and large frame 601 began their marketing in early 1960.             

Many kinds of users are found within the business environment, and can be categorized by using a small, medium and large matrix:

* The small business market generally consists of home [[accounting software]], and [[office suite]]s such as [[OpenOffice.org]] or [[Microsoft Office]].
* The medium size, or [[small and medium-sized enterprise]] (SME), has a broader range of software applications, ranging from accounting, [[groupware]], [[customer relationship management]], [[human resource management systems]], [[outsourcing relationship management]], loan origination software, [[shopping cart software]], field service software, and other productivity enhancing applications.
* The last segment covers enterprise level software applications, such as those in the fields of [[enterprise resource planning]], [[enterprise content management]] (ECM), [[business process management]] (BPM) and [[product lifecycle management]]. These applications are extensive in scope, and often come with modules that either add native functions, or incorporate the functionality of third-party computer programs.

Technologies that previously only existed in [[peer-to-peer]] software applications, like [[Kazaa]] and [[Napster]], are starting to appear within business applications.

== Types of business tools ==
* [[Enterprise application software]] (EAS)
* [[Resource Management]]
* [[Dashboard (business)|Digital dashboards]], also known as [[business intelligence]] dashboards, enterprise dashboards, or executive dashboards.  These are visually based summaries of business data that show at-a-glance understanding of conditions through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). Dashboards are a very popular  tools that have arisen in the last few years.{{when|date=April 2012}}
* Online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]),  (which include [[HOLAP]], [[ROLAP]] and [[MOLAP]]) - are a capability of some management, decision support, and executive information systems that support interactive examination of large amounts of data from many perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;James O'Brien and George Marakas, Management Information Systems, 7th ed. McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history ==
{{Tone|section|date=February 2008}}
The essential motivation for business software is to increase profits by cutting costs or speeding the [[productive cycle]]. In the earliest days of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] business [[automation]], large [[mainframe computer]]s were used to tackle the most tedious jobs, like bank cheque clearing and factory accounting.

Factory accounting software was among the most popular of early business software tools, and included the automation of [[general ledger]]s, fixed assets inventory ledgers, cost accounting ledgers, accounts receivable ledgers, and accounts payable ledgers (including payroll, life insurance, health insurance, federal and state insurance and retirement).

The early use of software to replace manual white-collar labor was extremely profitable, and caused a radical shift in white-collar labor. One computer might easily replace 100 white-collar 'pencil pushers', and the computer would not require any health or retirement benefits.

Building on these early successes with IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other early suppliers of business software solutions, corporate consumers demanded business software to replace the old-fashioned drafting board. CAD-CAM software (or [[computer-aided drafting]] for [[computer-aided manufacturing]]) arrived in the early 1980s. Also, [[project management software]] was so valued in the early 1980s that it might cost as much as $500,000 per copy (although such software typically had far fewer capabilities than modern project management software such as [[Microsoft Project]], which one might purchase today for under $500 per copy.)

In the early days, perhaps the most noticeable, widespread change in business software was the word processor. Because of its rapid rise, the ubiquitous IBM typewriter suddenly vanished in the 1980s as millions of companies worldwide shifted to the use of [[Word Perfect]] business software, and later, [[Microsoft Word]] software. Another vastly popular computer program for business were mathematical spreadsheet programs such as [[Lotus 1-2-3]], and later [[Microsoft Excel]].

In the 1990s business shifted massively towards [[globalism]] with the appearance of [[SAP AG|SAP]] software which coordinates a supply-chain of vendors, potentially worldwide, for the most efficient, streamlined operation of factory manufacture.

Yet nothing in the history of business software has had the global impact of the [[Internet]], with its [[email]] and websites that now serve commercial interests worldwide. Globalism in business fully arrived when the Internet became a household word.

The next phase in the evolution of business software is being led by the emergance of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which involves identifying and automating highly repetitive tasks and processes, with an aim to drive operational efficiency, reduce costs and limit [[human error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stokes|first1=Jonathan|title=A Two-Pronged Approach to Overcome Challenges in the Insurance Industry|url=https://medium.com/@stokesjonathan38/a-two-pronged-approach-to-overcome-challenges-in-the-insurance-industry-b26146f9cb70|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industries that have been in the forefront of RPA adoption include the Insurance industry, Banking and Financial Services, the Legal industry and the Healthcare industry.

== Application support ==
Business applications are built based on the requirements from the business users. Also, these business applications are built to use certain kind of Business transactions or data items. These business applications run flawlessly until there are no new business requirements or there is no change in underlying Business transactions. Also, the business applications run flawlessly if there are no issues with computer hardware, computer networks (Intenet/intranet), computer disks, power supplies, and various software components (middleware, database, computer programs, etc.).

Business applications can fail when an unexpected error occurs. This error could occur due to a data error (an unexpected data input or a wrong data input), an environment error (an in frastructure related error), a programming error, a human error or a work flow error. When a business application fails one needs to fix the business application error as soon as possible so that the business users can resume their work. This work of resolving business application errors is known as business application support.

=== Reporting errors ===
The Business User calls the business application support team phone number or sends an e-mail to the business application support team. The business application support team gets all the details of the error from the business user on the phone or from the e-mail. These details are then entered in a tracking software. The tracking software creates a request number and this request number is given to the business user. This request number is used to track the progress on the support issue. The request is assigned to a support team member.

=== Notification of errors ===
For critical business application errors (such as an application not available or an application not working correctly), an e-mail is sent to the entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with an estimated time for application availability.

=== Investigation or analysis of application errors ===
The business application support team member collects all the necessary information about the business software error. This information is then recorded in the support request. All of the data used by the business user is also used in the investigation. The application program is reviewed for any possible programming errors.

=== Error resolution  ===
If any similar business application errors occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and the error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new support error, then new issue resolution steps are created and the error is resolved. The new support error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for future use. For major business application errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error.

=== Code correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to programming errors, then a request is created for the application development team to correct programming errors. If the business user needs new features or functions in the business application, then the required analysis/design/programming/testing/release is planned and a new version of the business software is deployed.

=== Business process correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to a work flow issue or human errors during data input, then the business users are notified. Business users then review their work flow and revise it if necessary. They also modify the user guide or user instructions to avoid such an error in the future.

=== Infrastructure issue correction ===
If the business application error occurred due to infrastructure issues, then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fixes for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid the re-occurrence of the same error.

== Support follow up and internal reporting ==
The business application error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor the resolved issues, repeating issues, and pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of business applications.

In [[management]], '''business transformation''' involves making fundamental changes in how [[commerce | business]] is conducted in order to help cope with shifts in [[market environment]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://hbr.org/2007/01/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail/ar/1 Harvard Business Review] January 2007 Kotter
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Business Transformation is the process of fundamentally changing the systems, processes, people and technology across a whole business or business unit, to achieve measurable improvements in efficiency, effectiveness and stakeholder satisfaction. As such, a business transformation project is likely to include any number of change management projects, each focused on an individual process, system, technology, team or department."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.changeassociates.com/blog/post/what-is-business-transformation|title=Business Transformation|last=Cruise|first=David|date=14 Sep 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==When business transformation is used==
The need for business transformation may be caused by external changes in the market such as an organisation's products or services being out of date, funding or income streams being changed, new regulations coming into force or market competition becoming more intense. This management approach also incorporates [[Business Process Reengineering]] and is widely used:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/What_successful_transformations_share_McKinsey_Global_Survey_results_2550 McKinsey Survey] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* to increase [[revenue]] or [[market share]]
* to improve [[customer satisfaction]]
* to [[cost-cutting|cut costs]]

==Components==
Business transformation is achieved by one or more of: realigning the way staff work, how the organisation is structured, the core product or service portfolio of the business and how technology is used. Typically organisations go through several stages in transforming themselves:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/2007/01/leading-change-why-transformation-efforts-fail/ar/1 Harvard Business Review] January 2007 Kotter&lt;/ref&gt;
* recognising the need to change and gaining consensus amongst stakeholders that change is necessary
* agreeing what form the change should take, the objectives of the change and a [[vision (business)|vision]] that describes a better future
* understanding what the organization is changing from and what needs to change in detail 
* designing the new organisational way of working and its support and management
* testing and implementing changes, usually in waves, typically over a number of years
* bedding in the change so that the organisation cannot move back to how it was and achieves the intended benefits. 
Business transformation can lead to developing new competencies and making better use of existing competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Bak, O. (2016). Investigating Organizational Transformation in Automotive Supply Chains: A Case Study on B2B and Extranet. Strategic Change, 25(3), 299-314. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformation examples==
Examples of organisational transformation include:
* [[General Motors]]' transformation and restructuring&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4ac676c4-f406-11df-886b-00144feab49a.html#axzz2GrGLsh8r Transformed GM back in the game] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BBC]]'s Delivering Quality First programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/howwework/reports/deliveringqualityfirst.html BBC website] October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Box_(company)|Box]]'s pivot from consumer to enterprise &lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/13/box-the-path-from-arringtons-backyard-to-a-billion-dollar-business/ Box: The Path From Arrington’s Backyard To A Billion Dollar Business] "Josh Stein started to connect the dots on doing an SaaS enterprise model. We credit him to being able to shine light for us on something we couldn’t see.” 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="950">{{Unreferenced|date=November 2008}}'''Captive supply''' is a term for that part of the supply that is not owned by a [[company]] but is used by the company to maximize its own [[Profit (economics)|profits]] often at the unknowing expense of those who actually own those supplies. This is usually a characteristic of a market that is dominated by one firm or a few firms and implicit collusion between those firms.  Often captive supply is called a beneficial market agreement by those controlling the supply but the actions of those controlling that supply reveal otherwise.  Captive supply is used to subvert the natural forces of market price determination to accrue more economic benefits to those who control it.  It circumvents the typically price-moderating [[market force]] of [[supply and demand]] by artificially restricting the supply. Example: American Bar Association Over Legal Industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">A '''channel partner''' is a company that partners with a manufacturer or producer to market and sell the manufacturer's products, services, or technologies. This is usually done through a [[co-branding]] relationship. Channel partners may be distributors, vendors, retailers, consultants, systems integrators (SI), technology deployment consultancies, and [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs) and other such organizations.

== Managed services channel partner ==
The [[Managed services|Managed Services]] Channel Program (MSCP) defines managed services based on market and industry [[best practice]]s, validates a provider’s managed service against those standards, and offers escalating rewards tied to the value delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Channel partner programs|url=https://www.channelinstitute.com/successful-channel-partner-programs |accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outsourcing channel partner ==
The Outsourcing Channel Program is designed for partners who are taking over management of customer assets for multiple years across multiple technologies, either at the customer site or at another location like a remote [[data center]].

== Referral partner ==
The referral partner is any individual, usually a professional consultant, existing customer, or sales professional, who can refer new customers to the manufacturer in any number of ways.  Increasingly, companies are taking advantage of this type of partner as more and more individuals find work independently consulting and referring manufacturer solutions to their clients—which in essence provides a low cost way for manufacturers to manage their sales efforts.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Partner relationship management (PRM) software ==
With the increased reliance on the channel to drive sales efforts, technology has emerged to help support these efforts. [[Partner relationship management]] (PRM) is the term most widely used to refer to this type of technology.

The term '''citizen enterprise''' started to be used in the United States in 2008 to describe businesses that practice [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR).

==Information==
In some countries, such as Papua New Guinea, the term is used to describe companies owned by citizens of that country, rather than by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipa.gov.pg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=128 The Papua New Guinea Investment Promotion Agency - Citizen, National and Foreign Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be confused with [[social enterprise]], which is a more complex notion involving origin, ownership and participation as well as objectives, activities and the use of profits.

A '''pre-entry closed shop''' (or simply '''closed shop''') is a form of [[union security agreement]] under which the employer agrees to hire [[trade union|union]] members only, and employees must remain members of the union at all times in order to remain employed. This is different from a post-entry closed shop (US: [[union shop]]), which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/SWEDEN/ANCHOR-ORGANISATIONSKLAUSUL-SE.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130815224141/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/SWEDEN/ANCHOR-ORGANISATIONSKLAUSUL-SE.htm |archivedate=2013-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a union shop, the union must accept as a member any person hired by the employer.&lt;ref name="Pynes"&gt;Pynes, Joan. ''Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations.'' 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7879-7078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Labour Organization]] covenants do not address the legality of closed shop provisions, leaving the question up to each individual nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+%40ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 "Case(s) No(s). 188, Report No. 34 (Denmark): Complaints against the Government of Denmark presented by Swiss Printing Workers' Union and the Swiss Federation of National Christian Trade Unions."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190504/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/pdconv.pl?host=status01&amp;textbase=iloeng&amp;document=1905&amp;chapter=3&amp;query=(Denmark)+@ref&amp;highlight=&amp;querytype=bool&amp;context=0 |date=2011-06-04 }} Document No. 031960034188.

March 4, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of closed shop agreements varies widely from country to country, ranging from bans on the agreement, to extensive regulation of the agreement to not mentioning it at all.

==Legal status==
===United States===
The [[Taft–Hartley Act]] outlawed the closed shop in the [[United States]] in 1947. The [[union shop]] was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Pattern Makers v. NLRB"&gt;{{Cite web  |title = Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95, 126 (1985)|url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=473&amp;invol=95|publisher = U.S. Supreme Court|date = June 27, 1985|accessdate = 5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; States that have passed [[right-to-work law]]s go further by not allowing employers to require employees to pay a form of union dues called an agency fee. An employer may not lawfully agree with a union to hire only union members, but it may agree to require employees to join the union or pay the equivalent of union dues to it, within a set period after starting employment. Similarly, while a union could require an employer that had agreed to a closed shop contract prior to 1947 to fire an employee who had been expelled from the union for any reason, it cannot demand that an employer fire an employee under a union shop contract for any reason other than failure to pay those dues that are uniformly required of all employees.

The United States Government does not permit the union shop in any federal agency regardless of state law allowing for such.

Construction unions and unions in other industries with similar employment patterns have coped with the prohibition of closed shops by using exclusive [[hiring hall]]s as a means of controlling the supply of labor. While such exclusive hiring halls do not, in a strictly formal sense, require union membership as a condition of employment, they do so in practical terms, in that an employee seeking to be dispatched to work through the union's hiring hall must either pay union dues or pay a roughly equivalent hiring hall fee. So long as the hiring hall is run on a non-discriminatory basis and adheres to clearly stated eligibility and dispatch standards, it is lawful. The Taft–Hartley Act also bars unions from requiring unreasonably high initiation fees as a condition of membership in order to prevent unions from using initiation fees as a device to keep non-union employees out of a particular industry. Also, the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter into pre-hire agreements, in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union. The NLRA prohibits pre-hire agreements outside the construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;29 USCA 158&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[entertainment industry]], unions representing performers have as their first rule one banning any represented performer from working on any non-union production. Penalties are imposed on the union member, not on the employer, and can lead to loss of union membership. Most major productions are union productions, and non-members join the [[Screen Actors Guild]] through performing as [[extra (actor)|extras]] and earning three union vouchers, or by being given a speaking line and entering that way. The other performance unions do not have minimum membership standards, but joining the union bars one from working on non-union productions.

All four major sports leagues are union shops,{{fact|date=March 2015}} even though a franchise may be located in a state that has a right-to-work law or constitutional provision.

===Canada===
The status of closed shops varies from province to province within Canada. The [[Canadian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has ruled that, while [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section Two]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guaranteed both the freedom to associate ''and'' the freedom not to associate, employees in a work-environment largely dominated by a union were beneficiaries of union policies, and as such should pay union fees, regardless of membership status. However, religious and conscientious objectors were allowed the option of paying the amount to a [[registered charity]] instead.

===United Kingdom===
Dunn and Gennard found 111 United Kingdom cases of dismissals on the introduction of a closed shop, involving 325 individuals.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dunn, Stephen |author2=Gennard, John |title=The Closed Shop on British Industry|publisher=Macmillan |location=London and Basingstoke |year=1984 |isbn=0-333-26203-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}} They state "While proponents of the closed shop may argue that an estimated minimum 325 dismissals is a relatively small number compared with the total population covered by closed shops, critics would see the figure as substantial arguing that one dismissal is one too many."&lt;ref name=Dunn/&gt;{{rp|126}} In relation to the pre-entry closed shop, they state "Its ''raison d'être'' is to exclude people from jobs by denying them union membership".&lt;ref name=Dunn/&gt;{{rp|132}} 
 
All forms of closed shops in the UK are illegal following the introduction of the [[Employment Act 1990]].  They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]] (c. 52)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1992/ukpga_19920052_en_9#pt3-pb1-l1g137&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government at the time. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], then in opposition, had supported closed shops until December 1989, when it abandoned the policy in accordance with European legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/18/newsid_2538000/2538439.stm | work=BBC News | title=1989: Labour's union U-turn | date=18 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Labour shadow arts minister [[Thangam Debbonaire]] announced to an [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] conference in May 2016 that she favoured the introduction of a "limited" closed shop for actors, as part of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s pledge to strengthen and introduce a new package of employment rights beneficial to employees.&lt;ref name=MS&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landin|first1=Conrad|title=Equity: Closed shop 'way forward for arts'|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-bf65-Equity-Closed-shop-way-forward-for-arts|accessdate=28 May 2016|work=Morning Star|date=24 May 2016|location=Bristol|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity was one of the last trade unions in the United Kingdom to offer a pre-entry closed shop until the 1990 act.&lt;ref name=MS /&gt;

===Australia===
All forms of closed shops in the Commonwealth are illegal under Workplace Relations Act 1996.  There was an attempt by the Howard Government to change the definition of what constituted a closed shop under the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, More Pay) Bill 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Destroyer|first=Cask|title=Division 5A- Closed Shops|url=http://corrigan.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/bill/wrlajbpb1999614/|publisher=Austlii|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the bill was subsequently defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bills of Previous Parliaments|work=Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;orderBy=priority,title;page=15;query=Dataset%3AbillsPrevParl%20Dataset_Phrase%3A%22billhome%22%20Decade%3A%221990s%22%20Year%3A%221999%22;rec=3;resCount=Default|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[loan agreement|lending agreements]], '''collateral''' is a [[Borrower|borrower's]] [[pledge (law)|pledge]] of specific [[property]] to a [[lender]], to [[Secured loan|secure]] repayment of a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garrett | first = Joan F. | authorlink = | title = Banks and Their Customers | publisher = Oceana Publications | location = Dobbs Ferry, NY | year = 1995 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-379-11194-2 | page = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 | page = 513 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collateral serves as a lender's protection against a borrower's [[default (finance)|default]] and so can be used to offset the loan if the borrower fails to pay the [[principal sum|principal]] and [[interest]] satisfactorily under the terms of the lending agreement.

The protection that collateral provides generally allows lenders to offer a lower [[interest rate]] on loans that have collateral compared to those without collateral because the [[credit risk|risk]] of loss to the lender is lower. The reduction in interest rate can be up to several percentage points, depending on the type and value of the collateral. For example, the interest rate (APR) on an unsecured loan is often much higher than on a [[secured loan]] or [[logbook loan]], as the risk for the lender is then increased.

If a borrower defaults on a loan (due to [[insolvency]] or another event), that borrower loses the property pledged as collateral, with the lender then becoming the owner of the property. In a typical [[mortgage loan]] transaction, for instance, the [[real estate]] being acquired with the help of the loan serves as collateral. If the buyer fails to repay the loan according to the mortgage agreement, the lender can use the [[legal process]] of [[foreclosure]] to obtain ownership of the real estate. A [[pawnbroker]] is a common example of a business that may accept a wide range of items as collateral.

The type of the collateral may be restricted based on the type of the loan (as is the case with auto loans and mortgages); it also can be flexible, such as in the case of collateral-based personal loans.

==Concept==
Collateral, especially within [[banking]], traditionally refers to [[Secured loan|secured lending]] (also known as [[asset-based lending]]). More-complex collateralization arrangements may be used to secure [[trade]] transactions (also known as ''capital market collateralization''). The former often presents unilateral obligations secured in the form of [[property]], [[surety]], [[guarantee]] or other collateral (originally denoted by the term ''security''), whereas the latter often presents bilateral obligations secured by more-liquid assets such as [[cash]] or [[security (finance)|securities]], often known as [[margin (finance)|margin]].

==Marketable collateral==
Marketable collateral is the exchange of [[financial assets]], such as stocks and bonds, for a loan between a financial institution and borrower. To be deemed marketable, assets must be capable of being sold under normal market conditions with reasonable promptness at current [[fair market value]]. For [[national banks]] to accept a borrower's loan proposal, collateral must be equal to or greater than 100% of the loan or credit extension amount. In the United States of America, the bank's total outstanding loans and credit extensions to one borrower may not exceed 15 percent of the bank's capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/32.3|title=12 CFR 32.3 - Lending limits.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction of collateral value is the primary risk when securing loans with marketable collateral. Financial institutions closely monitor the [[market value]] of any financial assets held as collateral and take appropriate action if the value subsequently declines below the predetermined maximum loan-to-value ratio. The permitted actions are generally specified in a loan agreement or margin agreement.

'''Commercial law''', also known as '''trade law''', is the body of [[law]] that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of [[Legal person|persons]] and businesses engaged in [[commerce]], [[merchandising]], [[trade]], and sales.&lt;ref name=cornellcommerciallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Law: An Overview|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_law|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often considered to be a branch of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and deals with issues of both [[private law]] and [[public law]].

Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; [[Maritime transport|merchant shipping]]; [[guarantee]]; marine, fire, life, and accident [[insurance]]; bills of exchange, [[Negotiable instrument|negotiable instruments]], [[Contract|contracts]] and partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Commercial Law|volume=6|page=771|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these categories fall within [[Financial law]], an aspected of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate [[corporation|corporate]] [[contract]]s, [[Recruitment|hiring practices]], and the [[manufacturing|manufacture]] and [[sales]] of [[Final good|consumer goods]]. Many countries have adopted [[civil code]]s that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.

In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the [[United States Congress]], under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adoption]] of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the U.S. territories.

Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly ''vis-a-vis'' employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.

'''Consumer privacy''' is a form of [[information privacy]] concerned with the [[legal]] and [[political]] issues arising from the interaction of the public's [[expectation of privacy]] with the collection and dissemination of [[data]] by [[Business|businesses]] or [[Merchant|merchants]]. [[Consumer]] privacy concerns date back to the first commercial [[courier]]s and bankers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy. In modern times, the [[ethical code]]s of most professions specify measures to protect customer privacy, including [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]], and [[national security]]. Since most organizations have a competitive incentive to retain exclusive access to customer data, and since customer trust is usually a priority, many companies adopt [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy.

'''Consumer privacy protection''' is the use of laws and regulations to protect individuals from privacy loss due to the failures and limitations of corporate customer privacy measures.  Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid [[legal liability]] in the chance that lapses of security may occur. Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a [[telephone company]] had access to unprecedented levels of information. Customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate [[data sharing]], [[Mergers and acquisitions|corporate mergers]], [[employee turnover]], and theft of data storage devices (e.g., [[hard drives]]) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
Consumer privacy concerns date back{{When|date=June 2017}} to the first commercial [[courier]]s and [[bank]]ers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy.{{Where|date=June 2017}} Harsh punitive measures were passed as the result of failing to keep a customer's information private. In modern times, the [[ethical code]]s of most professions specify privacy measures for the consumer of any service, including [[medical privacy]], [[client confidentiality]], and [[national security]]. These codes are particularly important in a [[carceral state]], where no privacy in any form nor limits on [[State (polity)|state]] oversight or data use exists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Modern concerns ===
'''Corporate customer privacy practices''' are approaches taken by commercial organizations to ensure that confidential customer data is not stolen or abused.  Since most organizations have strong competitive incentives to retain exclusive access to these data, and since customer trust is usually a high priority, most companies take some [[security engineering]] measures to protect customer privacy. There is also a concern that companies may sell consumer data if they have to declare bankruptcy, although it often violates their own privacy policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siam|first=Kayla|date=2017|title=Coming to a Retailer near You: Consumer Privacy Protection in Retail Bankruptcies|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=1014a1d6-916f-4c56-8b6e-a7bc3d603ba2%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=124102448|journal=Emory Bankruptcy Developments Journal|volume=33|pages=487-521|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vary in effectiveness, and would not typically meet the much higher standards of [[client confidentiality]] applied by [[ethical code]]s or [[legal code]]s in [[banking]] or [[law]], nor [[patient privacy]] measures in medicine, nor rigorous [[national security]] measures in military and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence organizations]].

Since they operate for-profit, commercial organizations also cannot spend unlimited funds on precautions while remaining competitive; a commercial context tends to limit privacy measures and to motivate organizations to share data when working in partnership. The damage done by privacy loss is not measurable, nor can it be undone, and commercial organizations have little or no interest in taking unprofitable measures to drastically increase the privacy of customers. Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid legal liability in the chance that lapses of security may occur. This has led to many [[moral hazard]]s and customer privacy violation incidents.

Some services—notably [[telecommunications]], including [[Internet]]—require collecting a vast array of information about users’ activities in the course of business, and may also require consultation of these data to prepare [[Invoice|bills]]. In the US and Canada, telecom data must be kept for seven years to permit dispute and consultation about phone charges. These sensitivities have led telecom regulation to be a leader in consumer privacy regulation, enforcing a high level of confidentiality on the sensitive customer communication records.

Focusing on telecom has been outmoded to some degree as other industries also gather sensitive data. Such common commercial measures as software-based [[customer relationship management]], rewards programs, and [[target market]]ing tend to drastically increase the amount of information gathered (and sometimes shared).  These very drastically increase privacy risks and have accelerated the shift to regulation, rather than relying on the corporate desire to preserve goodwill.

== Legal protection ==
 {{chronological|date=June 2017}}

Concerns have led to consumer privacy laws in most countries, especially in the [[European Union]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. Notably, among developed countries, the [[United States]] has no such law and relies on corporate customer privacy disclosed in privacy policies to ensure consumer privacy in general. Modern privacy law and regulation may be compared to parts of the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which includes a requirement for doctors to avoid mentioning the ills of patients to others—not only to protect them, but to protect their families— and also recognizes that innocent third parties can be harmed by the loss of control of sensitive personal information.

Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a [[telephone company]]—especially a [[monopoly]] (known in many nations as a [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|PTT]])—had access to unprecedented levels of information: the direct customer's communication habits and correspondents and the data of those who shared the household. Telephone operators could frequently hear conversations—inadvertently or deliberately—and their job required them to dial the exact numbers. The data gathering required for the process of billing began to become a privacy risk as well.  Accordingly, strong rules on operator behaviour, customer confidentiality, records keeping and destruction were enforced on telephone companies in every country. Typically only police and military authorities had legal powers to [[wiretap]] or see records.  Even stricter requirements emerged for various banks' electronic records In some countries, [[financial privacy]] is a major focus of the economy, with severe criminal penalties for violating it.

==1970s==
Through the 1970s many other organizations in [[developed nation]]s began to acquire sensitive data, but there were few or no regulations in place to prevent them from sharing or abusing the data.  Customer trust and goodwill were generally thought to be sufficient in first-world countries, notably the [[United States]], to ensure the protection of truly sensitive data;  ''[[caveat emptor]]'' was applied in these situations.  But in the 1980s, smaller organizations also began to get access to computer hardware and software, and these simply did not have the procedures or personnel or expertise, nor less the time, to take rigorous measures to protect their customers.  Meanwhile, via [[target marketing]] and [[rewards programs]], companies were acquiring ever more data.

Gradually, customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate data sharing, corporate mergers, employee turnover, and theft of data storage devices (e.g., [[hard drives]]) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location. Explicit regulation of consumer privacy gained further support, especially in the [[European Union]], where each nation had laws that were incompatible (e.g., some restricted the [[Data collection|collection]], some the [[Data compilation|compilation]], and some the [[Data dissemination|dissemination of data]]); it was possible to violate privacy within the EU simply doing these things from different places in the [[European Common Market]] as it existed before 1992.

==1990s==
Through the 1990s, the proliferation of [[mobile telecom]], the introduction of [[customer relationship management]], and the use of the [[Internet]] in [[developed nation]]s brought the situation to the forefront, and most countries had to implement strong consumer privacy laws, often over the objections of business. The [[European Union]] and [[New Zealand]] passed particularly strong laws that were used as a template for more limited laws in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] and some states of the [[United States]] (where no federal law for consumer privacy exists, although there are requirements specific to banking and telecom privacy). In [[Austria]] around the 1990s, the mere mention of a client's name in a semi-public social setting was enough to earn a junior bank executive a stiff jail sentence.

==2001==
After the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|terrorist attacks]] against the [[United States]] on [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|September 11, 2001,]] privacy took a back-seat to [[national security]] in legislators' minds.  Accordingly, concerns of consumer privacy in the [[United States]] have tended to go unheard of as questions of citizen privacy versus the state, and the development of a [[police state]] or [[carceral state]], have occupied advocates of strong privacy measures. Whereas it may have appeared prior to 2002 that commercial organizations and the consumer data they gathered were of primary concern, it has appeared since then in most [[developed nation]]s to be much less of a concern than [[political privacy]] and [[medical privacy]] (e.g., as violated by [[biometrics]]).  Indeed, people have recently been [[No Fly List|stopped at airports]] solely due to their political views, and there appears{{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}} to be minimal public will to stop practices of this nature.

'''Corporate development''' refers to the planning and execution of strategies to meet organizational objectives. The kinds of activities falling under corporate development may include management team recruitment, phasing in or out of markets or products, arranging strategic alliances, identifying and acquiring companies ([[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]]), securing [[Corporate finance|corporate financing]], [[Divestment|divesting of assets or divisions]], and management of intellectual property. The activities encompassed are often the role of the [[CEO]]. 

==Process==

Corporate strategy depends on the circumstances of a company and the area where development is desired. Corporate development is usually a process that takes place over an extended period of time and may be adjusted or refined as the project moves forward

==Reshaping management==

One of the manifestations of corporate development has to do with reshaping the management arm of the corporation. This may involve a process of phasing certain management positions out of the existing structure or creating new positions in an effort to strengthen the management team. As part of this type of approach, corporate development may also demand that one or more current managers are released from the company and replaced with people who possess skills required to move the company forward. When this is the case, the corporate development team will handle the functions of recruitment and evaluation of potential hires.

==Growing the company==

The process of corporate development can also be applied to the task of growing the company through mergers and acquisitions. In this scenario, the project development will involve identifying potential target companies for acquisitions or unions resulting in a new and more aggressive corporation. The team will consider all possible outcomes from any given potential merger or acquisition and attempt to project if the action is likely to result in positive growth or could possibly impair the company permanently.

Just as a management team may be revamped, corporate development may also be employed to change the current focus for clients. This may mean looking into the potential for breaking into new markets with existing products or developing complementary products that will allow this type of expansion. Corporate development strategy would monitor the trends associated with a corporation's products or services and helps the corporation establish strategies to find more customers. In addition, corporate development works to maximize the profits of a corporation by figuring out the appropriate pricing for a given good or service. A corporate development team also leads discussions with sales department heads regarding how to market corporate goods, organize marketing campaigns, analyze market research and incorporate any customer advice or complaints into marketing strategies in such cases; extensive industry specific business experience is often preferred which is why companies may hire an external firm to help them engage in such moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Corporate_Development_Manager_Career_Profile.html |title=Corporate Development Manager Careers: Salary &amp; Job Description |publisher=Diplomaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the status of the base market, corporate development may also look at shifting away from a shrinking consumer market while seeking market share in a different consumer market with newer products. For example, many typewriter manufacturers during the 1980s and 1990s slowly phased out their core business and began to focus more on computer parts and accessories as a way to continue operations.

==Need for specialists==
Particularly in larger companies, corporate development is provided as a charter for a particular executive or team. In these cases, the opportunities and initiatives are numerous enough to justify specialists, instead of being delegated to the office of the CEO and line of business executives. When focused on product or financial issues, corporate development executives often have [[MBA]], [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] or [[Certified Practising Accountant|CPA]] credentials. Often the internal corporate development executives come from a legal or investment banking background, due to the complex contractual and valuation issues associated with many transactions.

'''Customer attrition''', also known as '''customer churn''', '''customer turnover''', or '''customer defection''', is the loss of clients or customers.

[[Bank]]s, telephone service companies, [[Internet service provider]]s, [[pay TV]] companies, [[insurance]] firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] (along with [[cash flow]], [[EBITDA]], etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1990/09/zero-defections-quality-comes-to-services/ar/1 ''Zero Defections: Quality comes to service.''], Reichheld &amp; Sasser. Harvard Business review. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies from these sectors often have [[customer service]] branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.

Companies usually make a distinction between '''voluntary churn''' and '''involuntary churn'''. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

When companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the distinction between '''gross attrition''' and '''net attrition'''. Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated [[recurring revenue]] for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called '''Recurring Monthly Revenue''' (or '''RMR''').   In the 2000s, there are also a number of [[business intelligence]] software programs which can [[data mining|mine databases]] of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated [[predictive analytics]] software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing [[customer retention]] marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

==Retail services applications==
[[Financial services]] such as banking and insurance use applications of [[predictive analytics]] for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' [[business model]]s. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including [[retail]]ing, [[telecommunications]] and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their ''good'' customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of '''partial customer churn'''.

Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have [[churn rate]]s ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.

Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, [[online banking]] and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.

Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown{{By whom|date=October 2017}} to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.

==Research==
Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies, and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) approaches can impact churn rates. Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model. This model can take [[Demography|demographic characteristics]], environmental changes, and other factors into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Customer Attrition Analysis For Financial Services Using Proportional Hazard Models | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.8919 | author1 = Van Den Poel | author2 = Lariviére | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00069-9 | volume=157 | pages=196–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention. Using data mining and software, one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models. One researcher notes that "...retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs, the higher volume of service consumption, and customer referrals." The argument is that to build an "...effective customer retention program," managers have to come to an understanding of "...why customers leave" and "...identify the customers with high risk of leaving" by accurately predicting customer attrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCIM/bin/get.cgi?directory=vol6_1/&amp;filename=li.html ''Applying and evaluating models to predict customer attrition using data mining techniques''], Tom Au, et al. Journal of Comparative International Management. 1 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
In the [[business]] context, "churn" refers both to customers' migration and to their loss of value. So, "churn rate" refers, on the one hand, to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization, or, on the other hand, to the customers who still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to.
Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge: to be able to anticipate to customers’ abandon in order to retain them on time, reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity.
There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations, and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data. They aim to put at the service of [[marketing]] departments and agencies –and of all business users- the necessary weapons to:
* Detect soon which customers are about to abandon and to know them in depth, answering to questions such as: Who are they? or How do they behave?
* Know the real value of the potential loss of those customers, with the aim of establishing priorities and distributing business efforts and resources efficiently, optimizing resources and maximizing the value of the current customers’ portfolio.
* Put into practice personalized retention plans in order to reduce or avoid their migration, increasing the capability to react and anticipating to possible non-predicted fugues.

==Reduction==
There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in [[customer service]] in order to reduce customer attrition. [[The International Customer Service Institute]] has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme.

==Management==
Not all customer attrition is bad. For many firms, it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers.&lt;ref&gt;Ka‐shing Woo, Henry K.Y. Fock, (2004) Retaining and divesting customers: an exploratory study of right customers, “at‐risk” right customers, and wrong customers. ''Journal of Services Marketing, 18'', 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6147">'''Desktop outsourcing''' is the process in which an [[organization]] contracts a third party to maintain and manage parts of its [[IT infrastructure]]. Contracts vary in depth and can range from [[Computer maintenance|Computer hard]]- and [[software maintenance]] to [[Desktop virtualisation]], [[SaaS]]-implementations and [[Helpdesk]] operation.  It is estimated, that 32% of U.S. and Canadian IT organisations make use of desktop outsourcing in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekker|first1=Scott|title=Should You Outsource Your Help Desk?|url=http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2014/09/01/Should-You-Outsource.aspx?Page=3|website=Redmond Magazine|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market reports suggest the adoption of [[BYOD]] policies to allow the end-user a free choice of devices in their working environment may increase this market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/xbv6lv/global_desktop|website=Research and Markets|publisher=TechNavio|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Desktop-Outsourcing im Trend|url=http://www.itadministrator.de/themen/virtualisierung/111035.html|website=ITAdministrator.de|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viability==
Justification for desktop outsourcing could include shifting focus and energy to areas of core competency, reducing staffing costs, and the routine maintenance, upgrades, and repairs associated with managing multitudes of PC systems and servers. (Applegate et al. 2007). Managers may also seek desktop outsourcing as a method of simplifying organisational structures to cut costs associated with them.&lt;ref name="dfcw"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedlander|first1=David|title=Why outsource desktop management?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Why-outsource-desktop-management|website=ComputerWeekly.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For smaller companies it might also be more viable financially to outsource their desktop at a set price per machine, rather than creating an entire internal IT department.&lt;ref name="littman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littman|first1=Dan|title=Outsourcing the desktop|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2655241/techology-business/outsourcing-the-desktop.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent market growth can also be attributed to the decreasing price of hardware, making replacement more favourable than repairs.&lt;ref name="dfcw" /&gt; Possible risks when desktop outsourcing are ensuring continued support for old a unique systems the company depends on, specifically if any of the systems in question were internally developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=Stephen|title=Managing Risk in Outsourcing: The Strategy|url=http://www.sourcingmag.com/managing-risk-in-outsourcing-the-strategy/|website=SourcingMag.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may cause the contractor to be unable to fulfil their contractual obligations, as in the case of the US Navy outsourcing their IT systems to EDS in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ephraim|title=Painful lessons from IT outsourcing gone bad|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2652801/outsourcing/painful-lessons-from-it-outsourcing-gone-bad.html|website=InfoWorld.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market situation==
A 2012 TechNavio market report forecasts that the desktop outsourcing market will grow by 4.65% yearly, between 2012 and 2016. [[Atos]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[IBM]] are considered the leading desktop outsourcing vendors for that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research and Markets: Global Desktop Outsourcing Market 2012-2016 Research Report|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/research-markets-global-desktop-outsourcing-104100265.html|website=Yahoo Finance|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gartner]] report from 2013, however, considers the desktop outsourcing market to be in decline, with growth only occurring on the Latin American and Asia/Pacific markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide IT Outsourcing Market to Reach $288 Billion in 2013|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2550615|website=gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* While consolidating School Districts in 2003, New York city brought in Dell to assess and consolidate their IT systems. At the time it was unclear how many devices actually existed in the network. Being largely successful, this netted Dell a $20 million yearly contract to keep on managing the School Districts systems.&lt;ref name="littman" /&gt;
* NASA's Kennedy Space Center had its IT services, approximately 22,000 devices, outsourced in 1998 for $30 million a year on a 3-year contract.&lt;ref name="gaogov"&gt;{{cite web|title=DESKTOP OUTSOURCING: Positive Results Reported, but Analyses Could Be Strengthened|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/240/234095.pdf|website=gao.gov|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Originally known as the Donor Assistance Database, the DAD was re-branded as the Development Assistance Database on August 2, 2005. The first Donor Assistance Database was a [[Personal Computer|PC]] system developed in the scope of the G7 Support Implementation Group project for &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnabz352.pdf|title=Business Toolkit for Russian Enterprises "Professional Associations Component"|date=1996-09-01|website=|publisher=Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu JLA Group Ltd.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Russia]] in 1996 to monitor aid assistance donated from the international community. The first Donor Assistance Database tracked 20,000 projects and over US $100 billion in Official Development Assistance delivered between 1991 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/ccsi/print/region/directry.htm|title=Directory of U.S. Technical Assistance Activities in Russia|date=1996-09-01|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DAD was then adapted as a tool for the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union to monitor development assistance from the international community. These first generation implementations include [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Tajikistan]].

Most of these implementations have taken place through a partnership between the software company Synergy International Systems, and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP). This partnership led to the signing of a Long Term Agreement in July, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sz.undp.org/content/dam/swaziland/docs/publications/UNDP_SZ_Poverty_DonorDatabaseStudy2012.pdf|title=Study to Establish a Donor database in the Kingdom of Swaziland|date=2012-09-01|website=|publisher=Government of Swaziland With Support from UNDP|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and Capabilities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

DAD Rwanda is Rwanda’s official development aid (ODA) coordination system. It is used by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MINECOFIN) to track and manage aid funds and development results across all major donors and NGOs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The system captures the national Donor Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) mutual accountability framework, indicators and standard definitions and is used for annual Rwanda ODA Effectiveness reports. In 2010 an upgrade of the DAD resulted in establishing a new MTEF module with the view of systematically capturing forward-spending plans of Development Partners to feed into the MTEF process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/derec/unitedkingdom/11_EvaluationSupportPublicFinanceManagement%20ReformRwanda.pdf|title=Rwanda: Independent Evaluation of the Implementation of the PFM Reform Strategy 2008-2012|date=2012-11-01|website=|publisher=ECORYS Nederland BV|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAD Rwanda was also integrated with Rwanda’s SmartFMIS budgeting platform that resulted in more external funds flowing directly to Ministry of Planning for spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IATI-Country-Pilots.pdf|title=IATI Delivering at National Level|last=Ronald Nkusi, MINECOFIN, Rwanda|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparent governance has improved Rwanda’s Business Environment rankings and Rwanda’s data-driven model for aid management has been emulated by Burundi, Cameroon, Mauritania and Central African Republic.

=== Iraq ===
Launched in 2011 Iraq Development Management System (IDMS) is a web-based planning, budgeting and results tracking system used by the Iraq Ministry of Planning (MoP) to manage the entire cycle of government and donor-funded projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2004/05/03/database-will-help-track-international-aid-in-iraq.aspx|title=Database will help track international aid in Iraq|last=Dawn S. Onley|date=2004-06-03|website=gcn.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IDMS covers 3000 projects with a total value of US$186 billion under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014. The system automates submission of new project proposals, annual and monthly budget preparation, advanced performance tracking, analysis, and reporting features. It uses both English and Arabic, and provides public access to data on key accountability metrics. IDMS was developed in partnership with UNDP, USAID-Tatweer, the EU and UNOPS.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Tsunami recovery systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacificdisaster.net/pdnadmin/data/original/ADB_2006_PN40157_REG_TAR.pdf|title=Support for Strengthening the Tsunami Development Assistance Database|date=2006-06-01|website=|publisher=Asian Development Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Following the devastating [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] with the support of UNDP, Development Assistance Database was established in tsunami affected countries - Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand and Indonesia, to track financial and technical assistance, as well as results related to tsunami recovery work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/adboecdanti-corruptioninitiative/partnerships/36771059.pdf|title=Knowledge commitment action against corruption in Asia and the Pacific|date=2006-01-01|website=|publisher=Asian Development Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAD Sri Lanka''' – The Integrated National Development Information System (INDIS) was first introduced in Sri Lanka in 2005 following the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami to help the Government of Sri Lanka to track disaster needs, plan recovery programs and promote visibility and accountability in project spending and performance.&lt;ref name="Business Wire"/&gt; INDIS allowed reconstruction agencies to report their projects and share information on objectives, funding sources, implementation partners and project progress online, with the ultimate goal of facilitating efficient aid coordination.

'''DAD Indonesia''' - Synergy built the Recovery Aceh Nias (RAN) Database for the Government of Indonesia to support its coordination and management of the post-tsunami recovery effort. The RAN assisted the Government to align proposed projects with national reconstruction priorities, ensuring a coordinated plan for the delivery of aid. The RAN Database was the central tool for coordinating tsunami recovery activities and to date has tracked $3.7 billion in disbursements. Synergy was awarded the Innovative Government Technology Award in the Information Management category at the 2008 FutureGov Summit for the development of the Recovery Aceh Nias (RAN) Database installed for the BRR – Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency of the Government of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacificdisaster.net/pdnadmin/data/original/ADB_2009_PN40157_09REG_TACR.pdf|title=Regional: Support for Strengthening the Tsunami Development Assistance Database|last=Aidan Cox|date=2009-04-01|website=|publisher=Asian Development Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAD Maldives''' - Synergy was contracted by the government of Maldives to implemented the Development Assistance Database (DAD) that was later linked with the National Recovery Reconstruction Plan (NRRP). This helped to implement a key tenet of the Paris Declaration by “aligning” projects with national priorities as outlined in the NRRP and add the accountability mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/maldives/47865168.pdf|title=ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENT RESULTS,EVALUATION OF UNDP CONTRIBUTI ON MALDIVES|date=2010-03-01|website=|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAD Thailand''' - Synergy customized the DAD for the Thailand International Cooperation Agency located within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Launched in 2005, DAD Thailand, has significantly improved coordination and monitoring of the long-term international support to tsunami recovery in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/adboecdanti-corruptioninitiative/regionalseminars/35593179.pdf|title=Corruption, development and human rights – Fighting corruption as a means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals|last=Patrick Keuleers|date=|website=|publisher=UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific – Bangkok|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DAD Community of Practice ==
The Development Assistance Database (DAD) Community of Practice (CoP) is a global forum of practitioners who share a common commitment to advancing development effectiveness through the application of DAD.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africa-platform.org/sites/default/files/resources/DAD%20CoP%202011%20Synthesis%20Report.pdf|title=Taking Stock of the DAD Community of Practice 2009-2011|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major event of the DAD CoP is a biennial conference that brings together participants representing governments, aid agencies, civil society organizations, think-tanks, and the private sector. The conference centers on a workshop that features case studies in implementing DAD to improve management of development data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/46080636.pdf|title=South Africa—Development in the Southern African region|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In management, '''feed forward''' is giving a [[control system|control]] impact in a downlink to a subordinate to a person or an organization from which you are expecting an output. A feed forward is not just a pre-[[feedback]], as a feedback is always based on measuring an output and sending respective feedback. A pre-feedback given without measurement of output may be understood as a confirmation or just an acknowledgment of control command.

However, a feed forward is generally imposed before any willful change in output may occur. All other changes of output determined with feedback may for example result from [[distortion]], [[noise]] or [[attenuation]] It usually involves giving a document for review and giving an [[ex post]] information on that document which you have not already given.

However, social feedback is the response of the supreme hierarch to the subordinate as an acknowledgement of a subordinate's report on output, hence the subordinate's feedback to the supreme.

==Origin of term==

Feedforward as a management term has been used by Avraham Kluger since 2006 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maureenmckenna.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/feedforward-paper-2006-june.pdf |title=Feedforward first, Feedback later |author=Avraham Kluger |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marshall Goldsmith]] in one of his prominent management articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.medicine.umich.edu/sites/default/files/resources/feedforward.pdf |title=Want to Give Feedback? Rather Try Feedforward! |author=Marshall Goldsmith |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''future map''' is a method for building scenarios based on the collection of anticipated events.

The concept is based on the idea that a group of people who integrate the partial visions of its members into a common, shared, discussed, large enough, collection of anticipated events it can eventually reveal its own "shared future".

Because the [[Policy Analysis Market|FutureMap]] methodology is dynamic and implemented on a [[wiki]]-platform the Future projected by the group is constantly under revision. By process, the community learns how to adapt to future changes and increases its ability to face "unexpected events", it improves what the author calls its '''future-readiness'''.

In [[information technology consulting]] and [[management consulting]], '''a grade''' aims to explicitly recognize a certain professional level, both within the organization and to customer organizations. A grade is separated from a place in the line hierarchy of a company, it underlines the very possibility of recognizing a person (top) level without being necessarily in a management functions.

The most commonly used system of grading [[consultant]]s is the following:

*''Associate consultant'': In some fields, an associate consultant is at the beginning of their consulting career and will typically do work to support the consultants and senior consultants - data collection and analysis, workshop support, etc. An associate consultant can also refer to a day rate contractor at any level, differentiating them from an employee of the firm (e.g. associate managing consultant). However, in [[engineering]], [[urban planning]] and some environmental consulting fields the term ''Associate consultant'' is used differently and is typically a higher grade than ''Principal consultant''.
*''Consultant'': A consultant is ‘learning the trade' within a specific domain of expertise. A consultant is developing in most competency dimensions and work in different roles on different projects in a specific domain.
*''Senior consultant'': A senior consultant has developed a specialisation within a specific domain of expertise. A senior consultant is capable of working independently as well as in teams. A senior consultant is often responsible for the completion of a part of a project or activities for which he/she leads a small team. A senior consultant is more client oriented and explores sales activities.
*''Managing consultant'': A managing consultant has started to excel in some of the competency dimensions. A managing consultant is known for domain expertise and is capable of generating his or her own work and that of others. As such the managing consultant is often responsible for business volume, through (add-on) sales and delivering a project. A managing consultant can act as a team lead or counsellor for other team members.
*''Principal consultant'': A principal consultant has a strong business impact and is often part of the company's leadership. A principal consultant is capable of shaping a piece of business being the leader in a specific domain and in any other domains. A principal consultant develops high-level business relations and high-impact projects. A principal is capable of leading large teams and also generates new business ideas.

== Criticism of Davis Cup ==
Kosmos partnership with the International Tennis Federation to revamp the Davis Cup has been criticized by the tennis community. Many claim that the partnership will take away from the traditions of the 118-year-old tennis event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|title=Davis Cup revamp plans get mixed response|website=Espn.com|access-date=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523172112/http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|archive-date=2018-05-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a secret meeting held in Orlando, Florida, on August 16, 2018, the changes proposed by Kosmos received a 71 percent approval at the International Tennis Federation annual general meeting.

The '''LSE SU Alternative Investments Conference''' (also known as the '''LSE AIC''') is an international conference on [[hedge fund]]s, [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]] held annually in London, United Kingdom by the Alternative Investments Society (AIS), a Student’s Union society at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] (LSE).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lseaic.com/|title=Home - LSE AIC|website=LSE AIC|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Alternative Investments Society was founded in 2006 by a group of undergraduate students at the LSE, and continues to be run by students from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/about/|title=About - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Alternative Investments Conference was a one-day event hosted on the LSE campus in 2007, and was attended by 200 students who heard from several notable investors. The AIC has evolved considerably over its twelve-year history, having changed venues and ultimately becoming the world’s largest student conference on hedge funds, private equity and venture capital.

==Overview==

=== Format ===
The Conference takes place over two days at the five-star London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, bringing together over 40 senior level industry leaders (see [[LSE Alternative Investment Conference#Notable past speakers|notable past speakers]]) and 320 student delegates from many of the world’s leading educational institutions. Delegates come from a range of backgrounds, including both undergraduates and postgraduates studying finance, law, engineering, history as well as many other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/about/demographics/|title=Demographics - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the Conference is competitive, with only 4.3% of applicants to AIC 2017 being selected to attend.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Conference is international in character, with applicants coming from over 200 universities located across more than 120 countries world wide.

The format of the Conference sees delegates attend keynote speeches, panel discussions and workshop sessions designed to allow for them to learn from and interact with experienced professionals from within the investment community. Networking events are also held during the Conference by the AIC’s partner firms, as well as a dinner for all attending delegates hosted during the evening of the first day of the event. Sponsor firms of the AIC include [[Point72 Asset Management]], [http://www.dartmouthpartners.com Dartmouth Partners], [[Canada Pension Plan Investment Board]], [[Terra Firma Capital Partners]], [[GAM (company)|GAM,]] [https://amicusplc.co.uk Amicus], [[Bain &amp; Company]], [[Bain Capital]], [[3i]], [[Patron Capital]], [[Lansdowne Partners]], [http://www.stableam.com/disclaimer.asp Stable Asset Management], and [[Dechert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/sponsors/|title=Sponsors - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Managerial economics'''  deals with the application of the economic concepts, theories, tools, and methodologies to solve practical problems in a business. It helps the manager in decision making and acts as a link between practice and theory".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Allen, Managerial Economics
Theory, Applications, and Cases, 7th Edition. Norton. [http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-contents.aspx?ID=13385 Contents].&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as [[business economics]] and is a branch of [[economics]] that applies [[microeconomic]] analysis to decision methods of businesses or other management units.

==Overview==
Managerial decision areas includes:
* assessment of investible funds
* selecting business area
* choice of product.
* determining optimum output.
* sales promotion.
 
Almost any business decision can be analyzed with managerial economics techniques, but it is most commonly applied to:
* ''Risk analysis'' – various models are used to quantify [[risk]] and asymmetric [[Information economics|information]] and to employ them in [[decision theory|decision rules]] to manage risk.&lt;ref&gt;• James O. Berger (2008)."statistical decision theory," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.

* ''Production analysis'' – microeconomic techniques are used to analyze [[production theory basics|production efficiency]], [[optimum factor allocation]], [[cost]]s, [[economies of scale]] and to estimate the firm's cost function.
* ''Pricing analysis'' – microeconomic techniques are used to analyze various [[pricing|pricing decisions]] including [[transfer pricing]], [[joint product pricing]], [[price discrimination]], price elasticity estimations, and choosing the optimum pricing method.
* ''Capital budgeting'' – investment theory is used to examine a firm's [[Corporate finance#The investment decision|capital purchasing decisions]].&lt;ref&gt;• Trefor Jones (2004).

At universities, the subject is taught primarily to advanced undergraduates and graduate business students. It is approached as an integration subject. That is, it integrates many concepts from a wide variety of prerequisite courses. In many countries it is possible to read for a degree in Business Economics which often covers managerial economics, [[financial economics]], [[game theory]], business [[forecasting]] and [[industrial economics]].

== Scope ==
Managerial economics to a certain degree is prescriptive in nature as it suggests course of action to a managerial problem. Problems can be related to various departments in a firm like production, accounts, sales, etc.

(a) Operational issues
# Demand decision
# Production decision
# Theory of exchange or price theory
# All human economic activity

(b) Environmental issues
# Nature and trend of domestic business/ international environment
# nature and impact of social costs and government policy

==Demand decision ==
[[Demand]] is the willingness of potential customers to buy a commodity. It defines the market size for a commodity, and at a disaggregated level the composition of the customer base. Analysis of demand is important for a firm as its revenue, profits, and income of its employees depend on it.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. M.S. BHAT, and mk RAU.Managerial economic and financial analysis.Hyderabad.{{ISBN|978-81-7800-153-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Managing by Wire''' is a [[management]] strategy for enterprises of a dynamically changing [[Market (economics)|markets]] with a high level of concurrency.

The concept forces switching from a conventional make-and-sell model to sense and response to the rapidly changing customer needs using most modern [[Information technology|information technologies]]. As an analogue a [[fly-by-wire]] concept invented in 1950s for jets is presented. According to fly-by-wire a pilot must focus on general flight parameters while information technologies control the plain and reacts to changing environment.

== History ==
Managing by Wire was first presented in [[Harvard Business Review|''Harvard Business Review'']] in 1993 by [[Stephan H. Haeckel|Stephan Haeckel]] and Richard Nolan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1993/09/managing-by-wire|title=Managing by Wire|author=Stephan H. Haeckel and Richard Nolan|first=|date=1993-10-13|work=|access-date=|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key principles ==
The key principle is to create a digital model of the enterprise describing (at the most available detail level) processes taking part. As a digital model is created managing of the enterprise must move their focus from manipulating real-world processes to the programming procedures and changes to the digital model, which in turn influence to the real-world processes.

The '''McGill Executive Institute''' is the corporate education and management development unit of the [[McGill University]] [[Desautels Faculty of Management]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It provides a variety of public business seminars as well as custom [[executive education]] and coaching for all levels of management.

Founded in 1956,&lt;ref name="computers"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1308%2C2644596 McGill Management Institute teaches the unusual...it’s where executives go to learn about computers], The Montreal Gazette, Aug 18, 1984, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute has a full-time staff of learning design and program managers working with professors at McGill’s Faculties of Management, Law, Arts, Education and Medicine, external guest experts in specific fields, as well as visiting professors from universities worldwide. The Institute’s clientele includes businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government/public sector services.

==History==

After establishing the first management diploma in 1906, McGill University began offering evening classes in business education in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2010-2011/sites/mcgill.ca.study.2010-2011/files/desautels_faculty_of_management_201011_0.pdf  Desautels Faculty of Management: Programs, Courses and University Regulations 2010-2011], Desautels Website, PDF retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following Canada's post World War II expansion, McGill University responded to the needs of senior executives by offering seminars in personnel management, marketing, and finance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EIMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20personnel-management&amp;pg=3548%2C915652 McGill University Evening Extension Course listing], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 8, 1950, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent to business seminars offered by McGill, the Executive Development Institute, a private business education organization, began to offer the Executive Development Course (EDC) in 1949, in affiliation with the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. It was developed with support from the Graduate School of Business at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vJgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kZ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3255%2C552133 Executive Development Institute, 12th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 5, 1961, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aMItAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=montreal%20board-of-trade%20seminar%20institute%20executive&amp;pg=4026%2C1105140 Executive Development Institute, 13th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 7, 1962, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W8MtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_Z4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=1953%2C316811 Executive Development Institute, 15th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 3, 1964, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A precursor to the existence of many MBA and later EMBA programs, the EDC was designed to provide a comprehensive look at management practices in strategy, human resources, marketing, negotiations and financial acumen.&lt;ref name="computers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3272%2C1782776 To Help the Executive Grow], The Montreal Gazette - Jul 11, 1963, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the McGill Management Institute was founded to facilitate the more effective delivery of business seminars offered at McGill University.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt; In 1973, the Executive Development Institute merged with the McGill Management Institute and, under the McGill banner, continued the facilitation of the EDC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UhQyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3qEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1486%2C4031929 Ross Plans Book on University Growth], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 31, 1973, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zYcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=5535%2C2565363 Psychological Survival for Executives], The Montreal Gazette - April 10, 1974, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The merger coincided with a move to its current home in the Bronfman building at McGill University on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, where it underwent a significant expansion of its offerings. By 1984, the McGill Management Institute was offering 70 day-time seminars and 20 evening courses each year, in addition to the EDC.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt;

In 1993, the McGill Management Institute was renamed the McGill International Executive Institute. It took its current name, the McGill Executive Institute, in 2002. It is a division of the [[Desautels Faculty of Management]].

==Philosophy==

The McGill Executive Institute has been noted for its approach to action-based learning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 213, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for its international dimension. In his 2009 work, ''Executive Education in Canadian Firms'', Bruce Gordon R. Fowler states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The executive programs at this Institute recognize better than most schools, even among the other eight illustrious institutions discussed here, the need for international diversity and content. Indeed, McGill has been recognized as having an international dimension unsurpassed in North America for diversity among students and faculty, and for program style and content. The scope of McGill's global outlook is certainly equal to that of Harvard and INSEAD, also featured here as giants of international connectivity, which simply must be part of any program involving  executives of international or multinational firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 138, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Products and Services==
Each year, the McGill Executive Institute provides approximately 20 to 40 open enrolment seminars addressing a number of business topics. The Institute’s longest running program is the Executive Development Course which was launched in 1949. The EDC has been expanded over the years, and is currently offered in three successive modules: the Executive Development Course, the Advanced Management Course, and Integrated Management Thinking. Together, these are referred to by the Institute as the [[Mini-MBA]] Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://executive.mcgill.ca/seminars List of Seminars available from McGill Executive Institute website], Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The McGill Executive Institute also designs and delivers customized learning solutions specifically for an organization’s team of managers or executives.  Services range from short workshops delivered in English, French or bilingual formats to global initiatives with delivery of modules to participants across management levels over several years.

The McGill Executive Institute also offers an International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM), as well as the Advanced Leadership Program (ALP). These longer, global programs occur over several modules and across multiple international locations, in conjunction with other universities: The Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India; Lancaster University in the UK; Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management in Seoul, Korea; and INSEAD in France. Both the ALP and the IMPM were co-founded and are co-directed by Professor [[Henry Mintzberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 135, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty and Guest Speakers==

Well-known McGill faculty members include Professor [[Henry Mintzberg]] on advanced leadership issues and Professor Nancy Adler on [[organizational behavior]]. Recent guest speakers of note have included business leaders [[Daniel Lamarre]], [[Larry Smith (Canadian football)|Larry Smith]], Jim Cherry, Alan Allnutt, Paul Côté and [[Pierre Boivin]].

==Partners and Collaborators==

The McGill Executive Institute partners with the [[Institute of Corporate Directors]] (ICD) in Canada to deliver the Director’s Education Program. It is also a registered education provider with the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) and collaborates with the Canadian Corporate Counsel Association to deliver development programs for lawyers on financial literacy.

'''Memorandum of conversation''' (abbrev.: '''MEMCON''') and also '''memorandum of a conversation''' and '''memo to the file''' refers to a method of contemporaneous documentation of a conversation in the form of a [[memorandum]] used by the [[federal government of the United States|United States federal government]].&lt;Ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;Ref name=memfile /&gt;

''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' characterized the use of the tactic in the U.S. government as among "the most basic ways of Washington".&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

==Method==
Typically an individual will document the events of the conversation as soon as possible after the occurrence.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference.&lt;ref name=memcon&gt;{{citation|first=Lawrence|last=O'Donnell|authorlink=Lawrence O'Donnell|work=[[The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=May 16, 2017|title=MEMCON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/findingaid/Memoranda_of_Conversations.asp|title=Summary Description|work=National Security Adviser. Memoranda of Conversations, 1973-1977|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]]|access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in-depth within the memo.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=memfile&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/a-brief-history-of-the-memo-to-the-file/article/2008086|first=Eric|last=Felten|title=A Brief History of the 'Memo to the File'|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[special agent]]s commonly make use of memoranda of conversation.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions.&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

Memoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the [[fraud]] unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, "the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events."&lt;ref name=sennewald&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles A.|last1= Sennewald|first2=John K.|last2= Tsukayama|title=The Process of Investigation: Concepts and Strategies for Investigators in the Private Sector|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|year=2015|pages=189-90|isbn=978-0128001660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of [[Gerald R.

'''Mobile enterprise asset management''' (or mobile EAM) refers to the mobile extension of work processes for maintenance, operations and repair of corporate or public-entity physical [[assets]], equipment, buildings and grounds. It involves management of [[work orders]] (planned, break/fix or service requests) via communication between a mobilized workforce and computer systems to maintain an organization’s facilities, structures and other assets.

The idea behind mobile EAM as a business practice is that it enables remote workers – employees who spend part or all of their time away from a central office – access to data from the organization’s computer [[application software]] for [[enterprise asset management]] (commonly referred to as an [[enterprise system]], EAM system or backend system), typically using a [[handheld]] or other mobile computer. This is to distinguish from the term [[mobile asset management]], which refers more broadly to the actual tools, instruments and containers organizations use to track and secure equipment and other such assets frequently on the move.

In the mobile EAM process, the organization eliminates a need for paper forms or other [[data reporting]] and communication methods ([[push-to-talk]] and radio) to move work order information to and from the point where the work is being performed.

While [[enterprise asset management]] encompasses the management of an organization’s entire asset portfolio across processes including equipment addition/ reduction, replacement, over-hauling, redundancy setup and maintenance budgets, mobile enterprise asset management is focused, by definition, strictly on the [[wireless]] automation of asset management data for such processes.

== Mobile EAM technology ==

When viewed and used on a handheld device, mobile work order applications provide details such as location, stepwise job plans, safety alerts, [[lock-outs]] and prior work history on the asset, giving a maintenance technician or other remote worker more detailed asset information as well as the ability to transmit work data to the organization’s enterprise system when completed – through a [[wireless network]], [[docking station]] or other synchronization method.

Using computer software to achieve standard mobile EAM practices, organizations often report such advantages as an increase in timely, accurate data flow between their remote workers and central management such as planners and schedulers, which thereby improves capital and labor allocation decision processes (including an ability to schedule more planned/[[preventive maintenance]] work).  
 
With the proliferation of [[smartphone]] and other mobile computing technologies, asset managers can expect an ever more tech-savvy workforce, lower costs in mobile devices and a higher propensity of feature-rich, workflow-specific mobile applications.

== Challenges ==
Nearly all challenges in mobile EAM practices can be traced to two factors: time and labor resources (including IT or [[information technology]] management) and investment costs.

Developing and implementing a mobile application architecture on the enterprise scale is not an easy undertaking by any means, as mobile applications are faced with a diversity of device [[operating systems]], output media (voice and data) and connectivity methods, contrasting with a PC ([[personal computer]]) environment where in most cases software requires relatively few, if major, updates and lower upfront costs. Organizations looking to implement mobile EAM applications often seek the help of [[technology consulting]] firms and spend months researching, planning and selecting an implementation strategy.

== Industries using mobile EAM ==
The use of [[mobile enterprise]] application platforms (MEAPs),&lt;ref name=gartner&gt;http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=172728&lt;/ref&gt; designed around [[service-oriented architecture]] principles for multiple [[systems integration]] and custom modification, and other forms of wireless computing technology for mobile EAM solutions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobileenterprisemag.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=MultiPublishing&amp;mod=PublishingTitles&amp;mid=B4771C6F22F34E4CA3FFFDA61E0EA2C5&amp;tier=4&amp;id=CEFEEBFEA2484118849FC7820858E920&lt;/ref&gt; is growing rapidly, particularly in industries where physical assets form a significant cost proportion of organizations’ total assets. These industries can include:
 
* [[Facilities management]]
* [[Utilities]]
* [[Life sciences]]
* [[Government organizations]]
* [[Manufacturing]]
* [[Oil and gas industry]]
* [[Transportation industry]]

In such high-value asset scenarios, the asset lifecycle improvements introduced by the increase in enterprise data flow of mobile EAM processes can bring significant savings, particularly when part of an enterprise-wide capital and labor management strategy that integrates multiple systems in an [[enterprise architecture]] (EAM system, mobile EAM application, labor dispatch/[[Employee scheduling software|scheduling software]], [[GIS]], etc.).

== Market growth ==
In a 2009 study,&lt;ref name=gartner/&gt; market analyst [[Gartner]], Inc. forecasted, “for the MEAP and packaged mobile application market…we now expect market growth annually of 15 to 20% through 2013.” Gartner attributes this anticipated growth to enterprises’ increasing willingness (and ability) to extend decision-relevant information to employees, who are themselves increasingly mobile.

For EAM practices as a whole, this means that an increasing proportion of organizations in capital-intensive industry sectors (such as those above) are adopting mobile technology as an integral part of their enterprise asset management strategy – corresponding with an enterprise-wide emphasis on whole life planning, life cycle costing, planned and proactive maintenance and other industry [[best practices]].

'''Operation Enterprise''' (or OE) is a [[high school]] and [[college]] [[student]] program sponsored by the [[American Management Association]].

==History==
Established in 1963, OE is a [[leadership training]] and [[career development]] program held on college campuses around the country, typically during June and July. It is designed to teach the necessary skills to succeed in [[business]]. The intensive, eight-day residential experience focuses on [[management]], [[negotiation]], [[conflict resolution]], [[strategic planning]] and [[ethics]], and improves the student's [[leadership]], [[communication skills|communication]] and [[presentation skills]].

Since its inception, more than 10,000 students have participated in OE.

'''PaperWorks''' was a [[computer program]] introduced by [[Xerox Corporation]] in 1992, which allowed a business traveler to [[communicate]] with his or her [[personal computer]] while away from the [[office]].

PaperWorks could be used to send and retrieve documents between the fixed computer system and the business traveler, by using [[fax]] machines.  

The software created special [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] [[Form (document)|forms]], similar to the type of forms used to score [[standardized tests]].  (Related topic: [[Optical mark recognition|OMR]])

The [[user (computing)|user]] would then [[fax]] the form back to the central computer, commanding one of several tasks to be performed.  For example:
* the user could attach a document to the form which would be stored at the home office (for possible later processing), or 
* the user could request that a particular [[document]], stored on the computer's [[hard drive]], be sent to the user.
* the user could request that a particular [[document]] be distributed to other users, also by fax.

The underlying technology for PaperWorks, called "[[DataGlyphs]]"[http://www.dataglyphs.com], was developed at [[Xerox PARC]].

{{Property law}}
'''Practicing without a license''' is the act of working without the [[licensure]] offered for that occupation, in a particular [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Springhouse"&gt;Springhouse Corporation. (2004) ''Nurse's legal handbook.'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, {{ISBN|9781582552804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most activities that require licensure also have penalties for practicing without a valid, current license.&lt;ref name="Galaty"&gt;Galaty, Fillmore W. et al. (2001) ''Modern Real Estate Practice in Illinois.'' Dearborn Trade Publishing, {{ISBN|9780793142576}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, a license is offered but not required for some professions.&lt;ref name="unlicensed-practitioner.com"&gt;[http://unlicensed-practitioner.com/69/ "Practicing Your Profession In Oregon Without a License, Legally and Ethically"] Oregon Unlicensed Practitioners, December 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Fields where practicing without a license may carry civil or criminal penalties include [[lawyer]], [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[optometrist]], [[podiatry|podiatrist]], [[surgeon]], [[coroner]], [[medical examiner]], [[paramedic]], [[funeral director]], [[osteopath]], [[chiropractor]], [[dentist]], [[pharmacist]], [[engineer]], [[Aviator|pilot]], [[broadcasting]], [[nurse]], [[veterinarian]], [[midwife]], [[teacher]], [[psychologist]], [[surveying|surveyor]], [[detective]], [[social worker]], [[architect]], [[barber]], [[hairdresser]], [[electrologist]], [[tattooist]], [[cosmetologist]], [[real estate agent]], [[plumber]], [[florist]], [[accountant]], and [[masseuse]]. If a person offering their services is licensed in one of these professions, any member of the public has a right to know if that person is validly licensed or not by the licensing authority. Anyone who claims to have a license and refuses to identify themselves properly by first and last name can possibly lose any one or all of their licenses. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal for service providers to hide their identities for purposes of making it difficult to verify licensure and past disciplinary actions or license violations.

License requirements vary widely with jurisdiction, sometimes even within a single country. Practicing a professional discipline without a license may be legal in some jurisdictions. For example, nine U.S. states have passed  [[health freedom movement|health freedom laws]] that protect alternative practitioners such as herbalists from prosecution for "practicing medicine without a license."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhealthfreedom.org/InfoCenter/laws_passed.html "Health Freedom Laws Passed"] National Health Freedom Coalition, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of mental health, Oregon offers broad licensing exemptions for [[licensed professional counselor|professional counselors]] and [[Relationship counseling|marriage and family therapists]], allowing people to practice these professions either with or without a license.&lt;ref name="unlicensed-practitioner.com"/&gt; Colorado requires registration but not licensing for [[psychotherapy|psychotherapists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradopsychotherapists.com/page-1435658? "An Historical Overview of CAPS Legislative Activities"] Colorado Association of Psychotherapists, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other states also have exemptions or registration requirements instead of, or in addition to licensing for some professions.

===Other unlicensed activity===

Other occupations, such as operating a business or working as a [[professional driver]] or [[mariner]], may require specialized licensure as well. Operating a business without proper licenses can result in financial and sometimes criminal penalties. These licenses can include a general [[business license]], a [[liquor license]], a specialized [[drivers license]], and other types regulated by local, regional, state, or federal requirements. Certain occupations may require obtaining appropriate [[intellectual property]] licenses, such as [[music licensing]], [[brand licensing]], [[patent licensing]], [[software licensing]], and other permissions for use.

Non-professional activities may also require licenses for participation. These include [[driver's license]], [[amateur radio license]], [[dog license]], [[firearms license]], [[hunting license]], [[marriage license]], [[pilot license]]. Using certain products or services may also require obtaining a license, such as a [[software license]]. Operating without these licenses can lead to civil and criminal penalties.

Penalties vary depending on the severity of the infraction, but practicing without a valid, current license may be punishable by one or more methods, including [[community service]], [[fine (penalty)|fine]], [[restitution]], [[probation]] and temporary or permanent loss of the license. Criminal charges can lead to [[incarceration]], as they can range from a [[misdemeanor]] to a [[felony]], depending on the severity of the infraction.&lt;ref name="Circo"&gt;Circo, Carl J. [ed.] (2009) ''A State-by-state Guide to Construction &amp; Design Law: Current Statutes and Practices.'' [[American Bar Association]], {{ISBN|9781604425543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted incidents==
On July 6, 1885, [[Louis Pasteur]], a [[chemist]] who was a pioneer in [[microbiology]], treated [[Joseph Meister]] after the boy was mauled by a dog infected with [[rabies]] with a vaccination treatment that had thus far only been tested on animals. This was technically illegal considering Pasteur was not a licensed [[physician]], but he and his colleagues agreed that it was necessary considering his treatment seemed the only way to save the boy from a likely death. the treatment was successful, Pasteur was feted as a hero, and charges were never filed.&lt;ref name="murphy2004"&gt;Murphy, Timothy F. (2004) ''Case Studies Biomedical Research Ethics.'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262632867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another more modern example is the case of [[Frank Abagnale]], who was accused of impersonating an airline pilot, lawyer, and [[teaching assistant]].

The "yogurt defense" was made famous by the trial of Carol Downer, one of the developers of [[menstrual extraction]]. She was arrested at her self-help group and charged with practicing medicine without a license, as she inserted yogurt into the vagina of another woman to treat a yeast condition.  Carol Downer was acquitted; the jury did not equate inserting yogurt with practicing medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzek, Sheryl Burt. (1978) "The Women's Health Movement Feminist Alternatives to Medical Control," New York: Praeger Publishers. p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]] is a Japanese comic book series created by [[Tezuka Osamu]] that is about the world's greatest surgeon, who chooses to remain unlicensed. This allows Black Jack to charge extortionate amounts of money instead of the standard fees agreed upon by the [[Japanese Medical Association]]. It also lets him perform extremely dangerous, often medically implausible or impossible operations, that are not legally allowed. Black Jack is often viewed as the Japanese equivalent to [[Batman]], in his willingness to routinely break laws to save lives for which he is frequently imprisoned by the police. It is notable that Black Jack actually completed his college medical education and carries a driver's license, though he encourages other unlicensed doctors who have no such formal training. Like many of Osamu's works, Black Jack is extraordinarily critical of the medical establishment, and is notable for raising Japanese public awareness of medical corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osamu Tezuka: Father of manga and scourge of the medical establishment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/jul/21/medical-manga-osamu-tezuka|author=Cian O'Luanaigh|year=2010|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of [[superhero]]es in comic books investigate crimes without detectives' licenses. In [[Detective Comics]], [[Question (comics)|The Question]], [[Dick Grayson]], [[Detective Chimp]] [[John Constantine]] and John Jones/[[Martian Manhunter]] are all licensed detectives or police officers, while [[Wally West]], the third [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] is a professional crime scene investigator. [[Jonah Hex]] is a bounty hunter operating under the loose legal framework of the wild west. The [[Green Lantern]] Corps patrol the D.C. universe and enforce the ancient intergalactic laws of the guardians of Oa. In [[Marvel Comics]], [[Frank Castle]] used to be a policeman, but after his wife and child were shot to death, he left the force forever and became the mass murdering vigilante [[The Punisher]].

Batman is one of only three members of the Justice League with any medical training but is the only one who lacks an official doctorate and license to practice medicine. Nevertheless, he occasionally performs surgery on his teammates despite being the son of the doctor [[Thomas Wayne]]. In Marvel Comics, the former neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, in desperate search of a cure for his crippled hands, wasted all of his money on alternative medicine, which did not heal him. Homeless, [[Doctor Strange]] performed back alley surgeries for cash, barely able to hold the instruments.

[[Victor Frankenstein]], though often incorrectly referred to as a doctor, is only a medical student, and as such operated on his monster without a license. Prior to the monster's vivification, Frankenstein and his assistant Igor were also acting as unlicensed morticians.

The movie [[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]], among other historical inaccuracies, showed the title character practicing medicine without a license, and getting his equipment by stealing from a hospital.

The [[USA Network]] drama ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]''' protagonist, Michael "Mike" Ross, gets a high-flying job at the fictitious Pearson Hardman law firm without having the necessary license to practice law.

'''Root Cause Analysis Solver Engine''' (informally '''RCASE''') is a proprietary [[algorithm]] developed from research originally at the [[Warwick Manufacturing Group|Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG)]] at [[Warwick University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Warwick Analytical Software Limited|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=244987022|publisher=[[Business Week]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturing Global, Emerging Predictive Analytics for the Manufacturing Industries|url=http://issuu.com/manufacturingglobal/docs/manufacturing_global_-_november_201/23?e=12487208/9845812|publisher=[[Issuu]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCASE development commenced in 2003 to provide an automated version of [[root cause analysis]], the method of problem solving that tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Academia Meets The Real World, The Experience Can Be Life-altering: A First Person Perspective by Dan Sommers, Warwick Analytics|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/bizspark_featured_startups/archive/2014/02/27/when-academia-meets-the-real-world-the-experience-can-be-life-altering-a-first-person-perspective-by-dan-sommers-warwick-analytics.aspx|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=TechNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCASE is now owned by the spin-out company [[Warwick Analytics]] where it is being applied to automated predictive analytics software.

==Algorithm==
The algorithm has been built from the ground up to be particularly suitable for the following situations:
* [[Dirty data|'dirty' data]]
* incomplete data
* big data
* small datasets
* complex problems for example multi-modal failure or with more than one solution
RCASE is considered to be an innovator in the field of [[Predictive analytics]] and falls within the category of ''[[Pattern recognition#Classification algorithms .28supervised algorithms predicting categorical labels.29|classification algorithms]]''. Because it was built to handle the data types above, it has been proven to have many advantages over other types of classification algorithms and [[Machine learning#Software|machine learning]] algorithms such as [[decision trees]], [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[Regression analysis|regression techniques]]. It does not require [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturing 4.0 – From Industrialisation to Data-Driven Product Lifecycle|url=http://citizentekk.com/2013/11/05/manufacturing-4-0-industrialisation-data-driven-product-lifecycle/|publisher=Citizen Tekk|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Removing hypotheses for fault-finding in Six Sigma to revolutionise quality management|url=http://www.supplychaindigital.com/logistics/3398/Removing-hypotheses-for-faultfinding-in-Six-Sigma-to-revolutionise-quality-management|publisher=Supply Chain Digital|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has since been commercialised and made available for operating systems such as [[SAP SE|SAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAP to boost growth opportunities, deliver innovation with disruptive solutions from partner tie-ups|url=http://www.informationweek.in/informationweek/news-analysis/277234/sap-boost-growth-opportunities-deliver-innovation-disruptive-solutions-partner-tie-ups|publisher=[[InformationWeek]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teradata]] and [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAP Spurs Innovation by Powering More Than 500 Startups Globally With SAP HANA|url=http://www.news-sap.com/sap-spurs-innovation-by-powering-more-than-500-startups-globally-with-sap-hana/|publisher=[[SAP SE]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCASE originated from manufacturing and is widely used in applications such as [[Six Sigma]], [[quality control]] and [[engineering]], [[product design]] and warranty issues. However it is also used in other industries such as [[e-commerce]], [[financial services]] and utilities where root cause analysis is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How German-based SAP is creating a startup ecosystem from Silicon Valley|url=http://pando.com/2013/07/19/how-german-based-sap-is-creating-a-startup-ecosystem-from-silicon-valley/|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=[[Pando Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable applications==
[[Motorola]], the home of [[Six Sigma]], used the research technology behind RCASE to support their quality processes. It was used to eliminate ''[[No Fault Found]]'' quality issues for a particular mobile phone model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced analytics solves 'No Fault Found' issues|url=http://www.manufacturingdigital.com/technology/advanced-analytics-solves-no-fault-found-issues|publisher=[[Warwick Manufacturing Group]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism &amp; architecture==
RCASE is non-statistical and thus does not require any [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analytical software could solve mass product recall problems|url=http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2010/oct/warwick-analytics.cfm|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=[[Engineering and Technology Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the key parameters causing the issue or fault in a process are not present in a [[dataset]], it will still narrow the search space and advise where the root cause may lie. This is a different approach to statistical theories which try to find a [[best fit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warwick Analytics pioneers manufacturing fault finder software|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/channels/production-engineering/software/warwick-analytics-pioneers-manufacturing-fault-finder-software/1007594.article|publisher=[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RCASE is based on optimised combinatorial theory and runs on either a grid cluster or a [[High-performance computing|high performance]] [[in-memory database]]. The software will interface with all [[Manufacturing execution system|MES]] and [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Midlands Company could solve mass vehicle recall problems|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/midlands_company_could/|publisher=University of Warwick|date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a security system monitoring and preventing defective products from being produced. The output from the analysis will be markers that identify either an exact root cause of failure or a parametric region pointing high probability of failure (i.e. data-driven guidance on where to look next to gather data and resolve the root cause exactly).&lt;ref name=ebr&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Big Data to Achieve Zero Defects|url=http://www.businessrevieweurope.eu/magazines/14442|publisher=European Business Review|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software can be installed on Linux or Microsoft operating systems and deployed as [[On-premises software|On-Premises]] or [[Software as a service|Software-as-a-Service]] (“SaaS” or “cloud”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warwick Analytics Revolutionises Manufacturing Processes at DEMO Fall 2013|url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read/25388103/Warwick_Analytics_Revolutionises_Manufacturing_Processes_at_DEMO_Fall_2013_|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

The '''Saltire Prize''', named after the [[flag of Scotland]], is the national award for advances in the commercial development of [[marine energy]].

To be considered for the £10 million award teams must demonstrate, in [[Scottish waters]], a commercially viable [[Wave energy|wave]] or [[tidal stream energy]] technology "that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea."

The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltireprize.com/challenge |title=The Challenge | publisher=saltireprize.com |accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already there are five competitors registered.

==Additional prizes==

• The '''Saltire Prize Lecture''' - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring.  The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government.

• The '''Saltire Prize Medal''' - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner.

• The '''Junior Saltire Prize''' - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential.  It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6.

• A '''Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate''' in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012.  The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment.

• '''Power of the Sea''' - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy.	In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners.

The '''Sohn Conference Foundation''' was founded in 2006 to raise money to support medical research, the development of research equipment, and programs to help children with cancer and other childhood illnesses. {{As of|2018}} more than $85 million has been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sohn-live-blog-top-investors-pitch-their-best-ideas-2018-04-23|title=Hedge-fund managers offer their top stock-market picks: Sohn live blog|last=Vlastelica|first=William Watts, Ryan|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sohn Conference was founded in 1995 in memory of Ira Sohn, a [[Wall Street]] professional, who died of [[cancer]] at the age of 29. At that time the Conference raised money for Tomorrow’s Children’s Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sohnconference.org/about/mission/|title=About Us {{!}} Sohn|last=Foundation|first=Sohn Conference|date=2015-11-13|newspaper=Sohn Conference Foundation|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation has 501(c)(3) non-profit status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reg.sohnconference.com/sohndonation/index.aspx|title=Sohn Conference Foundation|last=Foundation|first=Sohn Conference|website=reg.sohnconference.com|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created after the premature death from cancer of Ira W. Sohn, by his friends and colleagues Douglas Hirsch, Lance Laifer and Daniel Nir, together with Sohn’s mother Judith Sohn and brother Evan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.beaconwealthmanagement.com/things-you-didnt-hear-from-the-sohn-investment-conference|title=Things You Didn't Hear from the Sohn Investment Conference|last=Powell|first=Tina|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, the Foundation and [[CNBC]] announced a partnership to present the Sohn Investment Conferences in collaboration. The first conference presented as a partnership took place in New York City on May 4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/09/the-sohn-conference-foundation-and-cnbc-strike-groundbreaking-global-partnership-for-renowned-sohn-investment-conferences.html|title=The Sohn Conference Foundation and CNBC Strike Groundbreaking Global Partnership for Renowned Sohn Investment Conferences|last=CNBC|date=2016-03-09|website=CNBC|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute''' or SWF Institute, or SWFI, is a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as [[sovereign wealth fund]]s and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds.  It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute is a [[financial data vendor]] but provides information to the media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Susanna|title=Why Norwegians Are Millionaires and Americans Are Paupers |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/norwegians-millionaires-norways-sovereign-wealth-fund/story?id=21488085|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blas|first=Javier|title=Protecting Nigeria oil SWF is no easy task |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69325c28-2440-11e3-a8f7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2qJ6YUFpy|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedine|first=Saad|title=Body of Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund chief found |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/30/uae.body/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Michael Maduell]] and Carl Linaburg in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=Is there an SWF in your future? |url=http://www.irmagazine.com/articles/shareholder-targeting-id/20204/there-swf-your-future/|publisher=IR Magazine|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI sells data subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities.

==Transparency Ratings==
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan ranks among the highest in Transparency Index |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/news/558/100/The-State-Oil-Fund-of-the-Republic-of-Azerbaijan-ranks-among-the-highest-in-Transparency-Index.asp|publisher=SOFAZ|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSIA Rated Transparent by Sovereign Wealth Institute |url=http://nsia.com.ng/nsia-rated-transparent-sovereign-wealth-institute/|publisher=Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds.  The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dan |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI tracks the assets of sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments and other asset owners.  Norway's sovereign wealth fund crossed $1 trillion in assets in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norway’s sovereign-wealth fund passes the $1trn mark |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729458-5m-odd-norwegians-own-more-1-all-shares-world-norways/|publisher=The Economist|date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6489">In [[economics]], '''willingness to accept''' ('''WTA''') is the minimum amount of money that а person is willing to accept to abandon a good or to put up with something negative, such as [[pollution]]. It is equivalent to the minimum monetary amount required for sale of a good or acquisition of something undesirable to be accepted by an individual. Conversely, '''willingness to pay''' ('''WTP''') is the maximum amount an individual is willing to sacrifice to procure a good or avoid something undesirable.  The price of any goods transaction will thus be any point between a buyer's willingness to pay and a seller's willingness to accept.  The net difference between WTP and WTA is the social surplus created by the trading of goods.

Several methods have been developed to measure consumer willingness to pay or accept payment. These methods can be differentiated whether they measure consumers' hypothetical or actual willingness to pay or accept and whether they measure consumer willingness to pay or accept directly or indirectly.

[[Choice modelling]] techniques may be used to estimate the value of the WTP or WTA through a choice experiment.

Unlike WTP, WTA is not constrained by an individual's wealth.  For example, the willingness to pay to stop the ending of one's own life can only be as high as one's wealth, while the willingness to accept compensation to accept the loss of one's life would be an extremely high number (or maybe infinite, meaning that there would be no finite acceptable payment amount).

==Formal definition==

Let ''u''(''w'', ''x'') be an individual's [[utility function]], where ''w'' is the person's wealth and ''x'' is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 in the presence of an undesired feature and takes the value 0 in the absence of that feature. The utility function is assumed to be increasing in wealth and decreasing in ''x''. Also, define ''w''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as the person's initial wealth.  Then the "willingness to accept" is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;u(w_0 + WTA , 1) = u(w_0 , 0).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, John Keith and Mcconnell, Kenneth, (2003), [http://www.ag.unr.edu/moeltner/APEC%20464_664/Spring_07/pdf/Horowitz_McConnell_2003.pdf "Willingness to accept, willingness to pay and the income effect"], ''Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization'', Vol. 51, No. 4, p.&amp;nbsp;537–545.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095243/http://www.ag.unr.edu/moeltner/APEC%20464_664/Spring_07/pdf/Horowitz_McConnell_2003.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, the willingness to accept payment in order to put up with the adverse change equates the pre-change utility (on the right side) with the post-change utility including compensation.

In contrast, the ''willingness to pay'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;u(w_0 - WTP, 0)= u(w_0, 1).&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the willingness to pay to avoid the adverse change equates the post-change utility, diminished by the presence of the adverse change (on the right side), with utility without the adverse change but with payment having been made to avoid it.

The concept extends readily to a context of uncertain outcomes, in which case the utility function above is replaced by the [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected value of a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function]].

==Standard theory versus experimental results==
The standard assumptions of economic theory imply that when income effects are small, the gap between WTP and WTA should be negligible. Thus [[indifference curve]]s are drawn without reference to current endowments. This leads to the wide acceptance of the ''[[Coase theorem]]'' assertion that, subject to income effects, the allocation of resources will be independent of the assignment of property rights when costless trades are possible. This is to say, the allocation of property rights does not influence the way externalities are internalized by the market. However, many experiments, such as that by [[Daniel Kahneman]], Jack L. Knetsch and [[Richard Thaler]] showed that measures of WTA greatly exceed measures of WTP.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kahneman, Jack L. Knetsch, Richard H. Thaler, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2937761 "Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem"], ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 98, No. 6 (Dec., 1990), pp.&amp;nbsp;1325–1348&lt;/ref&gt;  Another well-known example was documented by [[Ziv Carmon]] and [[Dan Ariely]], who found that willingness to accept for tickets to a major basketball game was more than 10 times larger than the willingness to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Ziv Carmon, Dan Ariely, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/1831177?sid=21104920591001&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3738240 Focusing on the Forgone: Why Value can Appear so Different to Buyers &amp; Sellers"], ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;360–370&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that the [[endowment effect]] makes people value a good or service more if they possess it.

However, Plott and Zeiler&lt;ref&gt;Plott, Charles R. and Kathryn Zeiler. 2005. "The Willingness to Pay–Willingness to Accept Gap, the “Endowment Effect,” Subject Misconceptions, and Experimental Procedures for Eliciting Valuations." ''The American Economic Review'', 95(3), 530-45.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that "...observed gaps [between WTA and WTP] are symptomatic of subjects' misconceptions about the nature of the experimental task" and that "the differences reported in the literature reflect differences in experimental controls for misconceptions as opposed to differences in the nature of the commodity."

==Applications==

WTP and WTA are important factors for public policy.  Many economic decisions are based upon the implicit assignment of property rights.  When looking at a lake which is being polluted by a nearby factory, the WTA and WTP for treatment of an effluent treatment plant may have different consequences based upon how property rights are politically assigned.  If lakeside residents have no property right to an effluent-free lake, then their willingness to pay to treat the lake's water supply would be considered.  Conversely, if the lakeside residents are found to have a property right to a clean lake, then their willingness to accept compensation for a polluted lake would be considered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3392">A '''work card''' is like an [[Identity Card]] which verifies that a person has been given work, or is eligible to perform work in a given profession or jurisdiction. The work card is not a [[Visa (document)|work visa]], although it may be used in conjunction with a work visa, [[United States Permanent Resident Card|permanent resident card]] or other documentation.

Work cards are often used in countries with high [[unemployment]] to certify that the individual meets certain legal requirements (such as head of household, or with dependent children) making him or her eligible for work.

Work cards are also used in certain industries like [[construction]] (where specialized training and safety skills are required)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Ontario Ministry of Labour | title = Workers Performing Specialized Construction Work | date = August 2006 | url = http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/about/ontque/fs_specialized.html | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gambling]] (where background and credit checks are required to reduce the incidence of crime).&lt;ref&gt;"ACLU Still Critical of State's Work Card Proposal," ''Gambling Magazine,'' September 10, 2002; "County Rethinks Work Card Requirements," ''Gambling Magazine,'' April 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are used in some employment situations, such as [[prostitution]], so that government officials may track the number of workers in a given industry. Frequent renewal of work cards may also be required to ensure that workers undergo regular health check-ups, or to gather information on working conditions or the incident of crime (such as assault against the prostitute, or a prostitute's criminal background).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.elko.nv.us/codes/City_Municipal_Code/Title_4/9/13.html "Section 4-9-13: Work Permit Registration Requirements." Municipal Code, City of Elko, Nevada.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are increasingly used in the [[European Union]] (EU) to verify an individual's citizenship in a member-nation, and the kind of work which that individual may engage in. For example, citizens of states with provisional membership in the EU must obtain both an EU work card and a work card from nation in which they wish to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Westmoreland Gazette | title = Employees Need a Work Card Permit | date = 2007-01-19 | url = http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/search/1134882.Employees_need_a_work_card_permit/ | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where a union has won the [[closed shop]], a work card may be issued by a [[trade union]].  The work card will permit the non-union worker to work in the industry or for the employer with union permission.&lt;ref&gt;Lahane, "The Union Work Permit," ''Political Science Quarterly,'' September 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;
