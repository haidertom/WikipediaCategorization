Rovio is investigating ways to expand the ''Angry Birds'' brand, including merchandise, television shows and movies.

=== Education ===
Rovio also launched the Angry Birds Playground in partnership with [[University of Helsinki]]. Based on the Finnish national curriculum the program covers maths, science, music, language, arts &amp; crafts, physical education and social interaction. Focused on preschoolers of kindergarten age, the program introduced interactive learning material including books, posters, games and digital content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/16/angry-birds-playground-education-rovio|title=Angry Birds Playground: Rovio catapults gaming into the classroom|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=16 September 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a spin-off from the Rovio Angry Birds Playground was established as [https://funacademy.fi/ Fun Academy] by co-founder and CEO Sanna Lukander, former Rovio's vice president of learning and book publishing, and co-founder [[:fi:Peter_Vesterbacka|Peter Vesterbacka]], former Rovio's ‘Mighty Eagle’. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160128005521/en/Rovio-Entertainment-Rovio-Spins-Education-Business-Create|title=Rovio Entertainment: Rovio Spins off Education Business to Create Fun Academy|last=|first=|date=28 January 2016|website=Business Wire|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fun Academy is currently present in 9 countries across the world.

== Controversy ==
=== Leaking user data ===
In January 2014, it was revealed that ''Angry Birds'' was considered a "leaky app" and was used to collect data about its users including their sexual orientation and location by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]. In retaliation, anti-NSA hackers defaced Rovio's Web site. Claims were made by [[Edward Snowden]] that the app was ''leaky'' and that they were capable of [[siphon]]ing data.&lt;ref name="crashingdown"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2548134/Angry-Birds-come-crashing-Maker-Rovios-site-hacked-NSA-spy-scandal-revealed-leaky-app-used-gather-data-users.html |title=Angry Birds come crashing down: Rovio's site hacked after NSA spy scandal revealed it was a 'leaky app' used to gather data on users |date=29 January 2014 |work= [[Daily Mail]]|access-date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Register]]'', the information was leaked through the in-game advertisement code like that embedded by [[One by AOL|Millennial Media]]: "Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single, married, divorced, engaged or 'swinger'. This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively, and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/01/27/leaking_smartphone_apps_nsa_gchq/|title=Fancy a little kinky sex?

Following this revelation, on 29 January, the Angry Birds site was defaced by hackers who replaced it with "Spying Birds" via a [[DNS hijacking]] attack. According to Rovio, "The defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately".&lt;ref name="spybirds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2092560/hackers-deface-angry-birds-website-following-nsa-spying-claims.html|title=Hackers transform Angry Birds website into 'Spying Birds' following NSA claims|author=Lucian Constantin|date=29 January 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syrian Electronic Army]] tweeted after the incident that the attack had been carried out by "a friend" of theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2430080,00.asp|title=Angry Birds Website Defaced After NSA Spying Allegations|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''atmospheric theatre''' is a type of [[movie palace]] design which was popular in the late 1920s. "Rather than seating the theatre patrons in a boxlike, formal setting as passive observers of stage entertainment, the atmospheric design transported them to an exotic European courtyard or garden. A cerulean sky, often intricately dotted with accurately depicted starry skies with wispy floating clouds produced by a projector replaced the ornate domes of traditional theatre design. Rather than crystal chandeliers and gilt ornamentation there were arches, trellises, balconies and statuary to evoke a sense of the outdoors. Other ornamentation included trees, palms and vines and even taxidermy birds. As the stars twinkled above, creating in the audience a sense of infinite space, when the entertainment was about to begin the lighting effects created an illusion of the setting sun, as colors changed from yellow to red to mauve. The atmospheric theatre design made the patron an active, comfortable resident of an imaginary time and place, not a passive, aloof occupant of an oppressive formal space."&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Scott L. ''A Theatre History of Marion, Ohio: John Eberson's Palace and Beyond.'' Charlotte, NC: The History Press. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extravagantly designed theaters of the early twentieth century were expensive to build. These classically designed theaters required an elaborate auditorium ceiling, usually with one or more grand chandeliers. An atmospheric theater only required a simple, smooth dome with low-wattage lights to simulate twinkling stars. This is not to say atmospheric theaters were always simple in design. The side walls of the theaters often featured very complex elements that created a fantasy outdoor setting like being in a village, garden, or on the grounds of a grand palace.

The most successful promoter of the style was [[John Eberson]]. He credited the Hoblitzelle Majestic Theatre (Houston, 1923) as the first.&lt;ref&gt;Eberson, John. "New Theatres for Old." Motion Picture News, December 30, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of the 1920s he designed around 100 atmospheric theatres in the U.S. and a few other countries, personally selecting the furnishings and art objects.

==Atmospheric theatres in the United States==
===Designed by John Eberson===
[[John Eberson]] was the most successful promoter and designer of the atmospheric style. Sixteen of his atmospheric theatres in the United States are still in operation:

*'''[[New Regal Theater]] (originally Avalon Theater)''' ([[Chicago]])
Moorish Revival

*'''[[Akron Civic Theatre]]''' ([[Akron, Ohio]])
The theater was built in 1929 by [[Marcus Loew]] and designed by theater architect [[John Eberson]]. It opened as '''Loew's (Akron) Theatre''' and seats 5,000 people. The auditorium is designed to resemble a night in a [[Moors|Moorish]] garden. Twinkling stars and drifting clouds travel across the domed ceiling. Located on Akron’s South Main Street, the theater’s entrance lobby extends over the Ohio and Erie Canal. The theater has a small multicolored terra cotta façade dominated by a large marquee. The interior of the entrance and lobby is designed to resemble a [[Moors|Moorish]] castle with Mediterranean decor, complete with medieval style carvings, authentic European antiques and Italian alabaster sculptures. A grand full-sized Wurlitzer organ hidden beneath the stage rises to the stage level on a special elevator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akroncivic.com/pages/info/history.html Akron Civic Theatre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222144655/http://akroncivic.com/pages/info/history.html |date=December 22, 2008 }} (official theater website)&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the Akron Civic Theatre closed its doors for the most expensive and extensive renovation in its history in order to bringing the theater up to modern performance and patron standards, and to restoring its failing 75-year-old infrastructure. The renovation cost just over $19 million, which included additional restroom facilities, new concession stands and expansion of the lobbies. The renovation allowed for the Civic to better serve customers with special needs by adding more handicapped seating and a new elevator. To bring the theatre up to new standards the dressing rooms were all redone and the stage was expanded from twenty-six feet to forty feet. Also added to the Civic was a freight elevator, a new loading dock and a cross-over space behind the stage's back wall.&lt;ref name=Renovation&gt;"Capital Campaign" The Civic. Web. n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Other improvements included updating the sound system, HVAC, roof exterior, electrical service and modernizing the plumbing.&lt;ref name=Renovation/&gt; The newly renovated Civic Theate re-opened in November 2002.

*'''[[Indiana Theatre (Terre Haute, Indiana)|Indiana Theatre]]''' ([[Terre Haute, Indiana]])
The Indiana Theatre has a Spanish courtyard design and was one of the first Eberson theatres to exhibit atmospheric elements. While not fully atmospheric, the Indiana Theatre's original lighting system gave a blue hue to the auditorium ceiling and scattered light to simulate stars. The tile and terrazzo flooring, shapes of windows, prominence of Spanish coats of arms, Churrigueresque exterior, as well as numerous plaster designs that were seen first in the Indiana Theatre became a framework for later designs. Eberson stated, "Into this Indiana Theatre I have put my very best efforts and endeavors in the art of designing a modern theatre such as I have often pictured as what I would do were I given a free hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indiana Theatre: An Achievement|date=1922|publisher=William R. Simmons|location=Terre Haute, IN|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Majestic Theatre (Dallas, Texas)]]''' 
Renaissance Revival. The Majestic Theatre, constructed in 1920, was the first Eberson theatre to use a simulated outdoor sky ceiling.

*'''[[Palace Theatre (Marion, Ohio)]]'''
A [[John Eberson]]-designed theater, the [[Palace Theatre (Marion, Ohio)]] was built in 1928 and renovated in 1976.  With a Spanish Revival courtyard design, the theatre features low voltage lighting in the ceiling to mimic stars and the original reconditioned cloud machine to simulate moving clouds.  Alcoves in the theatre contain stuffed birds, including a macaw that Eberson sometimes included in his interior design work, and most of the original [[Pietro Caproni]] statues.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Scott L. ''A Theatre History of Marion, Ohio: John Eberson's Palace and Beyond''. Charlotte, NC: The History Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish courtyard

* '''[[Tampa Theatre]]''' ([[Tampa, Florida]]). 
The Tampa Theatre was built in 1926. Designed by [[John Eberson]], the Tampa is a superior example of the atmospheric style featuring an auditorium that resembles a Mediterranean courtyard under a nighttime sky. Featured on the theater's opening night was the silent film ''[[The Ace of Cads]]'' starring Adolph Menjou.

* '''[[Uptown Theater (Kansas City, Missouri)]]'''.
This John Eberson-designed Italian Renaissance atmospheric theater opened in 1928 and features an outdoor Mediterranean courtyard motif. It was built to seat 2,300, but the current configuration allows for 1,700.

===Designed by other architects===
Other architects also designed atmospheric theatres. These include the following:

* '''7th Street Theatre''' ([[Hoquiam]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]).
The [[7th Street Theatre]] was built in 1928, seats over 950 people, and features an outdoor Spanish garden motif.

* '''Coronado Theatre''' ([[Rockford, Illinois]])
The [[Coronado Theatre]] was built in 1927 to a design by Frederic J. Klein, at a cost of $1.5 million. The auditorium is designed as a courtyard with Spanish and Italianate facades, painted clouds, and electric 'stars', with Japanese dragons and lanterns decorating the screens of the [[Barton organ]]. It was built to present both films and live entertainment, with a fully equipped stage and orchestra pit. Donated to the City of Rockford, it was restored 1998-2001, and primarily features live stage shows and music concerts.

* '''Fox Theatre''' ([[Atlanta, Georgia]])
The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]] was built in 1929 and is the city's only surviving movie palace. The original architecture and décor can be roughly divided into two architectural styles: Islamic architecture (building exterior, auditorium, Grand Salon, mezzanine Gentlemen’s Lounge and lower Ladies Lounge) and Egyptian architecture (Egyptian Ballroom, mezzanine Ladies Lounge and lower Gentlemen’s Lounge). The 4,678-seat auditorium replicates an Arabian courtyard complete with a night sky of 96 embedded crystal "stars" (a third of which flicker) and a projection of clouds that slowly drift across the "sky."

* '''Fox Theatre''' ([[Visalia, California]])
The [[Fox Theatre (Visalia, California)|Fox Theatre]] was built 1929-30. It was designed to evoke the garden of a South Asian temple.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxvisalia.org/files/2012/01/History.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gateway Theatre''' ([[Chicago, Illinois]])
The [[Gateway Theatre (Chicago)|Gateway Theatre]] was built in Chicago's [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]] neighborhood, the Gateway Theatre is an atmospheric theater designed by architect Mason Rapp of the prestigious firm of [[Rapp &amp; Rapp]] in 1930. It was the city's first movie theater built exclusively for the [[talkies]].

* '''Midwest Theatre''' ([[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]])

* '''Paradise Center for the Arts''' ([[Faribault, Minnesota]]).
The [[Paradise Center for the Arts]] was Built in 1929 on the site of the former Faribault Opera House, the Paradise was recently renovated. The motif is one of a [[Moors|Moorish]] courtyard with Turkish caps over the doors, turrets and 'stonework' walls. Originally built to seat 915, the Paradise has been altered to seat 300.

* '''The Polk Theatre''' ([[Lakeland, Florida]])
The [[Polk Theatre (Lakeland, Florida)]] was built in 1928 and designed by architect, James E. Casale and was built to simulate a Mediterranean village.

*'''Saenger Theatre''' (New Orleans, Louisiana)
The [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans, Louisiana)]] was built in 1927 for the Saenger Theatres chain by architect [[Emile Weil]], Its interior evokes a baroque Florentine courtyard.  Originally seating approximately 4,000, in 1980 its seating was reduced to approximately 2,736 and it began to function as a [[performing arts center]] with occasional film screenings.

*'''Keith-Albee Theatre''' (Huntington, West Virginia)
The [[Keith-Albee Theatre]] was opened to the public in 1928 as part of the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] circuit, the premier vaudeville tour on the East Coast of the United States. Later on in its life, it showed movies and is now a [[performing arts center]] with occasional film screenings.

*'''Orpheum Theatre''' (Phoenix, Arizona)
The [[Orpheum Theatre (Phoenix, Arizona)|Orpheum]] opened in 1929, and was used for vaudeville, movies, and as a touring Broadway theater. After falling into disrepair for some years, the Orpheum Theatre was purchased in 1984 by the city of Phoenix, which then began a 12-year, $14 million restoration. The [[Conrad Schmitt Studios]] created the transformation and the Orpheum reopened on January 28, 1997, with a performance of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' starring [[Carol Channing]]. After the performance, Ms. Channing, still in costume but out of character, thanked the audience for "not turning this beautiful theatre into a parking lot!"

*'''Arlington Theater''' (Santa Barbara, California)
The [[Arlington Theater]] was built in 1931 on the former site of the Arlington Hotel, which was destroyed following the 1925 earthquake. The current structure was erected in 1930 as a showcase movie house for [[Fox West Coast Theaters]]. It was restored and expanded in the mid-1970s by Metropolitan Theaters Corporation. It opened in its current incarnation in 1976.
* '''[[Paramount Theater (Austin, Minnesota)|Paramount Theatre]]''' ([[Austin, Minnesota]])
Built in 1929 by Wagner Construction; designed by the firm of Ellerbe &amp; Company, the [[Paramount Theater (Austin, Minnesota)|Paramount Theatre]] opened under the [[Publix Theaters|Publix]] banner on September 14, 1929 with a parade. Interior atmospheric design elements depict a quaint Spanish villa under the stars with [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]] exterior architecture. Now owned and operated by the [http://www.austinareaarts.org/ Austin Area Commission for the Arts], an independent non profit, the theatre presents a full [http://www.austinareaarts.org/events/?view=calendar&amp;month=March-2018 calendar] of movies and performing arts.

*'''Redford Theatre''' (Detroit, Michigan)
The [[Redford Theatre]] was built in 1927 as a silent film theatre and showed its first film in January 1928.  At present, it has 1610 seats and has a Japanese tea garden design.  The stars in the sky have been upgraded to use fiber optics.  The Redford theatre was purchased by the current owner, The Motor City Theatre Organ Society in the mid-1970's and now shows classic films, and hosts occasional stage events including rentals.  The theatre has a fully equipped stage with dressing rooms, and when it first opened was also intended to have vaudeville performances. The theatre's mission is to preserve the history of the film arts.  Silent films are still occasionally shown and when they are, they are accompanied by the theatre's 1928 Barton Theatre Organ which also has been restored and it is played prior to every film that is shown.

==Atmospheric theatres outside of the United States==
[[File:The Wee Picture House, Campbeltown, Kintyre - geograph.org.uk - 53117.jpg|thumb|The [[Campbeltown Picture House]] is the only extant atmospheric theatre in Scotland.]]
The following are atmospheric theatres located outside of the United States:

*'''Auckland Civic Theatre''' ([[Auckland]], New Zealand).
The [[Auckland Civic Theatre]] is the largest surviving atmospheric cinema in [[Australasia]], built in 1929 and featuring an India-inspired motif. Seating 2,750 viewers, in 2000 it was restored to near-original condition.&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{NZHPT|100|Civic Theatre Building|2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Jackson]] used the Civic in his remake of the film [[King Kong]].

*'''Columbia Theatre''' ([[New Westminster]], British Columbia, Canada).
The [[Columbia Theatre (New Westminster, British Columbia)|Columbia Theatre]] is the oldest surviving atmospheric cinema in [[British Columbia]], built in 1927 and featuring moorish design lattice work, with Spanish garden murals and wrote irons. Originally built with over 900 seats, the theatre was divided into two levels and was most recently renovated as cabaret style theatre.  Lafflines Comedy Club and Amicus Performing Arts Club operate this heritage theatre.

*'''[[Capitol Theatre (Port Hope)|Capitol Theatre]]''' ([[Port Hope, Ontario]], Canada)
The Capitol Theatre is located in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada, and is one of the last three atmospheric movie theatres still in operation in Canada. Constructed in 1930, the interior of the auditorium was designed to resemble a walled medieval courtyard surrounded by a forest. It was also one of the first cinemas in Canada built expressly for talking pictures. It opened on Friday, August 15, 1930 with the film "Queen High" starring Charles Ruggles and Ginger Rogers.

*'''Le Grand Rex''' ([[Paris]], France)
[[Le Grand Rex]] is the largest cinema, theater and music venue in Paris, with 2,800 seats. Opened in 1932, the cinema features a starred "sky" overhead, as well as interior fountains, and resembles a Mediterranean courtyard at night. The cinema features one of the largest screen in Europe. [[John Eberson]] assisted architect Auguste Bluysen with the project by putting input in.

* '''[[Lido Theatre (Canada)|Lido Theatre]]''' ([[The Pas]], [[Manitoba]], Canada).
The Lido Theatre was built in 1929 and designed by Max Blankstein. The Lido is the world's longest continuously operating atmospheric theatre (87 years straight as of 2016). The interior features an outdoor Mediterranean courtyard motif. It was built to seat 600 people but the current configuration allows for 350. The Lido has avoided major renovations, remaining close to its original design. A rare survivor in its class, one of the few cinemas to stay in the same family for four generations, it remains owned by the Rivalin family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lidotheatre.ca/ Lido Theatre] (official theater website)&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Rialto Cinema''' ([[Dunedin]], New Zealand).
The [[Rialto Cinema, Dunedin|Rialto Cinema]] originally seated 2,000. The cinema has been converted into a six-theater multiplex. Renovations in 1998 restored its Moorish-themed features and night sky.

*'''[[Roxy Theatre (Saskatoon)|Roxy Theatre]]''' ([[Saskatoon]], Canada).
*'''Cineteca Alameda''' ([[San Luis Potosí City]], Mexico).
Located in the city center. The Cineteca Alameda was opened on 27 February 1941 with Marlene Dietrich in "Seven Sinners". Seating was originally provided for over 1,000 in orchestra and balcony levels. In recent years it was used for concerts, film festivals and for screening classic movies, it seems to have closed in 2012, but had reopened by 2014 offering a mix of art house movies and live performances. It seem only the orchestra seating area is currently being used.

*'''Palacio Chino''' ([[Mexico City]], Mexico)
The fancy Palacio Chino opened in March 29, 1940. It used the shell of a former ball court, whose space was sufficient for a big movie theatre. It was the only one built ever in Mexico in Chinese style, but unlike the Grauman’s Chinese, the interior was of the atmospheric type. In 1945 it was listed as having 4,000 seats in two levels, orchestra and balcony. It featured a fairly big stage, enough so to hold a symphony orchestra, and indeed was sometimes used as a music theater. Celibidache once directed the National Symphony Orchestra here, as an alternate theater to Bellas Artes, itself the home theater of said orchestra. The inevitable comparation with Grauman’s Chinese stands only as original inspiration goes, because both buildings are very different. The Palacio Chino has a big, traditional flat facade, right in front of Iturbide street. The many windows of this facade are adorned as small pagodas, and there is a big, ornate marquee. The vestibule was spacious and full of Chinese decorations, even the ticket boots were rendered as pagodas. The auditorium was of the atmospheric type, with pagodas, temples and gold Buddha statues amid gardens. The ceiling was vault-like, not flat but very arched, and of course was painted deep blue. The screen was protected by a heavy black curtain, with Chinese motifs painted upon. The screen arch was very heavily decorated, with dragons appearing here and there.

*'''[[Campbeltown Picture House]]''' (Campbeltown, Scotland)
Purpose-built cinema constructed in 1903. It was renovated in 1935 in the atmospheric style. It is the only surviving atmospheric theatre in Scotland.

An '''audition''' is a sample performance by an [[actor]], [[singer]], [[musician]], [[dancer]] or other performer. It typically involves the performer displaying their talent through a previously memorized and rehearsed solo piece or by performing a work or piece given to the performer at the audition or shortly before. In some cases, such as with a model or acrobat, the individual may be asked to demonstrate a range of professional skills. Actors may be asked to present a [[monologue]]. Singers will perform a [[song]] in a popular music context or an [[aria]] in a Classical context. A dancer will present a routine in a specific style, such as ballet, tap dance or hip-hop, or show his or her ability to quickly learn a choreographed dance piece.

The audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals select performers, which is in some ways analogous to a [[job interview]] in the regular job market. In an audition, the employer is testing the ability of the applicant to meet the needs of the job and assess how well the individual will take directions and deal with changes. After some auditions, after the performer has demonstrated their abilities in a given performance style, the audition panel may ask a few questions that resemble those used in standard job interviews (e.g., regarding availability).

Auditions are required for many reasons in the performing arts world. Often, employing companies or groups use auditions to select performers for upcoming shows or productions. An audition for a performing opportunity may be for a single performance (e.g., doing a monologue at a comedy club), for a series or season of performances (a season of a Broadway play), or for [[permanent employment]] with the performing organization (e.g., an orchestra or dance troupe). Auditions for performing opportunities may be for amateur, school, or community organizations, in which case the performers will typically not be paid. As well, auditions are used to select or screen candidates for entry to training programs (ballet school or circus school); university programs ([[B.Mus]], [[M.Mus]], [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Theater); performance-related scholarships and grants; or to be considered for representation by a talent agency or individual agent.

==Actors==
[[File:Владимир Назаров.jpg|thumb|For actors, monologues and speeches are the "calling card" that they use to demonstrate their skills to casting directors.]]

For actors in theater, film, and TV, the "audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals make final casting decisions.  Industry professionals may consist of casting directors, producers, directors or agency representatives".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auditionmonologues.com/Audition%20Tips.html|title=Audition Tips Monologues Actors Kids Teens Women Men|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In film and television, the audition is called a [[screen test]], and it is filmed so that the casting director or director can see how the actor appears on screen. Auditions are advertised in major media outlets (such as newspaper or radio), industry magazines and newsletters (e.g., auditions for musicians are advertised in the American Federation of Musicians newsletter), audition websites, and through a talent/casting agencies. Some performers hire an agent, to be able to draw on the agent's connections with casting directors and performing arts companies. However, the agent will take a cut (often 10–20%) of the performer's earnings. Although an actor's talents comprise crucial criteria in the casting process, an almost equal amount of attention is given to an actor's "type", (a combination of personality, looks and general casting intuition) as required for a particular production.

Actors who are selecting an audition piece may select a monologue by a character who is close to their own age. They may wear neutral clothing that allows freedom of movement. Auditionees may avoid going over the stated time limit. By convention, some actors choose to not direct their speech to the audition panel if they are doing an on-stage audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716210917/http://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the audition panel may request that the auditionee interacts with them (e.g., a director may ask the actor to speak the lines while looking directly at the director). An actor who is doing an audition may warm up before the audition, like an athlete would, although with an actor, a warm up might include vocal exercises in addition to stretching. Just as with any interview outside of the performing arts world, an auditionee may dress well. Even if the auditionee does not have expensive clothing, simple clothing may be acceptable if it is clean and of good quality. Auditionees know casting directors are also considering "whether or not the actor will be easy to work with, that they know what they are doing and can take direction well".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"/&gt;

Audition pieces are not always from the show the actor is being considered for; an actor wishing to be cast in ''[[Hamlet]]'' may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do have a range of audition pieces and select something appropriate; an actor auditioning for ''Hamlet'' would have a dramatic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an [[Oscar Wilde]] [[comedy]], or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).

For most auditions, it is expected that auditionees will bring a professional 8"x10" photo called a "head shot" and a resume that indicates their acting experience and training. Actors may bring additional copies of the head shot and resume, in case there are additional members of the casting team present at the audition. The casting agent or company may "call back" an auditionee days, weeks, or even months after the initial audition for a second audition. At a major audition for a professional company, the time limits are strictly enforced. A musical theater performer may be given a moment to tell the piano accompanist the tempo, and state their name and audition number to the audition panel. Then, once the auditionee starts acting or singing, the clock starts running. A buzzer sounds when the time limit runs out, which may be a minute and a half, two minutes, or three minutes, depending on the company. At this point, the auditionee is expected to stop and leave to free up the stage for the next auditionee.

Right before the audition, the casting director may give new instructions that were not in the advertisement; for example, due to time constraints, the time limit for the monologues might be cut in half, or the vocal selections might be cut. Actors know that it is important that they follow these last-minute instructions, and not be "thrown off balance" by these changes. At an audition, a director may ask for changes in the delivery of the lines or in other aspects of the performance. The goal may be to see if the auditionee is versatile or because the director disagrees with the initial approach used by the auditionee. In either case, the behavior of the auditionee is important; if the auditionee is cooperative in making the changes, it shows that he or she will be easy to work with. If a script is provided beforehand, actors often try to memorize as much as possible, because this shows that they have prepared and it allows them to look up from the script and show their facial expressions more.

Film auditions are different from theatre auditions. For film auditions, actors and actresses are given "sides" which are often a few pages of the script with the roles that they are auditioning for. These sides are often given to the actors 1–3 days before the audition.

In 2015, the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive video cameras has made video recordings of auditions feasible. To find their talent, casting directors are able to request video auditions from actors and actresses from a different state or country.

==Music==

===Popular music===

====Instrumentalists====
[[File:Wolfgang Schmid Unterfahrt-OhWeh-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play basslines from a range of different styles.]]
In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, instrumentalists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music at various levels of difficulty. In jazz groups, auditionees may be asked to perform standard pieces (e.g., a [[jazz standard]] such as "Now's the Time") with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play a rock or blues standard. An auditionee for a [[rhythm section]] role (rhythm guitar, electric bass, drumkit, etc.) will be asked to play a range of standard styles or "feels" which are used in a given style. For example, a drummer applying to play in a jazz band might be asked to play a slow [[ballad]], a medium "standard", and an up-tempo swing style. A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play in a [[Motown]] style [[bassline]], a syncopated 1970s [[funk]] "slapping" style line, and a [[reggae]]-style bassline. A person auditioning for a role as a rhythm section member in some styles of music may be expected to be able to demonstrate the ability to perform as a backup singer.

A performer auditioning for a solo or "lead" instrument role will typically perform prepared solos that showcase a range of skills, including the ability to perform a melody with sensitivity and expression; the ability to play virtuosic passages; and, in some styles (e.g., fusion jazz or blues), the ability to [[improvise]] a melody over a chord progression. In some popular genres, there is relatively less emphasis on "stage presence" and movement onstage, such as classic [[jazz]] or traditional 1950s-style country music. In these styles, there is more of a focus on the sound of the music and the expressiveness of the performer with their voice or instrument. In other genres, such as heavy metal "[[shred guitar]]" or [[hardcore punk]], it may be very important that a performer can move about in a dramatic fashion onstage. One of the differences between instrumentalist auditions in rock music styles and Classical styles is that in a rock context, the performers will be expected to have memorized most or all of the music. In a Classical context, most or all of the music is read from sheet music (with the exception of a solo Bach suite movement or a solo concerto movement).

====Singers====
[[File:Irving Berlin Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irving Berlin]], [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], and [[Helen Tamiris]] watching music theater auditions]]
For rock, country, and other forms of popular music, auditions are used to test the ability of an instrumentalist or singer to perform a specific style of music, or several styles. A singer auditioning for a role in a [[musical theatre]] production would not, unless instructed otherwise, need to sing [[opera]] or [[country music]], and a musician auditioning for a seat in an [[orchestra]] would not perform [[rock (music)|rock]].  Occasionally a musical theatre audition may require the performer to sing a song in the [[music genre|genre]] to which the musical pertains.  For instance, a singer auditioning for ''[[Destry Rides Again (musical)|Destry Rides Again]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[country-western]] song. A person auditioning for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[rock music|rock]] song.  As well, in some cases, an audition may require a performer to demonstrate pieces in several styles. A hard rock band auditioning a new singer may request that the individual perform songs from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and related styles such as [[blues rock]]. A pop or rock band that is selecting a new lead singer that has whittled the number of applicants down to the top two or three singers may test out how the singers perform in live shows by performing a few live concerts with each guest singer. This allows the band to see how the singer performs in a full multi-hour concert, including how well the singer can develop a rapport with the audience, deal with the inevitable problems that occur in live music (e.g., microphones failing or stage lights malfunctioning), and maintain their vocal endurance until the end of the evening.

[[File:ESC 2007 Denmark - DQ - Drama Queen.jpg|thumb|A contestant in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] tries to impress the judges at her live audition]]
For smaller roles in a large musical theater production, mass auditions are held at which many inexperienced or aspiring performers, most without [[talent agent|agents]], show up. These are popularly known as "cattle calls", since the hopefuls are often kept together in one large room. The musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' depicts this type of audition. ''[[American Idol]]'' also auditions its aspiring [[vocalists]] using this technique, since there are so many auditions. In musical theater and in pop music styles for which onstage dancing is part of the performance (e.g., hip hop), singers who are doing a vocal audition may also be required to demonstrate that they can dance while singing. In some popular music groups, such as a rock band, a [[backup singer]] may be expected to be able to play an instrument while singing, such as strumming a simple [[rhythm guitar]] part or playing a percussion instrument (e.g., tambourine or congas). While an ability to sing in multiple languages with the appropriate diction and pronunciation is more associated with Classical music than popular music, there are some popular styles where multiple languages are expected, including Latin jazz styles such as [[Bossa Nova]] (Portuguese songs may be requested); Tango (Spanish songs may be requested); folk music (French songs may be requested); and [[Celtic music]] (Irish songs may be requested).

===Classical music===
In classical music, auditions are used to screen candidates for positions as instrumentalists in chamber groups or orchestras or as soloists, and to screen singers for positions as members of a choir or as solo performers. In classical music, auditions are also used to screen candidates for entry to training programs, university or Conservatory programs or degrees, and training festival activities (e.g., classical summer camps). In comparison with some types of pop music auditions, classical auditions tend to be much more formal. The performer may, by tradition, wear a tuxedo or a formal dress, and the judges may sit behind a desk and write comments on clipboards.

====Instrumentalists====

In classical music, each instrument or vocal type has a standard repertoire of music which is commonly requested at auditions. Instrumentalists in an orchestral context are typically asked to perform excerpts from the orchestral literature, including both exposed solos and "tutti" parts which are particularly demanding. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], and a number of Principal players from the orchestra. Since the post-WW II era, professional orchestra auditions often include a musician's union representative, who ensures that the audition is being run in a fair manner. In many major orchestras, a cloth screen may be used at some stages of the audition process, to protect the audition panel from allegations of favouritism or sexism.

An orchestral audition will normally set out a list of orchestral excerpts which each performer has to prepare. As well, each performer plays a movement from a Sonata or Concerto which may be performed with piano accompaniment. When the performer plays the orchestral excerpts, he or she may be given a tempo, or asked to follow the gestures of the conductor. Orchestral auditions are often run in several stages, in order to screen candidates and reduce those who are less likely to meet the needs of the job. A large number of applicants typically apply for a professional orchestra job. The orchestra personnel manager then selects the most promising candidates based on the experience and training indicated in the applicants' CVs (and, in some cases, based on the performing ability demonstrated in a recording of the applicant).

This first "cut" of auditionees then perform in front of the audition panel. Typically in a professional orchestra, this would require the performance of excerpts representing stylistic and technical challenges drawn from repertoire typical to that orchestra. The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music.

If a candidate is successful in passing the audition, typically a Trial period of several months to a year takes place allowing the Chief Conductor and Principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

====Singers====
There is a standard repertoire of vocal literature for each voice type (e.g., soprano, alto) that is used at auditions for singers. Each sub-type of vocal activity has a separate standard audition repertoire (e.g., choirs, operas, etc.). A person auditioning for a role in a choir will be expected to be able to sight read choral parts. In auditions for opera, a singer will be expected to demonstrate the ability to act out the movements that are associated with the lyrics of the aria, which may include pretending to be dying from a stab wound, miming an activity (e.g., pouring wine), or doing a simple dance routine. Both choral and opera singers are expected to be able to follow the gestures of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] in regards to expression and tempo. Since microphones are not used in most classical music performances,&lt;ref&gt;The exception is [[acoustic enhancement]] systems which apply a subtle amplification in order to balance the volume in the hall and compensate for acoustic problems.&lt;/ref&gt; the audition panel will be assessing the auditionees ability to project a strong, room-filling vocal tone. In classical music, in addition to judging singing ability (e.g., tone, intonation, etc.), the audition panel will be judging the applicant's ability to use the appropriate diction and pronunciation of the major languages used in Art music: German, Italian, and French. Other languages that the applicant may be asked to sing in include English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin.

==Musical theatre==
In [[musical theatre]], a standard audition consists of two sixteen-measure selections of [[song]]s, contrasting in style, intention, characters, time period, or all of the above. There is also usually a monologue portion, where the actor is asked to perform a one-minute [[monologue]]. A headshot and résumé are almost always required. Although auditions vary depending on the theatre, program, or show, this formula is considered “the norm” in the musical theatre world. The purpose of an audition is two-fold. Practically, performers audition to get a callback. "Callbacks", or callback auditions, allow the artistic team to assess a performer’s skills in accordance with specific characters. During the callback, the panel has shortlisted a candidate, because they have noted his or her potential for particular parts. As such, during a callback audition, the candidate is asked to sing the songs performed by certain characters or read their lines. The first audition is not a platform for selling oneself as a particular character. Character-specific auditions take place during callbacks. Instead, the first audition is a chance for the performer to show off the songs she does best.

==Dance==
[[File:Two dancers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two dancers performing [[modern dance]], a style in which performers may be asked to demonstrate improvised movements at an audition.]]
There are many types of dance auditions for different performance venues. Dance companies hire employees for ballet and modern dance shows. Broadway companies hire dancers for traditional musicals (Rodgers and Hammerstein) and more modern dance musicals (e.g., ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''). Casinos, resorts, amusement parks, and cruise ships hire dancers for revue-style shows that can range from jazz dance to hip-hop. For these shows, some backup singing skills or acting skills may be required. Pop music concert producers and pop music video producers recruit dancers to perform onstage during concerts or during videos. For live pop concerts, onstage dancers may be required to perform simple backup singing. Movie and TV producers also hire dancers for short term shoots; even though a dancer may only get several days of work from a movie or TV show, there may be residual payments. Most auditions specify what type of dance skills are required (e.g., Classical, pointe, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, etc.). In the case of modern dance, some dance companies ask applicants to demonstrate their ability to improvise dance moves.
[[File:Brazier Dancers 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|These dancers from the Braziers troupe are performing [[Highland dancing]], a style at which auditionees must demonstrate a high degree of technique and the ability to quickly learn new steps.]]
Many dance auditions test the ability of applicants to learning new [[choreography]] in a short time period, rather than showcasing a prepared work. In other cases, a short prepared solo piece may also be required (about 90 seconds long). Applicants will be instructed in a technical routine or pattern in a group session. Some auditions require applicants to have completed training at a recognised dance school or conservatoire, and in some cases, auditionees may be requested to bring a reference letter from a dance teacher or dance company director (especially in the case of young dancers with little professional experience). At some auditions, applicants are asked to make a short verbal statement about their dancing goals or why they wish to join the troupe. Auditionees should ensure that they know the major dance terms, because the judges may request that certain dance moves be demonstrated.

Dancers are often asked to bring one or two photographs, such as a "headshot" and a full-body photo of the applicant in a dancing pose. The clothing that auditionees need to wear at auditions varies. At some auditions, particularly Classical auditions, there is a strict dress code: applicants wear dance leotards and [[pointe shoes]], and long hair is tied back. Other dance auditions specify loose clothing. For some contemporary dance auditions, applicants must dance barefoot. In some music theater roles, applicants need to bring tap shoes to demonstrate their [[tap dancing]] skills. Some auditions where there is a large number of applicants require the performers to wear a number pinned to their shirt, in a similar way to marathon runners. This way, if the casting director sees an exceptional dancer, he or she can take note of the number. Unless jewellery or make-up is an expected part of a dancer's appearance in a certain dance style, dance auditionees generally avoid jewellery and makeup.

In music theater and pop music, there is a lot of crossover between dancing and singing roles. Almost all dancers in music theater and many dancers in pop music will be expected to have some singing ability as a [[backup singer]] (singing harmony parts to accompany the solo vocalists). In rarer cases, dancers will be asked to demonstrate the ability to play a musical instrument (e.g., guitar), because there are some shows in which some of the dancer-actors have to play instruments onstage, such as the ''[[Threepenny Opera]]''. In music theater, there is also often crossover between dancing and acting roles. Dancers may be expected to be able to take on an acting role and speak lines (often in a supporting role).

Some major dance companies have "open calls" once a year, in which any or almost any applicant can come to demonstrate their dancing skills. At these open calls, the entire group of applicants are taught a dance routine by a choreographer, and then the group of dancers performs the routine while judges assess their performance. It can be hard for a good dancer to get noticed by the judges in such a large group of dancers. For this reason, some dance coaches encourage their students to wear outgoing clothes and bright things to stand out, so that the dancer will get personal attention during his or her audition. For any audition interviews, dancers should send their resume and headshot to the company director ahead of time.

==Circuses and amusement parks==
[[File:Acrobat.jpg|thumb|A [[high wire]] act by an acrobat]]

Performers auditioning for amusement parks world wide are generally viewed by one or more casting directors in a rehearsal hall or a large facility. Most theme park auditions, like other auditions, are closed to the public. This means that no one is allowed into the audition room who is not auditioning. Vocalists for Disney auditions are asked to prepare two separate vocal selections of contrasting styles. The singers do not sing the entire songs; instead they just need to sing the best 16 bars of each song. Disney provides a piano accompanist for all vocal auditions, and so singers have to bring sheet music in the correct key. Disney does not allow any pre-recorded accompaniment. The casting directors may also ask auditionees to learn additional music or learn a movement combination. Disney Parks &amp; Resorts casts performers for theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/auditions/experience/prepare.html|title=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Cirque du Soleil]], depending on a performer's discipline, the audition may last an hour, a day or even two days. Depending on a performer's  discipline, he or she might have to perform a solo presentation in front of the group of participants and/or participate in individual and group exercises following the solo presentation. Auditions for Cirque du Soleil are filmed.

==Modeling==

[[File:Ai Tominaga, Red Dress Collection 2004.jpg|thumb|Model [[Ai Tominaga]] modeling in the 2004 [[The Heart Truth|Red Dress Collection for the Heart Truth]] campaign]]

[[Fashion model|Modelling]] agencies and other organizations that are looking for models, such as fashion designers and advertising agencies also use auditions to screen and select potential candidates. Aspiring female models for most fashion industry roles need to be in their teens or early twenties and be tall and slim. Although there are "niche markets" for non-svelte models ("plus size models" and "real life models" who model clothes for middle-market clothing catalogues), most female models need to be slender and between 108–125&amp;nbsp;lbs. Young men who are aspiring models should be between 18 and 25, tall, and fit. While male models who are selected at modelling auditions may well end up having careers that last till beyond age 25 (even into their 40s), modelling agencies prefer to recruit new models in the 18–25 age range. Most models work with an agent who arranges auditions, bookings, and negotiates fees. At an audition, casting agents will ask the model to demonstrate different poses, which a photographer may record with a digital camera.

For high fashion auditions, the model may be asked to demonstrate the "catwalk" style of modelling clothes on a raised runway. At most modelling auditions, models wear fairly simple clothes that will allow the talent agents to imagine the model in different garments. Typically, a model wears fairly body-hugging clothes, so that the judges can see the body type of the model. Some modelling agencies audition a large number of aspiring models in an "open call", in which agents consider applicants for under a minute or so each. Some agencies hold model searches, which is a type of beauty contest in which applicants audition for the opportunity of winning a model portfolio or a photo shoot.

In discussion of [[science fiction]], a '''Big Dumb Object''' ('''BDO''') is any mysterious object (usually of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] or unknown origin and immense power) in a story which generates an intense [[sense of wonder]] by its mere existence; to a certain extent, the term deliberately deflates this.

The term was not in general use until [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] included it in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' as a joke in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Peter, 2000, ''Big Dumb Objects and Cosmic Enigmas: The Love Affair between Space Fiction and the Transcendental'', in Westfahl, Gary (ed), ''Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction'', Greenwood Press, p. 13. "... I decided to write an April Fool's entry. I would pretend that a phrase I’d always liked, originated by the critic Roz Kaveney but not in general use, was actually a known critical term. I would write an entry called 'Big Dumb Objects' in a poker-faced style, suggesting an even more absurd critical term to be used in its place, 'megalotropic sf.'"&lt;/ref&gt; while its creation has been attributed to reviewer [[Roz Kaveney]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaveney, Roz, 1981, ''[[Foundation - The International Review of Science Fiction|Foundation: The International Review of Science Fiction]]'', issue 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Dumb Objects often exhibit extreme or unusual properties, or a total absence of some expected properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Christopher|date=2006|title=Big Dumb Objects in Science Fiction: Sublimity, Banality, and Modernity|url=https://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/extr.2006.47.1.10?journalCode=extr|journal=Extrapolation|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=95–111|doi=10.3828/extr.2006.47.1.10|issn=0014-5483|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The monolith in Stanley Kubrick and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' is an indecipherable influence on the protohumans to whom it first appears, and later in the film serves to show how little humans have evolved.  Astronaut Bowman's attempt to interact with the monolith only makes him a part of its mystery.
*The object discovered in ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' was made of a material of extreme hardness, such that [[diamond]]-tipped drills and [[acetylene]] torches would not damage it. At the same time nothing would adhere to it.
*In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Rendezvous With Rama]]'', a 50km-long cylinder is detected entering the solar system.
*[[Charles Sheffield]]'s [[Heritage Universe]] setting features many immense alien artifacts, some of which are more inscrutable than others. 
*In the [[Sphere (1998 film)|movie]] based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Sphere (novel)|Sphere]]'', the eponymous object would reflect everything in its presence except people. If it did reflect someone, she or he was alone, and the individual was accepted as worthy to harness the device's power.
*In [[Iain Banks]]' novel ''[[Against a Dark Background]]'', the Lazy Guns have a lot of mass and yet little weight, and weigh three times as much upside-down as upright.
*The dome from the [[Stephen King]] [[Under the Dome (novel)|novel]] and [[Under the Dome (TV series)|television show]] ''Under the Dome''. The dome is large and transparent unless touched by a person; it gives a slight electric shock when touched for the first time by someone, but not afterwards. It cannot be penetrated, even by a [[MOAB]], and is seemingly causing many mysterious events in Chester's Mill, the town that the dome is enclosing, including causing all electronic devices near it to explode, visions, and, in one character, premature birth. 

Such unexpected properties are usually used to rule out conventional origins for the BDO and increase the sense of mystery, and even fear, for the characters interacting with it.

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]

*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al.

This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D.

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells, Stanley.

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.

They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

The '''Care Bears''' are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist [[Elena Kucharik]] to be used on [[greeting cards]] from [[American Greetings]], but  later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. 

The original development was through American Greetings' "Those Characters From Cleveland" [[research and development]] division, In 1983, [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] turned the Care Bears into plush [[teddy bear]]s. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called ''[[The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'' (1984). They then had a [[The Care Bears (TV series)|television series]] from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'' (1986) and ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'' (1987).

Each Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality.  The movie ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' named them "belly badges". Adding to the Care Bear family are the "Care Bear Cousins", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] movies: ''[[Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot]]'' (2004), ''[[The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie]]'' (2005) and ''The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom'' (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]''. The premiere of the series utilizes "30 years of caring". It premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, "Care Bears and Cousins", was commissioned by [[Netflix]] and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures &amp; blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. [[Jack Chojnacki]], the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: "It had a high aaaaaah factor."&lt;ref name=aaah&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rfEPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mIwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3720,590789&amp;dq=care+bears+movie&amp;hl=en |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |agency=[[New York Daily News]] |title=High 'aaah" factor has meant millions |date=April 2, 1985 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |page=4B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muriel Fahrion]], the artist who helped create [[Strawberry Shortcake]]'s look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXBZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears&amp;dq=Muriel+Fahrion+-+Care+Bears |author1=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |author2=Union française des œuvres laïques d'éducation par l'image et le son |title=La Revue du cinéma |volume=418 |chapter=Les Bisounours (The Care Bears Movie) |language=French |page=26 |year=1986 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Ligue française de l'enseignement et de l'éducation permanente |quote=Scn. : Peter Sauder, d'après les personnages créés pour Those Characters from Cleveland par Linda Edwards, Muriel Fahrion, Elena Kucharik, Dave Polter, Tom Schneider, Ralph Shaffer, Clark Willey.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator [[Elena Kucharik]] became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of [[General Mills]]).&lt;ref name=guilford&gt;{{cite book |last=Pecora |first=Norma Odom |title=The Business of Children's Entertainment |isbn=1-57230-774-9 |year=1998 |publisher=Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

As they had done with [[Strawberry Shortcake]], once titled "Project I", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development "Project II" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.&lt;ref name=cbsite&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301073233/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/funfacts.html |title=History &amp; Facts: More Care Bears Fun Facts |archivedate=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1982 launch ===
On September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts.&lt;ref name="cb-pr"&gt;{{cite press release |title=The biggest character launch in the history of retailing ... |date=September 24, 1982 |location=New York City |work=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal.&lt;ref name="cb-pr" /&gt; Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by [[Parker Brothers]] and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as "the biggest character launch in the history of retailing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB294D2283BB84A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=DeWolf |first=Rose |title=Out to launch: Is there shelf life after Holly Hobbie?

In December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as "Message Bears". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the "heart-shaped 'touché tags'" used to identify the Care Bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LVouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=udoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5386,2660829&amp;dq=care-bears&amp;hl=en |author=[[Associated Press]] (AP) |title='Care Bears' makers lose copyright suit |date=December 14, 1983 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Beaver County Times]] |page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, ''[[The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine]]'', came out that same year. A [[miniseries]] based on the toys was distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company]].&lt;ref name=guilford /&gt;{{rp|52}} A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', produced by [[Nelvana]] Limited and released by [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]]. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] market at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="nelvana-25"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Three+men+and+a+bear%3A+Nelvana+at+25-a030533629 |last1=Besen |first1=Ellen |last2=Glassman |first2=Marc |title=Three men and a bear: Nelvana at 25 |date=September 22, 1996 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021063946/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Three+men+and+a+bear:+Nelvana+at+25-a030533629 |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that autumn, [[DIC Entertainment]] released an 11-episode television series in syndication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A DIC Directory: 16 years of company's smallscreen creations |date=July 12, 1999 |work=Variety |page=A30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]''. Released by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.

Later that year, a TV series titled ''The Care Bears Family'' (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] and Canada's [[Global Television Network|Global]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new season children's shows |date=September 9, 1986 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard [[List of Care Bear characters#No Heart|No Heart]] and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece [[Shreeky]] was introduced.

The Care Bears' third film, ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', debuted in 1987. A TV special, ''[[Care Bears Nutcracker Suite]]'', premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.

Over 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70&amp;nbsp;million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2&amp;nbsp;billion during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=agsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |title=About Us: History |accessdate=February 26, 2006 |publisher=[[American Greetings]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210053021/http://corporate.americangreetings.com/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=December 10, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbhistory&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050303062052/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/history/index.html |title=History &amp; Facts |archivedate=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1991 relaunch ===
In early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DDNB&amp;p_theme=ddnb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F504F756A8A1153&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |last=Moss |first=Meredith |title=She's a living doll |date=March 3, 1991 |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[Dayton Daily News]] |publisher=Cox Ohio Publishing |page=5E |quote=Patriotic bears: Two Ohio companies have joined together to teach children about the environment and patriotism....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publishing company [[Random House]] released two tie-in books: ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' (1991) by Bobbi Katz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=[[WorldCat]] |publisher=[[Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910173629/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-big-cleanup/oclc/23583231 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503023757/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Big-Cle/dp/0679823670 |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' (1992) by Peggy Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |title=Catalog information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |work=WorldCat |publisher=Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910010416/http://www.worldcat.org/title/care-bears-and-the-whale-tale/oclc/24285982 |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641/ |title=Product information for ''The Care Bears and the Whale Tale'' |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |publisher=Amazon.com Inc |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605073157/http://www.amazon.com/Care-Bears-Whale-Tale-Picturebacks/dp/0679827641 |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2002 relaunch ===
In 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by [[Jay Foreman (businessman)|Jay Foreman]], the president of [[Fort Lauderdale]]-based [[Play Along Toys]], for less than $1&amp;nbsp;million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCall |first=Kimberly L. |title=Sell It, Baby! Practical How-Tos on Marketing, Branding &amp; Sales |page=3 |isbn=1-59113-394-7 |year=2003 |publisher=Booklocker.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.

In the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as [[Wal-Mart]], [[Kmart]], [[Toys "R" Us]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[KB Toys]], and [[Mervyns]].&lt;ref name=cbfaq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307224518/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/faq/index.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |archivedate=March 7, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new merchandise included the Bears doing [[aerobics]]; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304010508/http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |url=http://www.care-bears.com/CareBears/html/new/index.html |title=New &amp; Now |archivedate=March 4, 2005 |accessdate=May 26, 2006 |work=Care Bears Official Site |publisher=American Greetings |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70 million {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Elizabeth |title=Care Bears Receive 'Gentle' Makeover |date=February 9, 2007 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |volume=249 |number=33 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] and subsidiary [[Family Home Entertainment|FHE Pictures]], in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' in 2004 and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.

New versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13&amp;nbsp;inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.

=== 2007 relaunch ===
In 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]'' and immediately before with a new TV series ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''. The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by [[SD Entertainment]].

As part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in ''[[Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!]]''). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear,&lt;ref name="cbcollectlist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |title=Care Bears: New Collection |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Play Along Toys]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829092833/http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/collectors/newfall07.aspx |archivedate=August 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |title=Care Bears FAQ's |format=Flash |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |publisher=Play Along Toys |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223132206/http://playalongtoys.com/carebears/faq.aspx |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their new theme song is performed by former [[Letters to Cleo]] member, [[Kay Hanley]], and the music video premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In August 2007, they appeared in the film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |last=Strowbridge |first=C.S. |title=Limited Releases Are Very Becoming |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |work=The Numbers |publisher=Nash Information Services LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611082352/http://www.the-numbers.com/interactive/newsStory.php?newsID=2748 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. The series premiered on [[CBS]]' ''[[KEWLopolis]]'' block on September 15, 2007.

The Care Bears franchise was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (''Grizzle-ly Adventures''), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' states that in the new version, "they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight".&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;

However, the Caring Meter made its return in ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, ''Ups and Downs'', included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, ''Play Day''.

On July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with ''[[Strawberry Shortcake]]'') would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/466030--cookie-jar-buys-care-bears-strawberry-shortcake |author=Associated Press (AP) |title=Cookie Jar buys Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake |date=July 23, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise.

In late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, "Care Power Team". This re-imagining re-used the ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'' designs, has the bears sport "enhanced belly badges", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: ''[[Care Bears: Share Bear Shines]]'', ''[[Care Bears: The Giving Festival]]'' and ''Care Bears: To the Rescue''. In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.

=== 2012 relaunch ===
In July 2011, the card company announced that a new television series, the franchise's first in CGI, is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/care-bears-star-new-cgi-208438 |last=Bond |first=Paul |title=Care Bears to Star in New CGI-Animated TV Show |date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[e5 Global Media]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710035247/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/care-bears-star-new-cgi-208438 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot]]'', it premiered on [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] on June 2, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-hub-television-network-unveils-2012-13-program-slate-with-four-new-original-series-joining-eight-returning-original-series-2012-03-01 |author=[[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]] |title=The Hub Television Network Unveils 2012-'13 Program Slate With Four New Original Series Joining Eight Returning Original Series |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |work=[[MarketWatch]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418145726/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-hub-television-network-unveils-2012-13-program-slate-with-four-new-original-series-joining-eight-returning-original-series-2012-03-01 |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced they will collaborate with [[Sanrio]] for a co-branding with the character franchise ''Little Twin Stars''. An expanded rollout is expected in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/12/04/care-bears-and-little-twin-stars-enter-co-branding-program/ |title=Care Bears and Little Twin Stars enter co-branding program |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215063349/http://kidscreen.com/2013/12/04/care-bears-and-little-twin-stars-enter-co-branding-program/ |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called ''Just Play''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |title=Care Bears count down to new toy line |website=Kidscreen |date=August 12, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029203238/http://kidscreen.com/2014/08/12/care-bears-count-down-to-new-toy-line/ |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.

In October 2014, When [[Hub Network|The Hub]] changed over to [[Discovery Family]], it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.

In January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called ''Care Bears and Cousins'' after The Hub cancelled ''Welcome to Care-a-Lot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |title=Netflix reviving Care Bears with new series set for 2016 |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=April 29, 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135123/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/13/netflix-care-bears |archive-date=May 9, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.

=== 2018 relaunch ===
In September 2018, a new television series, titled ''Care Bears: Unlock the Magic'', was announced. The series is to premiere on the [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts. The series will introduce a new character named Dibble, who will serve as "the team"s newest pet and companion". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=ToonBarnTweets|number=999141838022938624|title=Care Bears: Unlock the Magic Licensing Expo 2018 ad.

== Characters and universe ==
{{fanpov|section|date=August 2018}}
{{Main|List of Care Bear characters}}
The franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' referred to them as "the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents{{sic}} of what we used to know as [[guardian angel]]s: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the [[Easter Bunny]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ashkinaze |first=Carole |title=Editorial: In quest to be Mayor, Lomax's Achilles heel was his own image |date=August 11, 1989 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |page=A23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.

The ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.

For the new 2007 TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]'', five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.

Some elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of [[King Arthur]]. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary [[Camelot]] castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, [[Sir Lancelot]]'s name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.&lt;ref name=cbsite /&gt;

Throughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against [[Professor Coldheart]], his assistant [[Frostbite (Care Bears)|Frostbite]], and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant [[Beastly (Care Bears)|Beastly]] and his ill-tempered niece [[Shreeky]], and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', [[Dark Heart (Care Bears)|Dark Heart]] in ''[[Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation]]'', The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim &amp; Dumb in ''[[The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland]]'', and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in ''Care Bears Nutcracker Suite''. Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'', while ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, ''[[Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot]]''.

=== Magic spells ===
The Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the "Care Bear Stare" (a.k.a. "Belly Magic"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' and ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'' do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in ''Oopsy Does It!''. In the new series, ''Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot'', the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.

In the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears...prepare to stare!" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase "Care Bears Countdown!"

During the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the "Care Bear Cousin Call". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.

Although commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in ''Adventures in Care-a-lot'', when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode "Tell-Tale belly".

In addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.

=== Caring meter ===
Shown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In ''The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie'', the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on "caring missions" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as [[thunderstorms]], buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring ''anywhere''), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.

Initially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in ''Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!'' and the first season of ''Adventures in Care-a-lot''. With the release of ''Grizzle-y Adventures'', the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.

== Merchandise ==
Apart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in [[merchandising]] as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods.&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt; During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and [[Spencer Gifts]].&lt;ref name="cbfaq" /&gt;

When the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.&lt;ref name="cbsite" /&gt;

In his 1986 essay, ''The Shortcake Strategy'', Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as "highly specialized" toys. "So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality", he stated. "Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit."&lt;ref name=pantheon&gt;{{cite book |last=Engelhardt |first=Tom |editor1-last=Gitlin |editor1-first=Todd |title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture |chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy |page=98 |isbn=0-394-74651-1 |year=1986 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] ([[Random House]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Books ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears books}}
Many children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include "Meet the Care Bear Cousins" (based on the first movie), "Sweet Dreams for Sally", "The Witch Down the Street", "The Trouble with Timothy", and "A Sister for Sam". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt; As of 2006, [[Scholastic Press]] has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.

In ''Playing by Different Rules'', a 1988 book chronicling the [[Parker Brothers]]/[[General Mills]] merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) "were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?"&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite book |last=Wojahn |first=Ellen |title=Playing by Different Rules |chapter=Fold |page=217 |isbn=0-8144-5861-0 |year=1988 |publisher=American Management Association (amacom)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comics ==
Between November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]]; the books were drawn by [[DC Comics]] artist Howard Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Care Bears] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

[https://www.webcitation.org/66uZzvdc2?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/carebear.htm Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the [[Madballs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |author="Wes" |title=''Care Bears'' No. 13 ... in which the Care Bears meat the Madballs |year=2008 |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |publisher=Scary-Crayon |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014222444/http://www.scary-crayon.com/print/careballs/ |archivedate=October 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.

== Music ==
{{Main|List of Care Bears albums}}
At the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, [[Kid Stuff Records]] released several LPs based on the franchise. These included "Introducing the Care Bears", "The Care Bears Care For You", "Adventures in Care-a-lot", "The Care Bears' Birthday Party", and "The Care Bears' Christmas" (all from 1983), and 1986's "Friends Make Everything Better" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.&lt;ref name="cbhistory" /&gt;

All of the albums from 1983 (except for "Birthday Party") featured writing, production, and performance credits from [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]] (who were the lead singers of [[The Turtles]], also known as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]]; former [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] from [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from [[The Care Bears Movie]] featured songs by [[Carole King]] and [[John Sebastian]], who sang lead for [[The Lovin' Spoonful]].

In the midst of the 2002 revival, [[Madacy Entertainment|Madacy Kids]] released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, ''Meet the Care Bears'', ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'', ''Care Bears Christmas Eve'', and the ''Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot'' soundtrack album came out, as well as ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' the following year.

The cover of both ''Care Bears Holiday Hugs'' and ''Care Bears Nighty-Night'' advertises another two CDs, called ''Care Bears Share A Smile'' and ''Care Bears Let's Be Friends''. As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.

== Music videos ==
Approximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single "[[I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer]]" from Swedish rock band [[The Cardigans]]' sixth studio album ''[[Super Extra Gravity]]'', there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.

A Care Bears game was planned for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="protoCBGame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |title=Care Bears |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |publisher=Atari Protos |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103164456/http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/carebear/carebear.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha]] of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.

In 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, ''Care-a-lot Jamboree'' for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, ''Let's Have a Ball!'' was released. In the same year they were featured in ''Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring'' for the [[V.Smile]] educational game console.

In 2005, they appeared in ''Catch a Star'' (also for the PC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Entertainment briefs column |date=October 15, 2005 |work=[[Ventura County Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Care Bears: Care Quest'' (for the [[Game Boy Advance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Teachers' Picks: Best New Tech |date=May 1, 2006 |work=Scholastic Parent and Child |publisher=Scholastic Press |volume=13 |number=6 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, ''Care Bears Play Day'', was released for the [[V.Smile]] Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.

them, ''Care Bears Share-A-Story'', was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a [[Teddy Ruxpin]]. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as [[The Three Bears|Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears]], [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and the [[Three Little Pigs]]. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.playalongtoys.com/press/pr_050606_CB.aspx |title=Storytime Has Never Been So Magical!

Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.

Additionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Another Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Lastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called ''Hide 'N Seek Care Bears'', comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''''Child's Play''''' (also called '''''Chucky''''') is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] centered on a series of seven films created by [[Don Mancini]]. The films mainly focus on [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]), a notorious [[serial killer]] known as the "Lakeshore Strangler" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to [[Hell]]. The original film, ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child’s Play]]'', was released on November{{nbsp}}9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/08/curse-of-chucky-25-years/2861753/|title=After 25 years, Chucky is both a blessing and a 'Curse'|author=Bryan Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Horror Franchise.

The film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment ''Child’s Play'', which appears to have more [[psychological horror]] elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of [[black comedy|dark humor]]. As the films progressed, they became [[satirical]] and [[campy]], until the series briefly became a [[horror comedy]], with 1998's ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and be released direct-to-video. Unlike ''Bride'' and ''Seed'', ''Curse of Chucky'' is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since ''Bride of Chucky'', titles have no longer been released under the ''Child's Play'' brand name and now use ''Chucky'' and will continue to do so with future films.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/24/new-childs-play-sequel-curse-of-chucky-coming-to-dvd|title=New Child's Play sequel, Curse of Chucky, Coming to DVD|publisher=IGN|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest installment to the series, titled ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'', was released on October{{nbsp}}3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/01/05/cult-chucky-sequel-childs-play|author=Clark Collins|title=Cult of Chucky: Horror sequel plot details, teaser video revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 5, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of ''Seed of Chucky'', a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'', set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled ''Chucky Invades'' was released in the run-up to the release of ''Curse of Chucky''. On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s ''[[Monday Nitro]]'' program as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], taunting wrestler [[Rick Steiner]] who was a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] at the time and promoting ''Bride of Chucky''.

Lars Klevberg will direct the film, with a script from Tyler Burton Smith (of ''[[Polaroid (film)|Polaroid]]'' and ''[[Quantum Break]]'' fame, respectively).

In an interview with ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' Mancini discussed the potential of a ''Child's Play'' film set on a train&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as ''Chucky on the Orient Express''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the [[Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]], tentatively referred to as ''Child’s Play on Elm Street''.&lt;ref name=bloody-disgusting.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3319172/childs-play-train-freddy-vs-chucky-don-mancini-dreams/|author=Brad Miska|title=‘Child’s Play’ On a Train? Freddy Vs. Chucky? Don Mancini Dreams…|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act," he explains. "I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up?&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as "cool and doable", confirming that the film would be titled ''Child’s Play on Elm Street'' and that he was currently in discussion with [[New Line Cinema]] about the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1693069/child-plays-writer-has-the-best-idea-for-a-chucky-crossover-with-freddy-krueger|title=Child Play's Writer Has The Best Idea For A Chucky Crossover With Freddy Krueger|date=17 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'', in which [[Freddy Krueger]]'s [[Freddy Krueger#Bladed Glove|bladed glove]] had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-chucky|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Chucky|first=Mark|last=Langshaw|date=26 October 2017|website=WhatCulture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV Series===
In February 2018, it was announced that a television series titled ''Child's Play: The TV Series'', is in development with involvement from franchise creator Don Mancini, and producer David Kirschner. The show will share continuity with the original film series, and be a continuation of that story. Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed.&lt;ref name="comingsoon.net"/&gt; By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee "Chucky" Ray.&lt;ref name="TVSeries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3505915/don-mancini-teases-childs-play-tv-series-coming-soon|title=Don Mancini Teases "Child’s Play: The TV Series," Coming Soon!|first=John|last=Squires|date=22 June 2018|website=Bloody Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short films==
===''Chucky's Vacation Slides''===
On the home media [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] release of ''Seed of Chucky'' in 2005, a short film entitled ''Chucky's Vacation Slides'' was included in the special features. The short, set during the events of ''Seed of Chucky'', follows Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen after having returned from a family vacation. The film implies that the events of ''Seed of Chucky'' take place over the course of 5–10 years. While browsing through their photographs of their vacation on a slide projector, Tiffany notices various corpses in the background of certain photographs, realizing that Chucky has been killing people again. Tiffany leaves, with a distraught and sickened Glen, while Chucky continues to view the photographs. After a delivery man arrives with a pizza, Chucky leads him to his garage and kills him off-screen. Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly and Billy Boyd all reprise their roles from the films.

===''Chucky Invades''===
Leading up to the DVD release of ''Curse of Chucky'' in 2013, a series of short film videos were released. The clips showed Chucky interrupting the events of several other horror films. Brad Dourif and Edan Gross reprised their roles as Chucky and the Good Guy Doll, respectively.

*'''[[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky / Charles Lee Ray]]''' (played by [[Brad Dourif]])&lt;br&gt;The primary character in the fourth and fifth films and antagonist of the series. A merciless, wisecracking murderer whose soul gets stuck in a doll. He usually kills 'anyone' who gets in his way with a knife or any other weapon he finds and frames the hero of each film for them. Although being a deranged killer, he has a twisted sense of humor and often spouts comically vulgar insults. He is the only character to appear in all of the films in the franchise and appears in his human body in the first and, in the sixth movie, by flashbacks.
* '''[[Andy Barclay|Andrew William "Andy" Barclay]]''' (played by [[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]] and [[Justin Whalin]]) &lt;br&gt; The original protagonist. Pursued by Chucky so he could transfer his soul into the boy's body, but Andy always prevents Chucky from taking over his body, as well as successfully framing him for the murders. He appears in all three installments of the Child's Play trilogy and the sixth and seventh Chucky films. He is indirectly mentioned in ''Bride'' and ''Seed''.
*'''Karen Barclay''' (played by [[Catherine Hicks]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's mother, and later Mike's wife. She buys him a Good Guy doll for his birthday, unaware that the one she picked was possessed by a serial killer. Initially, she refuses to believe that Chucky was alive, but she soon finds out when he comes alive and tries to kill her. In ''Child's Play 2'', she is written out of the story when she was taken away to an insane asylum when no one believes her about the murderous doll. She appears only in the first film and is mentioned in the second, third and sixth films. In the sixth film, Karen talks to Andy over the phone, which reveals that she is now free from the asylum and plans to cook dinner for Andy's upcoming birthday. It is also strongly hinted that she has married Mike.
*'''Detective Mike Norris''' (played by [[Chris Sarandon]])&lt;br&gt;A detective investigating the murder of Andy's babysitter. He is also responsible for Chucky's death prompting him to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll. He initially refuses to believe the Barclays, but when Chucky tries to kill him, he becomes an ally to the family. In ''Child’s Play 2'', however, it is mildly implied that both Mike and Jack denied the ordeal to protect the reputation of the Chicago police department. Appears only in the first film, and is indirectly mentioned in the second and fourth films. He appears via archive footage in ''Curse of Chucky'' (namely, pictures on the internet). He was originally set to appear in ''Seed of Chucky'' but didn’t return due to scheduling conflicts.
*'''Kyle''' (played by [[Christine Elise]]) &lt;br&gt; Andy's teenage foster sister whom he ends up staying with. At first, she finds Andy to be a pain on her side but starts to back up his story about Chucky when she witnesses him trying to take his soul and later finds their foster mother murdered by Chucky. She then goes to find Andy and ends up saving his life in the Play Pals factory, as well as helping him destroy Chucky after he tries to kill him after the voodoo soul transfer spell goes awry. She appears in the second film and was written out of the series and was never seen again but was briefly mentioned in the third film when Andy re-encounters Chucky again. She was also briefly mentioned to have kept in contact with Andy in ''Curse'' as he kept a photo of her. Kyle later returned in ''Cult'' in the post-credits scene where actress [[Christine Elise]] reprised her role.
*'''Mr. Sullivan''' (played by [[Peter Haskell]])&lt;br&gt;The greedy and arrogant CEO of Good Guy Toys Inc., First appears in ''Child's Play 2'' upon learning of Andy's Good Guy Doll supposedly becoming possessed by the soul of Charles Lee Ray, and tries to protect the company's reputation from angry stockholders. He also appears in ''Child’s Play 3'' when he moves Good Guy Toys forward with producing more dolls, however, he is killed by Chucky when he accesses Sullivan's office computer to find Andy in Military School. 
*'''Ronald Tyler''' (played by Jeremy Sylvers)&lt;br&gt;A young private boy who befriends Andy at the military school he is sent to after failing to cope with living at several foster homes. When he finds Chucky (who mailed himself to the same military school to go after Andy again), he decides to go after Tyler instead. At first, Tyler finds Chucky to be a nice guy but realizes the true colours of the doll's evil murderous ways once he attempts to transfer his soul into his body much like he attempted to do with Andy in the first two films. Appears in the third film, only to be written out of the series but was originally going to be killed off alongside Andy in the original draft to ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Kristen De Silva''' (played by [[Perrey Reeves]])&lt;br&gt;Andy's girlfriend at the military school he attends, ends up sticking up for him when Shelton and the other guys take a liking in bullying him. Appears only in the third film.
*'''Jack Santos''' (played by Tommy Swerdlow)&lt;br&gt;Mike's partner who was also investigating Andy's babysitter's death. In the beginning of the first film, he was mostly the cop who drove Mike's car to chase Eddie Caputo in his van. He was also one of the police officers that believed Andy was the killer. During the end, he tried to show Mike that Chucky wasn't alive, but was nearly killed by him and then he believed that the Barclays and Mike were telling the truth. He only appeared in the first film.
*'''[[Tiffany Valentine]]''' (played by [[Jennifer Tilly]])&lt;br&gt;Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend (and later wife/partner) who later gets her soul stuck in a doll like Chucky. She ultimately transfers her soul into actress Jennifer Tilly (her doppelganger and portrayer) in ''Seed'' after being fed up with her husband's intent to remain a doll. In ''Curse'', she is shown to be living a double life as both her regular self and Tilly. Appears in ''Bride'', ''Seed'', ''Curse'' and ''Cult''. 
*'''[[Jennifer Tilly]]''' (played by herself)&lt;br&gt;An exaggerated version of Tilly, herself, and Tiffany's idol. She first appears in ''Bride'' under her role as Tiffany. Appears in ''Seed'' as herself and the voice of Tiffany. Tiffany was successful in transferring her soul into Tilly's body. Also appears in Curse and Cult.
*'''[[Glen]]''' (played by [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] and human form portrayed by Beans Balawi)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's original child and Glenda's twin brother. He was an orphan for the first five or six years of his life until he saw his parents on television. Glen is a good person, and he doesn't like violence and definitely does not like murder unlike his parents. Though Tiffany promised him that they will refrain from killing, Chucky tries to get Glen involved in the family business. He fears but still loves his dad due to the fact he killed him in a misunderstanding. He is the only living doll character not to be voiced by an [[Academy Award]] nominee. Appears in ''Bride'' (at the end as an infant) and ''Seed''. He does not appear in ''Curse'', nor is there any mention of him. 
*'''Glenda Ray''' (human form played by Kristina Hewitt)&lt;br&gt;Chucky and Tiffany's second child and the twin sister of Glen. She was originally Glen's alter ego for a brief moment, but was reborn as a human. Unlike Glen, she is violent, sadistic, and cruel. She is even more ruthless than her father, implying she possibly will take on the family business. Appears in ''Seed''.
*'''Jesse Miller''' (played by [[Nick Stabile]])&lt;br&gt;The former friend of Tiffany Ray and boyfriend of Jade. He was greatly disliked by Jade's uncle and believed to be responsible for his death until Chucky and Tiffany reveal themselves. In the end, Jade kills Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. He also appears in a ''Chucky'' comic continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.
*'''Jade Kincaid''' (played by [[Katherine Heigl]])&lt;br&gt;The girlfriend of Jesse. Her uncle Warren is killed by Chucky and Tiffany early in the film. In the end, Jade shoots Chucky and she and Jesse leave the scene. She also appears with Jesse in another struggle with Chucky in a comic book continuation. Appears in ''Bride of Chucky'' and mentioned in ''Seed of Chucky''.

==Music==
[[Joe Renzetti]] composed the first ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child’s Play]]'', followed by [[Graeme Revell]], who composed the soundtrack for ''[[Child's Play 2|Child’s Play 2]]'' and ''[[Bride of Chucky]]''. [[John D'Andrea]] and [[Cory Lerios]] wrote the score for ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]'', while [[Pino Donaggio]] composed ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''. [[Joseph LoDuca]] composed the score for ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' and ''[[Cult of Chucky]]''.

==Controversies==

The following crimes have been associated with the ''Child’s Play'' films:

In December 1992 four people who [[Murder of Suzanne Capper#Torture|tortured and killed]] 16-year-old  Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the ''Child's Play'' movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (''Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)'' by 150 Volts, featuring [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from the movie ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sadistic Killers: Profiles of pathological predators|first=Carol Anne|last=Davis|year=2007|publisher=Summersdale Publishing|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1-84024-581-3|authorlink=Carol Anne Davis|pages=298–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] were said to have been influenced by the film ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]''. The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor [[James Ferman]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2605543.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Film censor Ferman dies|date=December 25, 2002|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including ''Chucky'' films, from the age of about six or seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/8235661.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Boys' mother 'fed them cannabis'|date=September 3, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Cleaners (serial killers)|Elena Lobacheva]], a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film ''Bride of Chucky'', which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-serial-killer-elena-lobacheva-bride-chucky-sexual-pleasure-killing-jailed-a8022326.html|title = ''Bride of Chucky'' serial killer who derived sexual pleasure from killing jailed|last = McIntyre|first = Niamh|publisher = ''[[The Independent]]''|date = 26 October 2017|website = independent.co.uk|accessdate = 28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic books==

===Innovation Publishing===
Beginning in 1992, [[Innovation Publishing]] released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 2''. It was later collected in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled ''Child’s Play: The Series'', ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of ''Child’s Play 3''.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
In 2007, [[Devil's Due Publishing]] obtained the license to publish ''Child's Play'' comics and released a one-shot crossover with [[Hack/Slash]] titled ''Hack/Slash vs. Chucky'' which takes place after the events of the ''Seed of Chucky'' film. This was followed by a four-issue series called ''Chucky''. A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.

==Video game==
{{main|Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash}}
Slimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''. The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet ''Child’s Play'' video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.

In the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=''Child’s Play'' Killer Chucky The Unlikely Hero of Endless Runner ''Chucky: Slash &amp; Dash''|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2468019/childs-play-killer-chucky-the-unlikely-hero-of-endless-runner-chucky-slash-dash/|work=MTV|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app was released on November 1, 2013.

==Halloween Horror Nights==
Since 1992, [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] has starred in his own shows at [[Universal Studios]] ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'', entitled, ''Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults'' and ''Chucky's Insult Emporium''.

In 2009, the climax of ''[[Child's Play 3|Child’s Play 3]]'' received its own maze, entitled ''Chucky's Fun House''. ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'' has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.

In 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains [[Leatherface]], [[Freddy Krueger]], and [[Jason Voorhees]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19079">'''Cinephilia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|i|ə}}; also '''cinemaphilia''' or '''filmophilia''') is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in [[film]]s, [[film theory]], and [[film criticism]]. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[Film|cinema]] and [[philia]], one of the four ancient [[Greek words for love]].&lt;ref name="de-Valck"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Cinephilia: Movies, Love and Memory|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2005|isbn=90-5356-768-2|location=Amsterdam|editor1-first=Marijke|editor1-last=de Valck|editor2-first=Malte|editor2-last=Hagener}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with a passionate interest in cinema is called a '''cinephile''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|ɪ|f|aɪ|l}}), '''cinemaphile''', '''filmophile''', or, informally, a '''film buff''' (also '''movie buff''').

In English, "cinephile" is sometimes used interchangeably with the word '''cineaste''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|i|ˌ|æ|s|t|,_|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|eɪ|-}}), though in the original French the term ''cinéaste'' ({{IPA-fr|sineast|}}) refers to a cinephile who is also a filmmaker.

==Definition==
In a review of a book on the history of cinephilia, Mas Generis writes: "Cinephilia, is the condition of a sexual attraction to movies."&lt;ref name="generis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Generis |first1=Mas |date=11 December 2006 |title=Cinephilia now: review of ''Cinephilia: movies, love and memory'' |journal=Screening the Past |issue=20 |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/20/cinephilia-movies-love-memory.html  |publisher=[[LaTrobe University]] |accessdate=November 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generis also introduces a quote from [[film scholar]] Annette Michelson that states that there is, "No one such thing as cinephilia, but rather forms and periods of cinephilia."&lt;ref name="generis" /&gt; As described by Antoine de Baecque and [[Thierry Frémaux]], "The definitive essence of cinephila is a culture of the discarded that prefers to find intellectual coherence where none is evident and to eulogize the non-standard and the minor."&lt;ref name="keathley"&gt;Keathley, Christian. Cinephilia and history, or, The wind in the trees. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film historian Thomas Elsaesser wrote that it "reverberates with nostalgia and dedication... more than a passion of going to the movies and only a little less than an entire attitude towards life".&lt;ref&gt;[https://filmschoolrejects.com/is-fandom-the-new-cinephilia-585391abb8b2/ "Is Fandom the New Cinephilia?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the beginning of the [[silent era]], there have been [[Film society|film clubs]] and publications in which people who felt passionately about cinema could discuss their interests and see rare and older works. At the beginning of the [[sound film|sound era]], there were more and more people interested in seeing older films, which led to the establishment of organizations such as the [[Cinémathèque Française]], the first major archive devoted to [[film preservation]].

===Post-war French cinephilia===

Perhaps the most notable cinephilic community of the 20th century was the one that developed in Paris in the decades following World War II. An influx of foreign films that had been withheld during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|Occupation]], as well as the screening programs of local [[film society|film clubs]] and the [[Cinémathèque Française]], generated interest in [[world cinema]] amongst the city's [[intellectual]] [[youth culture]]. In general, the cinephiles of the period set a template for future like-minded groups by having keen enthusiasm for both older and contemporary films.&lt;ref name="richard"&gt;Le fantôme d'Henri Langlois. Dir. Jacques Richard. DVD. Kino Video, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential film clubs of the period included Objectif 49, whose members included [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], and the Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter). ''Revue du Cinéma'', a magazine published by members of the two clubs, later evolved into the influential film magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]''.

Many of the people who attended the screenings became [[film critic]]s and later [[filmmakers]], founding the film movement known as the [[French New Wave]]. [[André Bazin]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Jacques Doniol-Valcroze]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alexandre Astruc]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Luc Moullet]] and others were regulars, and several, most notably Truffaut, maintained their ties to the community after they had achieved fame.

The community fostered an interest in [[Film director|directors]] and [[film]]s that had been neglected, forgotten or simply unknown in the West, and led to the development of the [[auteur theory]]. The directors the French cinephiles of the period had strong interests in included [[F. W. Murnau]], [[Robert Flaherty]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Jean Renoir]], [[Jean Vigo]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Anthony Mann]], [[Louis Feuillade]], [[D. W. Griffith]], the [[Lumière Brothers]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Georges Méliès]], whose films would be screened from [[nitrate film|nitrate prints]] on special occasions.&lt;ref name="richard" /&gt;

===Filmgoing in the 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Federico Fellini.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The Italian director [[Federico Fellini]], a fashionable figure in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, owed part of his popularity to the support of [[film critics]] and the distribution of [[foreign films]] in order to accommodate the increasingly sophisticated public.]]

With the popular success of the [[French New Wave]], film-going became fashionable in Europe and America.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt; [[Revival house|Revival screenings]] and independently run cinemas specializing in [[foreign film]]s became increasingly common. In the United States, New York City was often seen as the center of cinephile culture,&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt; due to the wide variety of films available to see at any given time. This culture was also helped by the popularity in America of figures such like [[Pauline Kael]], [[Andrew Sarris]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name="keathley" /&gt; Certain writers and critics, including Sontag, would later come to view this as the "[[golden age]]" of film-going in the US.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keathley" /&gt; Directors such as [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the US and influenced the young generation of film enthusiasts who would become the [[New Hollywood]], including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Woody Allen]]. Due to growing public interest in [[foreign film|films from other countries]], specialty [[film distributor|distributors]] such as [[Janus Films]] and [[New Yorker Films]] began importing and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] foreign movies.

The era also saw the growth of college film societies in the US. Though some, like [[Doc Films]] at the [[University of Chicago]], had existed since the 1930s, the 1960s saw directors of all generations regularly make appearances at college campuses, whether to revisit their old films or to discuss new ones.

At the same time, the Parisian cinephilic culture became increasingly politicized. Critics, and by extension the cinephiles who followed their work, began to emphasize political aspects of films and directors. Though many of the major figures of the post-war community has been originally aligned with the [[Right (politics)|political right]]—including most of the ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'' group—by the late 1960s ''Cahiers'' and the young cinephile public in general had aligned with various forms of the [[Left (politics)|Left]], with some figures, such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]], aligning with [[Maoism]]. In this very politicized climate, cinema was often seen as directly connected to [[Marxism]]. Many members of this new generation of cinephiles would become [[film critic|critics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/film/cinephobia-2129482 Cinephobia-Manohla Dargis of The LA Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[film director|directors]], including [[Serge Daney]], [[Philippe Garrel]], and [[Andre Techine]].

Though most of the world's major film festivals had existed for decades by this point—including the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Venice Film Festival]]—the period saw the establishment of festivals in nearly every major city. The [[New York Film Festival]], the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] were all started during this time. The [[Toronto International Film Festival]], often seen as second only to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in terms of importance, was founded towards the end of this period, in 1976.

[[File:Wong Kar-wai at 2008 TIFF.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Wong Kar-wai]] (''pictured'') is a renowned [[arthouse]] film director from Hong Kong.]]

As [[VHS]] tapes and later [[DVD]]s became more common, cinephilia became less associated with filmgoing in theatres.&lt;ref name="de-Valck" /&gt;

While [[Japanese language|Japanese]] films have enjoyed worldwide distribution in the mid 20th century, the late 20th century saw an increase in interest amongst cinephiles in cinema from other Asian countries, especially China, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and, later, [[Thailand]].

===Contemporary cinephilia===
[[File:Michael Mann - French Cinematheque - 4th July 2009.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Though his films have met with mixed commercial success, American director [[Michael Mann]] (pictured above at [[Cinémathèque Française]] in 2009) is often considered to be a major figure by contemporary cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theauteurs.com/notebook/posts/828 The Auteurs' Notebook: Anticipating "Public Enemies"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://somecamerunning.typepad.com/some_came_running/2009/07/the-mann-act-public-enemies.html Glenn Kenny: The Mann Act]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Since the beginning of the 21st century, [[blogging]] has become a large part of cinephile culture. In the [[English-speaking world]], established critics and theorists like [[Dave Kehr]], [[David Bordwell]], [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], [[Glenn Kenny]], [[Wheeler Winston Dixon]] and [[Adrian Martin]], as well as non-professional cinephiles like [[Girish Shambu]] and [[Acquarello]], play key roles in building interest in films or theories amongst cinephiles by writing and communicating through blogs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/nd08/fccrisis.htm Film Comment: Film Criticism in Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211045039/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/nd08/fccrisis.htm |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Online forum|Forums]] and [[podcast]]s have become popular ways to stir discussion, allowing cinephiles from different countries and cultures to discuss ideas about film. The [[social networking]] and [[video streaming]] service [[Mubi (website)|Mubi]] caters specifically to cinephiles, allowing its members access to films that sometimes haven't been distributed theatrically or on video in their home countries. Home video distribution labels such as [[The Criterion Collection]] and [[Masters of Cinema]] cater to cinephiles, often including large amounts of supplemental and [[film criticism|critical]] material with their releases.

As was the case with the French cinephilia of the post-war era, the international cinephilic community that has developed on the Internet often emphasizes films and figures that do not have strong critical or popular recognition, including many directors who work within [[genre film]], in what is sometimes dubbed [[vulgar auteurism]]. These include [[Abel Ferrara]], [[Bela Tarr]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]], [[Park Chan-wook]], [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], [[Philippe Garrel]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Lucrecia Martel]] and [[Jose Luis Guerin]].

==Cinephilia and filmmaking==
[[File:Quentin Tarantino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|140px|right|American director and cinephile [[Quentin Tarantino]] often makes references in his work to movies and directors he admires.]]

Throughout the history of cinema, there have been numerous directors who developed their understanding of cinema through filmgoing and participation in cinephile communities and organizations instead of within the formal settings of either a [[film school]] or a [[film studio]]. Directors who began as cinephiles include [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Ed Wood]], [[Andre Techine]], [[Pedro Costa]], [[Brian de Palma]], [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Wes Anderson]], [[Éric Rohmer]], [[Hal Hartley]]  and [[Aki Kaurismäki]].

The directors of the [[French New Wave]], who learned about filmmaking by attending screenings at [[film society|film clubs]] and discussing movies amongst themselves, are often seen as models for cinephiles. Their intellectual [[omnivorousness]], which equated an interest in cinema with strong understandings of [[literature]], [[art]] and sometimes [[philosophy]], has continued to have influence on cinephiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-movies-arent-dying-theyre-not-even-sick The Movies Aren't Dying (They're Not Even Sick)-Richard Brody of The New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, many directors emphasize their lack of cinephilia or interest in movies. [[Abbas Kiarostami]], popular with cinephiles, often emphasized his disinterest in cinema when interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Abbas Kiarostami (Contemporary Film Directors). New York: University of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinephobia===
There has also been different forms of ''cinephobia'' (fear or hatred of cinema)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0278.xml#]&lt;/ref&gt; from the current fear of "losing" celluloid film in the digital age through anxieties about moral values on the big screen to the point of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[www.lolajournal.com/5/cinephobia.html

==Telephilia&lt;!--'Telephilia' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Telephilia'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the term used to refer to a passionate interest in [[television]].

===Definition===
It was coined by ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Frank Rich, in a pejorative way, as "the pathological longing of Americans, no matter how talentless, to be on television".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/print.php?id=12562&amp;type=2|title=The Namibian|website=www.namibian.com.na}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
For years, television was frowned upon as inferior to film until the advent of [[quality television]] in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/cultivating-tv-aesthetics|title=Cultivating TV aesthetics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when recording and reproduction technologies allowed the spectator to release his/her viewing from the palimpsest's rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41552408|title=Cinephilia/Telephilia|first1=Francesco|last1=Casetti|first2=Mariagrazia|last2=Fanchi|date=17 August 2017|publisher=|journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media|volume=45|issue=2|pages=38–41|doi=10.2307/41552408}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1112415581/cinephilia-telephilia] Cinephilia/Telephilia

===Telephilia from 2000s onwards===
Anti-heroic series like ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' were cited as improving television content thus earning critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;

It also rivals cinephilia for relevance as production values are higher than ever before on shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/05/telephilia-has-television-become-a-more-relevant-american-medium-than-art-film-38350/|title=Telephilia: Has Television Become a More Relevant American Medium Than Art Film?|first=Celluloid Liberation|last=Front|website=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this development, there are still intellectuals &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BOgUyPYw0KoC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=telephilia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w5JGf56BlM&amp;sig=0hWr8bTEGoz0xFpn7iGkOUnelyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOpZvB6sTeAhXl7YMKHTLpDDE4FBDoATADegQIBRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=telephilia&amp;f=false Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media-Robert Miklitsch-Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; who consider telephilia as inferior to cinephilia particularly in cases of obsessions for modern television programs belonging to genres such as [[melodrama]] and [[soap opera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|last=Miklitsch|first=Robert|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2006|isbn=0791467333|location=New York|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also explained by the view that highlighted the unattainable nature of the cinema, which makes it more desirable and extraordinary since it features a regime of presence-yet-absence filmic image, allowing a form of cinematic stardom capable of triggering a series of psychic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema of Takeshi Kitano: Flowering Blood|last=Redmond|first=Sean|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780231163323|location=New York|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with television, which is perceived to be more present and immediate - with its stars "famous only in so far as he or she makes frequent television appearances."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some observers, however, note that there is now a destabilization of traditional notions of what constitutes cinephilic tendency due to the availability of film on [[Home video|home media]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cult Media: Re-packaged, Re-released and Restored|last=Wroot|first=Jonathan|last2=Willis|first2=Andy|publisher=Pagrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=9783319636788|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clown''' is a comic [[performer]] who employs [[slapstick]] or similar types of [[physical comedy]], often in a [[mime artist|mime]] style.

== History ==
[[File:1954 Episode of the TV series "Super Circus".ogg|thumb|left|Video of a 1954 episode of the ''[[Super Circus]]'' show.]]

Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the ''[[Circus clown#The auguste|Auguste]]'' or "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, [[exaggerated]] footwear, and colourful clothing. Their entertainment style is generally designed to entertain large audiences. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the [[circus clown]], which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or ''Varieté'' shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right. The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] in the [[harlequinade]] that formed part of British [[pantomime]]s, notably at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and the [[Sadler's Wells]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] theatres. He became so dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were, and still are, used by other types of clowns.

The [[comedy]] that clowns perform is usually in the role of a fool whose everyday actions and tasks become extraordinary—and for whom the ridiculous, for a short while, becomes ordinary. This style of comedy has a long history in many countries and cultures across the world. Some writers have argued that due to the widespread use of such comedy and its long history it is a need that is part of the human condition. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The "fear of clowns," circus clowns in particular as a psychiatric condition has become known by the term [[coulrophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Crosswell |first=Julia |contribution=clown |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |edition={{subscription}} online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t292.e1047 |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin ===
The "''clown''" character developed out of the [[zanni]] "''rustic fool''" characters of the early modern [[commedia dell'arte]], which were themselves directly based on the "''rustic fool''" characters of ancient [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]].
Rustic buffoon characters in Classical Greek theater were known as '' sklêro-paiktês'' (from ''paizein'' "to play (like a child)") or ''deikeliktas'', besides other generic terms for "rustic" or "peasant". In Roman theater, a term for clown was ''fossor'', literally "digger; labourer".

The English word ''[[:wikt:clown|clown]]'' was first recorded c. 1560 (as ''clowne,  cloyne'') in the generic meaning  "rustic, boor, peasant". 
The origin of the word is uncertain, perhaps from a Scandinavian word cognate with ''clumsy''.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic ''klunni'', Swedish ''kluns'' "clumsy, boorish person";  c.f. North Frisian  ''klönne'' and "kluns", also meaning "clumsy person". An alternative proposal derives ''clown'' from Latin ''colonus'' "colonist, farmer".
The verb ''to clown''  "to play the clown onstage" is from about 1600. {{cite web|title=Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clown&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is in this sense that "Clown" is used as the name of [[Shakespearean fool|fool characters]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''.
The sense of ''clown'' as referring to a professional or habitual fool or jester developed soon after 1600, based on [[Elizabethan theater|Elizabethan]] "rustic fool" characters such as Shakespeare's.

The [[harlequinade]] developed in England in the 17th century, inspired by the commedia dell'arte. It was here that "Clown" came into use as the given name of a stock character. Originally a foil for [[Harlequin]]'s slyness and adroit nature, Clown was a buffoon or bumpkin fool who resembled less a jester than a comical idiot. He was a lower class character dressed in tattered servants' garb.

The now-classical features of the clown character were developed in the early 1800s by [[Joseph Grimaldi]], who played Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], where Grimaldi built the character up into the central figure of the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Neville6&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern circus clown ===
{{main article|Circus clown}}
The [[circus clown]] developed in the 19th century. The modern circus derives from [[Philip Astley]]'s London riding school, which opened in 1768. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences. American comedian [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] became known for his clown role, directly inspired by Grimaldi, in the 1860s.
[[Tom Belling]] senior (1843–1900) developed the "red clown" or "Auguste" (''Dummer August'') character c. 1870, acting as a foil for the more sophisticated "white clown". Belling worked for [[Circus Renz]] in Vienna. Belling's costume became the template for the modern stock character of circus or children's clown, based on a lower class or "hobo" character, with red nose, white makeup around the eyes and mouth, and oversized clothes and shoes. The clown character as developed by the late 19th century is reflected in [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s 1892 opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' ("Clowns").
Belling's ''Auguste'' character was further popularized by [[Nicolai Poliakoff]]'s ''Coco'' in the 1920s to 1930s.

The English word ''clown'' was borrowed, along with the circus clown act, into many other languages, such as French ''clown'', Russian (and other Slavic languages) кло́ун, Greek κλόουν, Danish/Norwegian ''klovn'', Romanian ''clovn'' etc.

Italian retains ''Pagliaccio'', a Commedia dell'arte [[zanni]] character,&lt;ref&gt;From ''paglia'', the word for "straw" (after the straw costume of the rustic buffoon character), or from ''bajaccio'' "mocker, scoffer".&lt;/ref&gt; and derivations of the Italian term are found in other Romance languages, such as French ''Paillasse'', Spanish ''payaso'', Catalan/Galician ''pallasso'', Portuguese ''palhaço'', Greek παλιάτσος, Turkish ''palyaço'',   German ''Pajass'' (via French),&lt;ref&gt;Dialectal [https://digital.idiotikon.ch/idtkn/id4.htm#!page/41099/mode/1up Bajass] in ''[[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yiddish פּאַיאַץ  (''payats''), Russian пая́ц.

=== History in 20th-century North America ===
In the early 20th century, with the disappearance of the rustic simpleton or village idiot character of everyday experience, North American circuses developed characters such as the [[tramp]] or [[hobo]]. Examples include [[Marceline Orbes]], who performed at the [[New York Hippodrome|Hippodrome Theater]](1905), [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Tramp]]'' (1914), and [[Emmett Kelly]]'s ''Weary Willie'' based on hobos of the Depression era. Another influential tramp character was played by [[Otto Griebling]] during the 1930s to 1950s. [[Red Skelton]]'s Dodo the Clown in ''[[The Clown (1953 film)|The Clown]]'' (1953), depicts the circus clown as a tragicomic stock character, "a funny man with a drinking problem".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the United States, [[Bozo the Clown]] was an influential ''Auguste'' character since the late 1950s. ''[[The Bozo Show]]'' premiered in 1960 and appeared nationally on cable television in 1978. [[McDonald's]] derived its mascot clown, [[Ronald McDonald]], from the ''Bozo'' character in the 1960s. [[Willard Scott]], who had played ''Bozo'' during 1959–1962, performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. The McDonald's trademark application for the character dates to 1967.

Based on the ''Bozo'' template, the US custom of birthday clown, private contractors who offer to perform as clowns at children's parties, developed in the 1960s to 1970s. The strong association of the (''Bozo''-derived) clown character with children's entertainment as it has developed since the 1960s also gave rise to "[[Clown Care]]" or "hospital clowning" in children's hospitals by the mid 1980s. [[Clowns of America International]] (established 1984) and [[World Clown Association]] (established 1987) are associations of semi-professionals and professional performers.

The shift of the ''Auguste'' or "red clown" character from his role as a foil for the white in circus or pantomime shows to a ''Bozo''-derived standalone character in children's entertainment by the 1980s also gave rise to the [[evil clown]] character, the attraction of clowns for small children being based in their fundamentally threatening or frightening nature.&lt;ref&gt;A study by the [[University of Sheffield]] concluded "that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable."{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7189401.stm |title=Health &amp;#124; Hospital clown images 'too scary' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2011-07-05 }} {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-01-16|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary?|first=Finlo|last=Rohrer}}.

=== Pierrot and Harlequin ===
:''See [[Harlequinade]]''
The classical pairing of the White Clown with Auguste in modern tradition
has a precedent in the pairing of [[Pierrot]] and [[Harlequin]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
Originally, Harlequin's role was that of a light-hearted, nimble and astute servant, paired with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.

In the 18th-century English [[Harlequinade]], Harlequin was now paired with Clown.
As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such pair in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s.

=== White clown and Auguste ===
{{anchor|Auguste}}
[[File:LES ROSSYANN Weisscloun und dummer August.JPG|thumb|left|Les Rossyann. ''White clown'' and clumsy ''Auguste'' from France.]]

The ''white clown'', or ''clown blanc'' from the original French, is a sophisticated character, as opposed to the clumsy auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter, Joel () [https://books.google.com/books?id=avG5rDz3ENUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 ''Popular Theatre: A Sourcebook''] p.139&lt;/ref&gt; They are also distinguished as the "sad clown" (blanc) and "happy clown" (auguste).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Danièle |last1=Berton |first2=Jean-Pierre |last2=Simard |year=2007 |title=Création théâtrale: Adaptation, schèmes, traduction |language=French}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=q7FLWMA8MiAC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330 p.330]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Auguste face base makeup color is a variation of pink, red, or tan rather than white. Features are exaggerated in size, and are typically red and black in color. The mouth is thickly outlined with white (called the muzzle) as are the eyes. Appropriate to the character, the auguste can be dressed in either well-fitted garb or in a costume that does not fit — either oversize or too small is appropriate. Bold colors, large prints or patterns, and suspenders often characterize Auguste costumes.

The auguste character-type is often an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste has a hard time performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste plays the role of an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.

The ''contra-auguste'' plays the role of the mediator between the white clown and the auguste character. He has a lower status than the white clown but a higher status than the auguste. He aspires to be more like the white clown and often mimics everything the white clown does to try to gain approval. If there is a contra-auguste character, he often is instructed by the whiteface to correct the auguste when he is doing something wrong.

=== Whiteface makeup ===
{{anchor|Whiteface}}
There are two major types of clowns with "whiteface" makeup:
The classic "white clown" is derived from the [[Pierrot]] character. His makeup is white, usually with facial features such as eyebrows emphasized in black. He is the more intelligent and sophisticated clown, contrasting with the rude or grotesque ''Auguste'' types. [[Francesco Caroli]] and [[Glen Little (clown)|Glenn "Frosty" Little]] are examples of this type.  The second type of whiteface is the buffoonish clown of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' type, known as "Comedy" or "Grotesque Whiteface". This type has grotesquely emphasized features, especially a red nose and red mouth, often with partial (mostly red) hair. 
In the comedic partnership of [[Abbott and Costello]], Bud Abbot would have been the classic whiteface and Lou Costello the comedy whiteface or Auguste.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany McCoy, [http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html Clown Types] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026152528/http://new.4-hcurriculum.org/projects/theatre/TheatreArts/Clowning/Clown%20Types.html |date=2015-10-26 }} (2010), citing ''Strutter's Complete Guide to Clown Makeup'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the whiteface clown uses "clown white" makeup to cover the entire face and neck, leaving none of the underlying natural skin visible.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118 /&gt; In the European whiteface makeup, the ears are painted red.

Whiteface makeup was originally designed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] in 1801. He began by painting a white base over his face, neck and chest before adding red triangles on the cheeks, thick eyebrows and large red lips set in a mischievous grin. Grimaldi's design is used by many modern clowns. According to Grimaldi's biographer Andrew McConnell Stott, it was one of the most important theatrical designs of the 1800s.&lt;ref name=MCS117-118&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

America's first great whiteface clown was stage star [[George L. Fox (clown)|George "G.L." Fox]]. Following English [[Joseph Grimaldi]], Fox popularised the Humpty Dumpty stories throughout the land in the first half of the 19th century in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/var1993000449/PP/ "G.L. Fox the original Humpty Dumpty"], Library of Congress (online), accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Character clown ===
The character clown adopts an eccentric character of some type, such as a butcher, a baker, a policeman, a housewife or [[hobo]]. Prime examples of this type of clown are the circus tramps [[Otto Griebling]] and [[Emmett Kelly]]. [[Red Skelton]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] would all fit the definition of a character clown.

The character clown makeup is a comic slant on the standard human face. Their makeup starts with a flesh tone base and may make use of anything from glasses, mustaches and beards to freckles, warts, big ears or strange haircuts.

==== North American ====
The most prevalent character clown in the American circus is the ''hobo'', ''tramp'' or ''bum'' clown. There are subtle differences in the American character clown types. The primary differences among these clown types is [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. According to American circus expert [[Hovey Burgess]], they are :
* The Hobo: Migratory and finds work where he travels. Down on his luck but maintains a positive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]].
* The Tramp: Migratory and does not work where he travels. Down on his [[luck]] and depressed about his situation.
* The Bum: Non-migratory and non-working.

== Clown organizations ==
=== Clowns International ===
Clowns International claims to be the oldest clown society in the world. It was set up in 1946. Apart from being a membership organisation, Clowns International has set up a museum of clown memorabilia and a register of clown make-up. The latter also has a collection of full eggshells decorated as replicas of the specific clown's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Gallery|url=http://www.clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|accessdate=June 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907170445/http://clowns-international.com/index.php/galleries/egg-collection|archivedate=September 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Clown Association ===
{{main article|World Clown Association}}
The World Clown Association (WCA) is a worldwide organization for clowns, jugglers, magicians, and face painters. It holds an annual convention, mainly in the United States.

=== Clowns of America International ===
{{main article|Clowns of America International}}
Clowns of America International, Inc. (COAI) is a Minnesota-based nonprofit clown arts membership organization which aims "to share, educate, and act as a gathering place for serious minded amateurs, semiprofessionals, and professional clowns".

== Clowning terminology ==

=== Other roles and skills ===
In the circus, a clown might perform other circus roles or skills. Clowns may perform such skills as [[tightrope]], [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], [[MC|Master of Ceremonies]], or ride an animal. Clowns may also "sit in" with the [[orchestra]]. Other circus performers may also temporarily stand in for a clown and perform their skills in clown costume.

=== Frameworks ===
'''Frameworks''' are the general outline of an act that clowns use to help them build out an act.&lt;ref name="simplycircus.com"&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=March 13, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313202950/http://simplycircus.com/circus_dictionary/clowning_framework|url=http://www.simplycircus.com/Circus_Dictionary/Clowning_Framework|website=simplycircus.com|title=Clowning Framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks can be loose, including only a general beginning and ending to the act, leaving it up to the clown's creativity to fill in the rest, or at the other extreme a fully developed script that allows very little room for creativity.

'''Shows''' are the overall production that a clown is a part of, it may or may not include elements other than clowning, such as in a circus show. In a circus context, clown shows are typically made up of some combination of Entrées, Side dishes, Clown Stops, Track Gags, Gags and bits.

=== Gags, bits and business ===
* '''Business''' — the individual motions the clown uses, often used to express the clown's character.
* '''Gag''' — very short piece of clown comedy that, when repeated within a "bit" or "routine," may become a ''running gag''. Gags are, loosely, the jokes clowns play on each other. A gag may have a beginning, a middle, and an end — or may not. Gags can also refer to the prop stunts/tricks or the stunts that clowns use, such as a squirting flower.
* '''Bit''' — the clown's sketch or routine, made up of one or more "gags" either worked out and timed before going on stage, or impromptu bits composed of familiar improvisational material.

=== Menu ===
* '''Entrée''' — clowning acts lasting 5–10 minutes. Typically made up of various gags and bits, usually within a clowning framework. Entrées almost always end with a "blow-off" — the comedic ending of a show segment, "bit," "gag," "stunt," or "routine."
* '''Side dish''' — shorter feature act. Side dishes are essentially shorter versions of the "entrée," typically lasting 1–3 minutes. Typically made up of various "gags" and "bits," side dishes are usually within a clowning framework. Side dishes almost always end with a "blow-off."

=== Interludes ===
"Clown Stops" or "interludes" are the brief appearances of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically made up of a few ''gags'' or several ''bits''. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called "reprises" or "run-ins" by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of "business" usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a [[tightrope walker]] the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the ''artiste'' by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.

=== Prop stunts ===
Among the more well-known clown stunts are: squirting flower; the "[[Clown car|too-many-clowns-coming-out-of-a-tiny-car]]" stunt; doing just about anything with a [[rubber chicken]], tripping over one's own feet (or an air pocket or imaginary blemish in the floor), or riding any number of ridiculous vehicles or "[[Clown bicycle|clown bikes]]". Individual prop stunts are generally considered individual bits.

In anthropology, the term "clown" has been extended to comparable jester or fool characters in non-Western cultures. A society in which such "clowns" have an important position are termed "[[clown society|clown societies]]", and a "clown" character involved in a religious or ritual capacity is known as a "[[ritual clown]]".

The most ancient "clowns"  have been found in the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]], around 2400 BC.&lt;ref name="Bala2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bala |first=Michael |date=Winter 2010 |jstor=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |title=The Clown: An Archetypal Self-Journey |journal=[[Jung Journal: Culture &amp; Psyche]] |volume=4 |issue=1 | pages=50–71 |quote=The one who swallows the largest amount of filth with the greatest gusto is most commended by the fraternity and onlookers. |doi=10.1525/jung.2010.4.1.50 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Peter Berger writes that "It seems plausible that folly and fools, like religion and magic, meet some deeply rooted needs in human society".&lt;ref name="BergerP78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1997|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, clowning is often considered an important part of training as a [[physical theatre|physical performance]] discipline, partly because tricky subject matter can be dealt with, but also because it requires a high level of risk and play in the performer.&lt;ref name="CalleryP64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Callery|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Native American mythology, the [[Trickster]] channels the spirit of the Coyote and becomes a sacred Clown character.  A [[Heyoka]] is an individual in Native cultures who lives outside the constraints of normal cultural roles.  The Heyoka plays the role of a backwards clown, doing everything in reverse.  The Heyoka role is sometimes best filled by a [[Winkte]].

Many native tribes have a history of clowning.
The [[Canadian Clowning]] method developed by [[Richard Pochinko]] and furthered by his former apprentice, [[Sue Morrison]], combines European and Native American clowning techniques.

In this tradition, masks are made of clay while the creator's eyes are closed. A mask is made for each direction of the [[medicine wheel]]. During this process, the clown creates a personal mythology that explores their personal experiences.

A '''Cornelian dilemma''' (''dilemme cornélien'') (spelled in translation with two "l"'s i.e. "Corneillian") is a [[dilemma]] for someone to oblige and choose from each options, revealing a detrimental effect on anyone. It involves the character experiencing an inner conflict, forcing them to choose between [[love]] with [[honour]] or [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] with [[duty]]. It is introduced in ''[[Le Cid]]''.

{{nihongo|'''''Devilman'''''|デビルマン|Debiruman|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Go Nagai]], which originally started as an [[anime]] adaptation of the concept of Nagai's previous manga series, ''[[Demon Lord Dante]]''. This 39-episode anime series was developed by [[Toei Animation]] in 1972, while Nagai began the ''Devilman'' as a manga in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Weekly Shōnen Magazine]]'', barely a month before the anime series started. The series has since spawned numerous [[OVA]]s, manga, novels, and films.

Devilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. The most notable is [[Tomoharu Katsumata]]'s 1973 feature film ''[[Mazinger Z vs. Devilman]]'', which features Devilman teaming up with Nagai's titular robot to fight Dr. Hell.

==Plot==
Akira Fudo is a timid teenage boy who lives with Miki Makimura and her family after his parents died on a trip to the [[Arctic]]. One day, Akira's best friend, Ryo Asuka, asks for help when his archaeologist father died after uncovering a mask during an excavation of ancient Mayan ruins, confirming the existence of ancient apex predators that assimilate other lifeforms to evolve: [[demon]]s. The mask is revealed to be a fossilized demon skull that shows the wearer the world as it was many millennia ago when demons roam the Earth. Ryo's plan is to prevent the revival of demons: "To fight a demon, one must become a demon."

Ryo believes that people like Akira with a pure heart may be able to harness a demon's powers without being consumed and Akira agrees to help after they encounter demons in Ryo's house. Ryo takes his friend to a nightclub in his father’s basement then picks a fight and draws blood to attract demonic attention. Demons begin to possess the clubbers and threaten Ryo and Akira, until a powerful demon known as Amon – the Lord of War, also called the Beast of Hell – consumes Akira. But Akira manages to retain his sense of self while possessing some Amon's personality traits and power as he becomes known as Devilman. Throughout the series, Devilman has many battles with the demon hordes, encountering foes such as Amon's harpy-like lover Sirène, the water demon Geruma, and a large turtle-demon Jinmen who incorporates the souls of his victims into his shell.

Eventually, the demons start a [[world war]] with humanity which causes mass panic and paranoia across the planet with mankind turning on itself. Akira starts to gather other Devilmen like him to fight the demons, only to be betrayed by when Ryo exposed him to the public which resulted in Miki's parents arrested by the government while she and her brother were violently murdered by a mob which Akira slaughtered in retribution. It was then that Ryo reveals himself as the reincarnation of the fallen angel [[Satan]], having unconsciously orchestrated his true plan while exploiting humanity's flaws and fell in love with Akira as he arranged his transition into Devilman. With no one left to protect, Akira ends his friendship with Satan as they eventually settle things in an epic battle lasting twenty years after humanity is extinct.

During the final battle, Satan reveals to Akira that the demons were unintentionally created by God and that he defied the order to kill them out of deeming that they have a right to live. Satan convinced the demons to enter a state of [[hibernation]] in the ice to conserve their strength for the final battle with God, awakening to find Earth ravaged by humanity which he resolved to exterminate first. It was then that Satan realizes his actions made him and the demons were no better than God, learning too late that he already killed Akira when asking for his forgiveness. The series ends with the Devilman army defeated, which Satan weeping for the loss off his dearest love as an army of [[angel]]s appear in the distance to wipe out the remains of Satan's army.

==Production==
''Devilman'' evolved from Go Nagai's previous manga, ''[[Demon Lord Dante]]'', after [[Toei Animation]] approached Nagai about turning ''Dante'' into a television series. The producers wanted certain elements toned down, and a more human-like anti-hero created. ''Devilman'' was born as a result of this.&lt;ref name="Devilman Revelations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Devilman Revelations|url=http://devilworld.org/revelations.html |publisher=devilworld.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060620081843/http://devilworld.org/revelations.html |archivedate = 2006-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Go Nagai worked on the anime's scenario along with renowned screenwriter and science-fiction novelist [[Masaki Tsuji]], who wrote the scripts for 35 of the TV series' 39 episodes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Along with the television series, ''Devilman'' was also produced as a serialized manga in ''[[Shōnen Magazine]]'' beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name="Go Nagai works list 1971-1975 - ebookjapan"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ebookjapan.jp/ebj/nagaigo/works_02.asp|title=Go Nagai works list 1971–1975| accessdate=2009-08-02|work=Nagai Go Special Corner|publisher=eBOOK Initiative Japan| location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Go Nagai designed the manga to be more horror-like and mature than the anime version.&lt;ref name="Devilman Revelations"/&gt; 

Nagai designed ''Devilman'' as an anti-war work; the fusion of humans and demons is an analogy for the draft, and Miki's violent death parallels the death of peace. "There is no justice in war, any war," wrote Nagai, "nor is there any justification for human beings killing one another. ''Devilman'' carries a message of warning, as we step toward a bright future."&lt;ref name="Devilman Revelations"/&gt;

The manga is sometimes known as ''Devilman 2'' and ''Neo Devilman''.&lt;ref name="Shin Devilman - d/visual" /&gt;

Both were directed by Umanosuke Iida (credited under his birth name, Tsutomu Iida) and were closely developed in conjunction with Nagai himself. The OVAs' plot revolves around Akira's transformation into Devilman up until his battle with Sirène. Besides a few minor alterations, the OVAs are faithful to the original manga.  Both OVAs were released on [[Laserdisc]] and on a single DVD by Bandai Visual in {{Start date|2003|03|28}}.&lt;ref name="Devilman OVA Collection - bandaivisual.co.jp "&gt;{{cite web|url= http://product.bandaivisual.co.jp/web_service/shop_product_info.asp?item_no=BCBA-1570|title       = Devilman OVA Collection (Digital Beat – Work detail)|accessdate=2009-08-03|publisher= Bandai Visual|location=Japan|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two OVAs were also the only ''Devilman'' anime to have been commercially released in the United States (by [[Manga Entertainment]]) prior to 2014. The DVD release included only the English-dubbed version (the original Japanese version was previously released on VHS in 1995 by L.A. Hero and Dark Image Entertainment).

In 2000, ''[[Amon: The Darkside of The Devilman|Amon: Apocalypse of Devilman]]'' was released as a pay-per-view event in Japan and was later released on video and DVD.  It covers the period between the humans becoming aware of demons and the semi-final battle between Devilman and Amon.  The battle between Devilman and Satan does not occur in this OVA.

In 2015, ''[[Cyborg 009 VS Devilman]]'' was released. The 3-episode OVA features Devilman battling the cast of [[Shotaro Ishinomori]]'s ''[[Cyborg 009]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-07-13/cyborg-009-vs-devilman-anime-reveals-main-devilman-cast/.90381 |title=Cyborg 009 Vs.

''[[Mazinger Z Vs. Devilman]]'' is a crossover animated film between ''Devilman'' and ''[[Mazinger Z]]'' produced by Toei and released in {{start date|1973|07|18}}. The movie features alternative versions of the events from both series, and is therefore not canonical to either one.

In {{start date|2004|10|09}}, a live-action [[tokusatsu]] film directed by [[Hiroyuki Nasu]] was theatrically released in Japan.&lt;ref name="Devilman film - allcinema"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=319020|title=Devilman film|accessdate=2010-10-30|publisher=AllCinema|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred Hisato Izaki as Devilman, Yūsuke Izaki as Ryo Asuka and Ayana Sakai as Miki Makimura.

Three novels have been released. The first one {{nihongo|''Shin Devilman''|真・デビルマン|Shin Debiruman}} was written by Go Nagai's brother [[Yasutaka Nagai]] with illustrations by Go. It was originally published in 1981 by [[Asahi Sonorama]] in four books.&lt;ref name="Devilman variation novels - Viva!

With the release of the first OVA, in 1987 a single volume novel based on it was released by Kodansha titled {{nihongo|''Shin Video Shosetsu – Devilman: Tanjo Hen''|新ビデオ小説 デビルマン 誕生編|shin bideo shousetsu debiruman tanjou hen}}.  It was also written by Yasutaka Nagai, but it had illustrations by the OVA's main designer, Kazuo Komatsubara.  In 1999 a second novelization of 4 volumes titled {{nihongo|''Devilman: The Novel''|デビルマン The Novel}} was published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] and once again written by Yasutaka and illustrated by Go.&lt;ref name="Devilman variation novels - Viva!

Devilman and other characters from the series have shown up in cameo appearances numerous times in Go Nagai's other works. Miki is the first female protagonist of the 1974 manga ''[[Oira Sukeban]]'', and Akira has appeared in various incarnations of ''[[Cutie Honey]]'', most notably the 1994 OVA ''[[New Cutie Honey]]''. Miki and Ryo Asuka also appear as dogs (with dog-like bodies and human heads) in the ''[[Violence Jack]]'' manga. In 1997, Nagai created ''[[Devil Lady]]'', based on his idea of if the main character was a woman. The ''Devil Lady'' series contains its own original story that stands out from the ''Devilman'' series. Fudo's silhouette briefly appears in the opening credits of ''Devil Lady''. The cast of ''Devilman'' also crossed over with characters from ''Mazinger Z'' and ''Violence Jack'' in the 1991 OVA ''[[CB Chara Nagai Go World]]''. This release featured the familiar characters in comical and lighthearted antics in [[super deformed]] forms. In this series, it is revealed that Violence Jack is a future version of Akira Fudo. It is also revealed that Miki is an [[otaku]] and that she knew of Akira's identity as Devilman due to reading the manga offscreen.

Go Nagai created the manga ''Devilman Saga'' (デビルマンサーガ) in 2014 which is said to conclude the Devilman trilogy. It is published in Shogakukan's ''Big Comic''.The story takes place in the year 2025, a [[roboticist]] named Fudou Yuuki joins a project involving a large mural depicting humanity's true past as well as the ancient but advanced technology found in Antarctica.

The manga has sold over 50 million copies as of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hobby.dengeki.com/news/355688/|script-title=ja:永井豪原作の漫画『デビルマン』を湯浅監督が新作アニメとして映像化！ティザービジュアル＆特報解禁!! | date=March 16, 2017 |publisher=[[Dengeki]]|language=Japanese |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The storyline in ''Devilman'' made it stand apart from other manga of the time. However, its controversial violence made it a major target of protest for the [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://menofcomics.com/anime/masaaki-yuasas-devilman-project-officially-titled-devilman-crybaby-premieres-netflix-2018/|title=Masaaki Yuasa's Devilman project is officially titled Devilman Crybaby|last=|first=|date=|website=Men of Comics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Go Nagai is said to have been highly shocked that his giant-robot work ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', which was on Japanese TV at the same time as ''Devilman'' and which he originally did not take very seriously, surpassed ''Devilman'' in popularity. The reason was that he had worked especially hard on ''Devilman'' and only made ''Mazinger'' as a way to blow off steam.

Devilman was ranked fifth in Mania Entertainment's 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth who commented that "Shonen manga developed a dark tone with Devilman's graphic violence, casual blasphemy, and theme of using evil itself to fight evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/10-iconic-anime-heroes_article_119883.html |title=10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes |last=Zoth |first=Thomas |date=January 12, 2010 |publisher=Mania Entertainment |accessdate=January 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017063118/http://www.mania.com/10-iconic-anime-heroes_article_119883.html |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A character designer from [[SNK]] admitted that ''Devilman'' was an influence in designing [[Kyo Kusanagi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shmuplations.com/kof94/|title=King of Fighters ’94 – Developer Interview|publisher=Shmuplations|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Huff of The Anime Review Notes "a couple of enjoyable bits" in the OVA adaptation, yet ultimately recommends Vampire Hunter D instead "if you want to see a splatterfest of grotesque monsters getting all gooey and split in two", &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanimereview.com/reviews/devilman.html |title=Devilman |publisher=''[[TheAnimeReview]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements of [[The Anime Encyclopedia]] said that the series was brought down by "the messy confluence of Japanese and European mythology". Though comments about the series and statements making incorrect claims on the series, make it seem as if they never read it.&lt;ref&gt;The Anime Encyclopedia, Page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15076">A '''dialect coach''' is an acting [[coaching|coach]] who helps an actor design the voice and speech of a character in the context of an on-camera (film, television or commercial), stage (theatre, musical theatre, opera, etc.), radio or animation [[voiceover]] production. The dialect coach often does original research on dialects and speech patterns, prepares training materials, provides instruction and works on lines with the actor. A dialect coach will give the actor feedback focusing on issues of credibility, consistency, and clarity. A dialect coach may also be employed to help comedians hone impressions of celebrities, to train non-actor public speakers in vocal character and delivery, or to help singers improve in diction and attain a balance between tone and articulation, especially when singing in a second language.

==Terminology==

The term ''dialect coach'' persists as the primary designation for an accent or language coach in the US and Canadian entertainment businesses. However, other designations may also be used. Some dialect coaches will refer to themselves as ''dialogue coaches'' (or, occasionally, by the historical designation, ''dialogue directors''), especially when working on a second language or when offering acting coaching on straight dialogue in the performer's own language or dialect.

In the [[opera]] world, coaches who help opera singers with articulation of lyrics (often in an unfamiliar language, such as Russian, German or Czech) are called ''diction coaches.'' In the United Kingdom, dialect coaches are generally called ''accent coaches'' and are not [[acting coach]]es.

The term ''[[vocal coach|voice coach]]'' is applied to those who work with breathing, voice and text in the theatre in the UK, though this usage is not common in the US film and television businesses where the term "voice coach" would generally be understood to refer to a singing coach (a.k.a., a ''[[vocal coach]]'').

Likewise, on US stage productions the term ''voice coach'' is also avoided to prevent confusion with either a vocal (singing) coach or someone who coaches actors in techniques for inducing a state of heightened relaxation prior to a rehearsal or performance, and who may offer guidance on breath support or vocal practices intended to promote effective placement of resonances in the upper body, the actor's availability of expression and appropriate projection.&lt;ref name="Fitzmaurice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodenburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linklater" /&gt;

==Activities==
In some cases, voice warm-up coaching integrates full-body work in [[yoga]], movement or balance. Many actors believe that such warm-ups and exercises reduce the likelihood of vocal damage, most especially during expression of high intensity emotion outdoors or in a large performing venue in the absence of electronic amplification (e.g., microphones and a PA system).&lt;ref name="claims" /&gt; A dialect coach may also be engaged to coach voice issues in this latter sense in conjunction with theatrical dialect coaching. Not every dialect coach has the training and knowledge to also do vocal coaching in a singing sense.

==Hiring and management==

===On-camera productions===
On a film or television production, dialect coaches are typically hired by the [[line producer]] during pre-production to begin preparing cast far in advance of the first day of [[principal photography]]. If engaged during principal photography, it is the [[unit production manager]], [[production manager]], [[production supervisor]], [[production coordinator]] or, in some cases, [[executive producer]] who is likely to interview prospective coaches in behalf of the production. If engaged only during post-production, the coach may even be hired directly by the post producer. In advance of being hired, coaches may be interviewed by the [[showrunner]] or a staff writer in the case of episodic television or by the [[film director]] in the case of a feature film. Dialect coaches may work with any members of the cast, but are brought in especially often to work with celebrity actors who have been cast in roles which require accents other than their own or even the performance of dialogue in languages unknown to the actors. Therefore, frequently, the actors themselves will ask Production to hire a particular coach. 

However the coach comes to be hired, the creatives will often consult with the dialect coach early in the process in order to acquaint the dialect coach with the overall creative vision and to start the actor as early as possible to allow time for the character's voice to become fully integrated by the actor prior to the actor's first shoot day. Once hired, the coach will typically prepare actors over a number of sessions either remotely, on set, at the Production Office or in the actor's own home. Coaches who work in serialized television are expected to be especially flexible as there may be no opportunity for a meeting between the episode director and coach, as shooting scripts may not be finalized until very close to the day of the shoot and as last-minute casting decisions and limitations on actor-availability may make it difficult to schedule advance coaching.

During production, the [[key second assistant director]] typically schedules coaching sessions. Many creatives will ask that the coach be present at read-throughs or story conferences, at production meetings (if serving as key coach) and during at least some first-team rehearsals. While a shot is set-up, the coach will be kept in close proximity to the actors to be coached. Often, the coach will be assigned a dressing room, or, on location, a room in the honeywagon, double-banger or triple-banger near the actors' trailers. On set, the dialect coach will be issued a wireless headset and given a chair (exclusive, if on set regularly) in video village in order to facilitate access to the director and to the script supervisor who may be asked by the coach to relay notes on pronunciation and clarity, particularly if the dialogue is in dialect or language unfamiliar to the post-production team. An on-set coach may also work with an actor between takes if needed, especially on last minute changes to the script. Later, the coach may be brought back for dubbing or to pick up new lines during the post-production process, sometimes via a feed from a remote studio when the actors are no-longer available in person.&lt;ref name="Blaise" /&gt;

===Stage productions===
On a stage production, dialect coaches are typically brought in by a director or artistic director with contractual terms negotiated by a producer or general manager. Coaches work closely with the production stage manager who coordinates meetings with the director and coaching sessions for the cast collectively or individually. The coach will often also be present to give notes to the actors at some rehearsals, partial runs and full runs. Coaching typically takes place throughout the rehearsal process, but especially before the actors begin memorizing their lines and again after the show is loaded into the performance space. Understudies may be coached alongside the principal performers or after the show goes into previews. Coaching may continue in a limited way during a run.

==Status and compensation==
In the film and television businesses, dialect coaches are very well paid. Coaches are customarily given on-screen credits for their work on films and for substantial contributions to serialized television. The wording of the credit may vary with the specific requirements of the production. On some shows, dialect coaches may be asked to contribute intellectual property to the production in the form of, for instance, dialogue polishing in English or other languages. They may serve as technical consultants in the areas of culture and written language. They often guide, or engage with, the cast's process of creating a character and consult on the overall vocal design for the production. Consequently, the deal memos for coaches may include compensation terms that are not typical for crew positions, leading to the adage that dialect coaches are neither [[above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] nor [[below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]], but on-the-line.

In the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK and the US, dialect coaches remain among a very small minority of production staff who are not unionized; their deals may differ in substance from production to production in these jurisdictions. In Australia and New Zealand, dialect coaches who are employed on a film or theatre set are covered under the [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]]. On English-language Canadian film and television productions, dialect coaches are unionized under the [[Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists]]. Coaches are not unionized under the [[Union des artistes]] for French-language productions in Canada.

In the theater, coaches who help actors hone dialects or character voices typically seek compensation on a par with designers and may be credited as dialect coaches, dialect designers or voice and speech directors. Dialect coaches are not unionized for live performances in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK or the US. 

There is no membership branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] that incorporates dialect coaching, nor is there a peer group of the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] that accords active membership status to coaches.

==Cost-cutting for low-budget productions==
Due to budget constraints, producers of student films and stage plays, showcase theater and slimly financed independent films and web series may avoid hiring a dialect coach, and instead substitute the services of a low-paid or volunteer native speaker model in hopes that the actors will be able to learn mimetically, retain the accent and act in it without expert guidance or monitoring. In some such cases, cast members may themselves pay a coach, sometimes in consultation with the director, though employing crew is not normally regarded as a cast member’s responsibility. In other cases, actors may attempt to self-study the dialect using commercially available training materials or web-based voice archives&lt;ref name="IDEA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VADA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCVoices" /&gt; which host native-speaker recordings of oral histories or interviews or other scripted speech.&lt;ref name="SAA" /&gt; The majority of such archives also provide native-speaker recordings of phonemically balanced narrative passages, especially ''Comma Gets a Cure,''&lt;ref name="Comma" /&gt; which is structured around the [[lexical sets]] of English and other phonological patterns of potential interest to the student of dialect.&lt;ref name="VSR" /&gt;

==Job prospects==
While there are many hundreds of voice and speech trainers connected with drama courses throughout the English-speaking world who may control a stock of ''stage dialects'' for general use, far fewer specialize in dialect coaching. A web search of dialect coaches with [[Internet Movie Database]] listings produces fewer than 100 living film and TV coaches worldwide, the majority showing few recent jobs, credited or uncredited. Most of these dialect coaches work on an ad hoc basis on individual productions. However, in some cases, a coach may become attached to a theatre company as a resident voice and speech director, especially if the coach has a second specialization (esp. [[Shakespeare]] or voice). As with many aspects of the entertainment business, entry into the field of dialect coaching is very competitive. Because dialect coaches are not always called for every day of a shoot, many coaches find a way to supplement income while maintaining their availability for coaching, often by acting, directing (including animation voice directing), teaching in related areas (public speaking, etc.) or taking on private students, especially for auditions.&lt;ref name="Kopf" /&gt; Outside of the entertainment businesses based in English-speaking countries, dialect coaching is less common, and opportunities rarer.

==Professional societies==
Dialect coaches, especially those who teach in theater education programs, may become active in such professional societies as the Australian Voice Association, the British Voice Association, the International Centre for Voice and the Voice and Speech Trainers Association.

'''''Digimon''''' ({{lang|ja|デジモン}} ''Dejimon'', branded as '''''Digimon: Digital Monsters''''', stylized as '''''DIGIMON'''''), short for "Digital Monsters" ({{lang|ja|デジタルモンスター}} ''Dejitaru Monsutā''), is a [[Japan]]ese [[media franchise]] encompassing [[digital pet|virtual pet]] toys, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[video game]]s, [[film]]s and a [[trading card game]]. The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a "[[Virtual world|Digital World]]", a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various communication networks.

The franchise was first created in 1997 as a [[Digital Monster (virtual pet)|series of virtual pets]], akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary [[Tamagotchi]] or nano [[Giga Pet]] toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American [[comics]]. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', and an early video game, ''[[Digimon World]]'', both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and [[List of Digimon video games|the video game series]] has expanded into genres such as [[role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[racing game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]]. Other media forms have also been released.

==Eponymous creatures==
Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called {{nihongo|Digi-Eggs|デジタマ|Dejitama}}. In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of [[Digi-Eggs|Digi-Egg]] that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a {{nihongo|Digimental|デジメンタル|Dejimentaru}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. They age via a process called "Digivolution" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. A further level has since been used in the video games, even higher than Mega, known as ''Ultra'' in the dub.

===Television series===

The ''Digimon'' [[anime]] series was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. Beginning in 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the ''Digimon'' [[Film|movies]] aired in [[theaters]] in Japan. Originally, the ''Digimon Adventure'' movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for ''Digimon'' becoming a children's television show was made, which later became the basis for ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''. Several more series would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies. The series was dubbed for release in Western markets, with the first four series under the title ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.

===Distribution and localization===

In the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. It was dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), and was initially broadcast through [[Fox Kids]]. The first four series were collectively retitled ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters Episode Guide|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010615125822/http://www.foxkids.com:80/tvshows/digimon/episode1.html|archivedate=2001-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's [[standards and practices]]. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw ''Digi-Bowl'' specials co-produced with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]; ''NFL on Fox'' commentator [[Terry Bradshaw]] provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkids.com/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|title=Digimon: Digital Monsters: Digibowl 2002|work=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Family Properties]]|accessdate=2018-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020123021428/http://www.foxkids.com:80/tvshows/digimon/digibowl/|archivedate=2002-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired Saban during ''[[Digimon Tamers|Digimon: Digital Monsters (Season 3)]]'', the first three series moved to the [[cable network]] [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]], while the fourth (''Frontier'') premiered on [[UPN]] due to a deal between Disney and UPN.&lt;ref name="erickson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003, Volume 1|last1=Erickson|first1=Hal|authorlink1=Hal Erickson (author)|year=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=|isbn=978-0786420995 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UPN]] aired the show until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney.&lt;ref name="erickson"/&gt; ''Frontier'' aired on ABC Family concurrently, and reran (alongside the first three seasons) on that channel and [[Toon Disney]] (for the latter under the [[Jetix]] branding) for several years after. ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' also had a brief run on Toon Disney/Jetix and successor [[Disney XD]]. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Xros Wars]]''. [[Funimation Entertainment]] has online streaming rights to subtitled versions of ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''.

In September 2012, [[Saban Brands]] announced it had re-acquired the ''Digimon'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Deborah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Brand|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/sep/25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Business Journal|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Franchise|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-09-25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-franchise|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=AnimeNewsNetwork|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sarah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Brand|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=BSCKids|date=September 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234026/http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|archivedate=September 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Saban acquired ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' for broadcast on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States starting September 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/100265 |title=Nickelodeon dives into Digimon &amp;#124; News |publisher=C21Media |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416084142/http://www.c21media.net/archives/100265 |archivedate=2013-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three episodes, the show was moved to [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] starting October 13, 2013.

''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' and its two sequels, ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'', were added to the [[Netflix]] Instant Streaming service in 2013 and 2014 with Japanese audio and English subtitles. [[Crunchyroll]] began streaming the English-subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'' outside Japan in November 2011. The English-localized version of its first season became available on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, followed by the second season on March 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-02/crunchyroll-to-stream-digimon-xros-wars-anime|title=Crunchyroll to Stream Digimon Xros Wars Anime|work=Anime News Network|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the subtitled versions, the dubbed versions of ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'', and ''Tamers'' were briefly removed from Netflix.

In Canada, the English versions were broadcast on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], but only the first 26 episodes of ''Digimon Fusion'' were shown. The dubbed version of ''Data Squad'' aired on [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]]. In the United Kingdom, ''Digimon: Digital Monsters'' first aired in the UK on subscription cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] but gained most popularity on terrestrial channel [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s children's slot [[CITV]] from 2001-2002, which broadcast ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' and a small amount of ''Tamers'' airing during after school hours. The entirety of ''Tamers'' aired on cable/satellite channel [[Disney XD (UK and Ireland)|Fox Kids]] from 2002–04. ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' was originally announced on Jetix but was later dropped. The series eventually saw a release on October 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://mailchi.mp/30f437a59d09/aw-slate&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2011, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'' (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on [[Kix!]] (the show's sole provider). According to Fox Kids's (2000–03) and Kix's (2010-) [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] Television ratings, ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' &amp; ''Tamers'' have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewing Data Top 10s|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-10?|publisher=BARB (Broadcasters' Audience Research Board)|accessdate=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by [[ITV Studios#ITV Studios Global Entertainment|ITV Studios Global Entertainment]], Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on Digital Terrestrial Channel, [[CITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Michelle|title=ITV to broadcast Digimon Fusion anime in 2014|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/2013101730346/itv-to-broadcast-digimon-fusion-anime-in-2014.html|publisher=Rapid TV News|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Jeremy|title=ITV licenses Digimon Fusion|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/10/18/itv-licenses-digimon-fusion/|publisher=Kidsscreen|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manga==
Digimon first appeared in [[narrative]] form in the [[One shot (comic)|one-shot]] manga ''[[C'mon Digimon]]'', released in the summer of 1997. ''C'mon Digimon'' spawned the popular ''[[Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01]]'' manga, written by Hiroshi Izawa, which began serialization on November 21, 1998.

===Yuen Wong Yu manhua===
A Chinese [[manhua]] was written and drawn by [[Yuen Wong Yu]] (余 遠鍠 ''Yu Yuen-wong''), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers ''Digimon Adventure'' in five volumes, ''Digimon Adventure 02'' in two, ''Digimon Tamers'' in four, and ''Digimon Frontier'' in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by [[Rightman Publishing|Rightman Publishing Ltd.]] in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote ''[[D-Cyber]]''.

Two English versions were also released. The first one was published by [[Chuang Yi]] in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by [[Lianne Sentar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liannesentar.com/works/ |title=Lianne Sentar's Other Published Works/Works List |publisher=Liannesentar.com |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by [[TOKYOPOP]] in [[North America]].&lt;br&gt;The three volumes for ''Digimon Frontier'' have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of ''Digimon Frontier'' were distributed by [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australia.

===Dark Horse===
{{main|Digimon: Digital Monsters (comics)}}
[[Dark Horse Comics]] published American-style Digimon [[comic book]]s, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of ''Digimon Adventure'' in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Horn | first = Daniel |author2=Ryan Hill | others = illustrated by Daniel Horn, Cara L.

===Panini===
The Italian publishing company, [[Panini Comics|Panini]], approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.

In February 2010, a website for the online multiplayer game, ''[[Digimon Battle Online]]'', was launched, showing it to be based primarily in the world of the Tamers saga and its characters.&lt;ref name="wemade1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digimonbattle.wemade.net/main/main.asp |title=Digimon Battle- The Journey Begins.

On September 22, 2011, online game publisher [[Joymax]] announced the release of an [[MMORPG]] game called ''[[Digimon Masters]]'', which was developed by the Korean publisher [[Digitalic|DIGITALIC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.mmosite.com/db0f8c32475df80ffc5efceb8939447c/blog/ritem/48fec1a38a4f6162b0b3379b3775c8f1.html |title=Digimon Masters OBT Sept 27th - iMMOsite get your gaming life recorded |publisher=my.mmosite.com |date=2011-09-22 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bandai posted a countdown on a teaser site. Once the countdown was finished, it revealed a reboot of the Digimon World series titled ''[[Digimon World Re:Digitize]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Sal|title=Digimon World Re: Digitize a "return to origins"|url=http://gematsu.com/2011/07/digimon-world-re-digitize-a-return-to-origins|accessdate=7 August 2014|agency=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enhanced version of the game released on [[Nintendo 3DS]] as ''Digimon World Re:Digitize Decode'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Sal|title=Digimon World Re: Digitize Decode announced for 3DS|url=http://gematsu.com/2013/02/digimon-world-re-digitize-decode-announced-for-3ds|accessdate=7 August 2014|agency=Gematsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Card game==
The Digimon Collectible Card Game is a card game based on Digimon, first introduced in Japan in 1997 and published by Bandai. The third season (''[[Digimon Tamers]]'') utilized this aspect of the franchise by making the card game an integral part of the season. Versions of the card game are also included in some of the Digimon video games including ''Digital Card Battle'' and ''[[Digimon World 3]]''.

'''E!''' is a European [[television channel]], operated by E! Entertainment Europe B.V. and owned by [[NBCUniversal]]. It features entertainment-related programming, reality television and Hollywood gossip and news. E! currently has an audience reach of 600 million homes internationally.

== History ==
E! Entertainment Television was founded by [[Larry Namer]] and [[Alan Mruvka]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="BOOK1"&gt;{{cite book

The network launched on 31 July 1987 as '''Movietime''', a service that aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national [[barker channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DD173CF930A35755C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= | work=The New York Times | first=Jeremy | last=Gerard | title=TELEVISION; Fledgling Cable Networks Are Poised for Flight | date=3 June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in June 1990, Movietime was renamed '''E! Entertainment Television''' to emphasise its widening coverage of the [[celebrity-industrial complex]], contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.

In the Fall of 1999, Zone Vision launched E! Entertainment in Poland, under a licensing agreement on the Polish digital platform Wizja TV, with Zone's Studio Company providing localized content.  &lt;ref&gt; http://www.thefreelibrary.com/@Entertainment+Adds+E!+to+The+Wizja+TV+Programming+Platform+Number+of...-a054335858&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was shut down by 2002.
In 2002 E! launched in Europe with its headquarters situated in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. One of the first countries E! broadcast in was Germany, where it telecast daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a9688/e-entertainment-launches-on-sky.html|title=E!

==History==
The Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was created by two separate projects, one dating to 1945 and the other to 1954.&lt;ref name="examenapium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examenapium.it/STUDI/Dizionari/damico.htm|title=Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, 11 voll. fondata da Silvio D'Amico  Roma: Le Maschere, 1954-1968|work=examenapium.it|language=Italian|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early version===
Starting in 1945 or 1946, D'Amico conceived of a project to develop an encyclopedia of the performing arts. Undertaken by an editorial team composed of a few people and led by D'Amico, it was produced in three or four years and contained four volumes. Considered superficial, it was not publishable. However, it developed a model for scientific study of the theater and other performing arts.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Later version===
Conceived as a set of 12 volumes, the second project took on an ethnographic approach.  It had the advantage of a stable editorial group and used foreign employees. D'Amico's editorial staff worked at the [[Palazzo Doria Pamphili]], [[Via del Plebiscito]] 112.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; The attorney [[Carlo Minù]], D'Amico's brother-in-law, found funding for the second project and referred D'Amico to publishers.&lt;ref name="unile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siba3.unile.it/ctle/damico/conversazione.htm|title=Conversazione sull'Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo con Alessandro D'Amico e Luigi Squarzina|work=unile.it|language=Italian|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drawing up lists of [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[ballets]] and [[films]], the editorial team wondered if it their work was worthwhile or helpful.  It was [[Francesco Savio]] who sometimes said, "Of course it is; if someone else wants one day to create an Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, they would find this materials to be useful." When the news spread that the encyclopedia was about to be published, a delegation arrived wanting guidance in the organizational work to start up an encyclopedia of [[Prague]] theater.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

The structure of the work was better articulated. Responsibility for each section, such as film, music, or theater, was delegated to an initial small staff that rapidly grew to thirty editors that coordinated over five hundred employees.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; Large blocks of work were assigned to collaborators, many of them in foreign countries.

D'Amico felt that the second project benefited from finding amateur collectors without whose assistance entire sectors of biographical entries would have been less detailed. Collected material came from abroad or was bought directly in the antique market. An example of a collector was [[Ulderico Rolandi]], a gynecologist who lived in the [[Via Veneto]], and who had made a hobby of collecting, filing and examining [[libretto]]s. He had accumulated what was thought to be the largest collection of opera librettos after the [[Library of Congress]]. Another example was [[David Turcotte]] who had developed a catalog of American cinema.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The project suffered a severe crisis in 1957, two years after the death of D'Amico, due to disagreements between the editorial office and the publisher. The publisher's expectation was to publish two volumes a year, but the editorial staff was only able to put out a single volume each year. Because of this crisis, there is an imbalance between the first volume and the last four whose detail is considered sometimes less accurate.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Editions===
Published between 1954 and 1962, the original nine volume ''Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo'' covers ballet, films, opera, plays, theater, [[vaudeville]], and other areas of entertainment. They include signed essays that discuss performers, directors, and writers. Other sections discuss genres and themes, as well as history, technical subjects, and bibliographies.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |title=Selected Dictionaries and Encyclopedias for Theater |publisher=Yale University Library |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621091137/http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia is over 18,000 pages in length and profusely illustrated with thousands of illustrations of which 700 are in the text, 1800 are out of the text, and there are 320 color plates. The first print run of 10,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 5,000 additional copies. Originally published in Rome by Casa Editrice Le Maschere, reprints were published by UNEDI.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1966, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Aggiornamento 1955-1965'' ("Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, Supplementary 1955-1965) is an update of the main set.  The Aggiornamento addresses developments and biographies.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1968, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Indice-repertorio'' (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts. Index-Directory) is a title index of the 145,000 entries cited in the main set and the supplements.  It addresses author, genre and year of composition.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

==Personnel and management==
D'Amico conceived of the project and brought it to fruition.  The theater section was under the direction of [[Luigi Squarzina]]; he also did the film section.  D'Amico's father worked on the drama theatre section, while his brother Mario worked on the music section. [[Gabriele Baldini]] and later [[Gian Luigi Rondi]] were responsible for the cinema section. Additional sections were led by others including:  [[classical antiquity]] by [[Bruno Gentili]], German theater by [[Paolo Chiarini]], Slavic theater by [[Angelo Maria Ripellino]], English theater by Brunacci, French theater by [[Gian Carlo Roscioni]], Iberian theater by [[Luciana Stegagno Picchio]], and Italian theater by [[Niccolò Gallo]], [[Giulio Cesare Castello]], and [[Caesar Garboli]]. The [[Chamber music]] section was under the direction of D'Amico's son, [[Fedele D'Amico]], a [[Musicology|musicologist]], with [[Nino Pirrotta]], [[Franco Serpa]] and [[Emilia Zanetti]] as editors.

Consultants included [[Sabatino Moscati]] for Hebrew and [[Yiddish theater]]; [[Dario Puccini]] for the [[Iberian language]] theater; [[Luigi Salvini]] for Slavic, [[Finno-Ugric]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian language theater]]; [[Giuliano Bertuccioli]] for [[Chinese theater|Chinese language theater]]. Almost all of the drawings were made by young, recent graduates. Some of the illustrations were edited by [[Helen Poveledo]]. Texts and drafts were reviewed by professors.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

==Critical and popular assessments==
Most libraries found it to be an essential component of their reference section.

The proposed biographies of many lesser figures were not included as the editorial staff were unable to keep up with the publisher's deadline.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

Criticisms of the encyclopedia have included the fact that it was only available in the Italian language, that it was [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], and that non-European theater and 20th century theater were underrepresented. While the encyclopedia was first published in the 1950s, it was based on pre-[[World War II]] documentation. By the 1970s, the ''Encyclopedia of Performing Arts'' was considered out of date.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

[[File:Behn Love-Letters 1684.jpg|thumb|200px|Titlepage of [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister|Love-Letters]]'' (1684)]]

An '''epistolary novel''' &lt;!---or the original [[German language|German]] '''Briefroman'''---&gt; is a [[novel]] written as a series of documents. The usual form is [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, although [[diary|diary entries]], [[newspaper]] clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic "documents" such as recordings and radio, [[blogs]], and [[e-mails]] have also come into use. The word ''[[wikt:epistolary|epistolary]]'' is derived from [[Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἐπιστολή ''epistolē'', meaning a letter (see [[epistle]]).

The epistolary form can add greater [[realism (arts)|realism]] to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an [[omniscient narrator]].

==Early works==
There are two theories on the genesis of the epistolary novel. The first claims that the genre originated from novels with inserted letters, in which the portion containing the third person narrative in between the letters was gradually reduced.&lt;ref&gt;E.Th. Voss. ''Erzählprobleme des Briefromans, dargestellt an vier Beispielen des 18. Jahrhunderts.'' Bonn, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The other theory claims that the epistolary novel arose from [[Miscellany|miscellanies]] of letters and poetry: some of the letters were tied together into a (mostly amorous) plot.&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Bray. ''L'art de la lettre amoureuse: des manuels aux romans (1550-1700).'' La Haye/Paris, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Both claims have some validity. The first truly epistolary novel, the Spanish "Prison of Love" (''Cárcel de amor'') (c.1485) by [[Diego de San Pedro]], belongs to a tradition of novels in which a large number of inserted letters already dominated the narrative. Other well-known examples of early epistolary novels are closely related to the tradition of letter-books and miscellanies of letters. Within the successive editions of [[Edmé Boursault]]'s ''Letters of Respect, Gratitude and Love'' (''Lettres de respect, d'obligation et d'amour'') (1669), a group of letters written to a girl named Babet were expanded and became more and more distinct from the other letters, until it formed a small epistolary novel entitled ''Letters to Babet'' (''Lettres à Babet''). The immensely famous ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' (''Lettres portugaises'') (1669) generally attributed to [[Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues]], though a small minority still regard [[Marianna Alcoforado]] as the author, is claimed to be intended to be part of a miscellany of Guilleragues prose and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;G. de [[Guilleragues]]. ''Lettres portugaises, Valentins et autres oeuvres.'' Paris, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;
The founder of the epistolary novel in English is said by many to be [[James Howell]] (1594–1666) with [[Epistolae Ho-Elianae | "Familiar Letters"]] (1645–50), who writes of prison, foreign adventure, and the love of women.

The first novel to expose the complex play that the genre allows was [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', which appeared in three volumes in 1684, 1685, and 1687. The novel shows the genre's results of changing perspectives: individual points were presented by the individual characters, and the central voice of the author and moral evaluation disappeared (at least in the first volume; her further volumes introduced a narrator). Behn furthermore explored a realm of intrigue with letters that fall into the wrong hands, faked letters, letters withheld by protagonists, and even more complex interaction.

The epistolary novel as a genre became popular in the 18th century in the works of such authors as [[Samuel Richardson]], with his immensely successful novels ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela]]'' (1740) and ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1749). In France, there was ''[[Lettres persanes]]'' (1721) by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], followed by ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'' (1761) by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Laclos]]' ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782), which used the epistolary form to great dramatic effect, because the sequence of events was not always related directly or explicitly. In Germany, there was [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774) (''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'') and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s ''[[Hyperion (Hölderlin)|Hyperion]]''. The first North American novel, ''The History of Emily Montague'' (1769) by [[Frances Brooke]] was written in epistolary form.

Starting in the 18th century, the epistolary form was subject to much ridicule, resulting in a number of savage [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]]s. The most notable example of these was [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Shamela]]'' (1741), written as a parody of ''Pamela''. In it, the female narrator can be found wielding a pen and scribbling her diary entries under the most dramatic and unlikely of circumstances. [[Oliver Goldsmith]] used the form to satirical effect in ''[[The Citizen of the World]]'', subtitled "Letters from a Chinese Philosopher Residing in London to his Friends in the East" (1760–61). So did the diarist [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]] in a successful comic first novel, ''[[Evelina]]'' (1788).

The epistolary novel slowly fell out of use in the late 18th century. Although [[Jane Austen]] tried her hand at the epistolary in juvenile writings and her [[novella]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'' (1794), she abandoned this structure for her later work. It is thought that her lost novel ''First Impressions'', which was redrafted to become ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', may have been epistolary: ''Pride and Prejudice'' contains an unusual number of letters quoted in full and some play a critical role in the plot.

The epistolary form nonetheless saw continued use, surviving in exceptions or in fragments in nineteenth-century novels. In [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''[[Mémoires de deux jeunes mariées|Letters of Two Brides]]'', two women who became friends during their education at a convent correspond over a 17-year period, exchanging letters describing their lives. [[Mary Shelley]] employs the epistolary form in her novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818). Shelley uses the letters as one of a variety of framing devices, as the story is presented through the letters of a sea captain and scientific explorer attempting to reach the north pole who encounters Victor Frankenstein and records the dying man's narrative and confessions. Published in 1848, [[Anne Brontë]]'s novel ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' is framed as a retrospective letter from one of the main heroes to his friend and brother-in-law with the diary of the eponymous tenant inside it. In the late 19th century, [[Bram Stoker]] released one of the most widely recognized and successful novels in the epistolary form to date, ''[[Dracula]]''. Printed in 1897, the novel is compiled entirely of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, doctor's notes, ship's logs, and the like.

==Types==
There are three types of epistolary novels: monologic (giving the letters of only one character, like ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun'' and ''The Sorrows of Young Werther''), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters, like Mme [[Marie Jeanne Riccoboni]]'s ''Letters of Fanni Butlerd'' (1757), and polylogic (with three or more letter-writing characters, such as in Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]''). In addition, a crucial element in polylogic epistolary novels like ''Clarissa'', and ''Dangerous Liaisons'' is the dramatic device of 'discrepant awareness': the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains creating dramatic tension.

An important strategic device in the epistolary novel for creating the impression of authenticity of the letters is the [[fictional editor]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Takeda. ''Die Erfindung des Anderen: Zur Genese des fiktionalen Herausgebers im Briefroman des 18. Jahrhunderts''. Würzburg, 2008; U. Wirth. ''Die Geburt des Autors aus dem Geist der Herausgeberfiktion. Editoriale Rahmung im Roman um 1800''. Munich, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later works==
{{see also|List of contemporary epistolary novels}}
Epistolary novels have made several memorable appearances in more recent literature:

*[[John Cleland]]'s early erotic novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748) is written as a series of letters from the titular character to an unnamed recipient.
*''[[The Coquette|The Coquette; or, The History of Eliza Wharton]]'' (1797) by [[Hannah Webster Foster]] is a series of letters between several characters.
*[[Sophia Briscoe]] used the form in both her novels: ''Miss Melmoth...'' (1771) and ''The Fine Lady...'' (1772).
*[[Marianne Ehrmann]] wrote the epistolary novel ''Amalie and Minna'' around 1787. 
*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] used the epistolary format for his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'' (1846), as a series of letters between two friends, struggling to cope with their impoverished circumstances and life in pre-revolution Russia.
*''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868) by [[Wilkie Collins]] uses a collection of various documents to construct a detective novel in English. In the second piece, a character explains that he is writing his portion because another had observed to him that the events surrounding the disappearance of the eponymous diamond might reflect poorly on the family, if misunderstood, and therefore he was collecting the true story. This is an unusual element, as most epistolary novels present the documents without questions about how they were gathered. He also used the form previously in ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' (1859).
*Spanish foreign minister [[Juan Valera y Alcalá-Galiano|Juan Valera's]] ''Pepita Jimenez'' (1874) is written in three sections, the first and third being a series of letters, the middle part narrated by an unknown observer.
*[[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) uses not only letters and diaries, but also dictation [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinders]] and [[newspaper]] accounts.
*[[Jean Webster]]'s ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy-Long-Legs]]'' (1912).
*[[Dorothy L. Sayers]] and [[Robert Eustace]]'s ''[[The Documents in the Case]]'' (1930).
*[[Haki Stërmilli]]'s novel ''[[If I Were a Boy (novel)|If I Were a Boy]]'' (1936) is written in the form of diary entries documenting the life of the protagonist.
*[[Kathrine Taylor]]'s ''[[Kathrine Taylor#Address Unknown .281938.29|Address Unknown]]'' (1938) is an anti-Nazi novel in which the final letter is returned marked "Address Unknown", indicating the disappearance of the German character.
*[[Virginia Woolf]] used the epistolary form for her feminist essay ''[[Three Guineas]]'' (1938).
*[[C. S. Lewis]] used the epistolary form for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), and considered writing a companion novel from an [[angel]]'s point of view—though he never did so. It is less generally realized that his ''[[Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer]]'' (1964) is a similar exercise, exploring theological questions through correspondence addressed to a fictional recipient, "Malcolm", though this work may be considered a "novel" only loosely in that developments in Malcolm's personal life gradually come to light and impact the discussion.
*[[Thornton Wilder]]'s fifth novel ''[[Ides of March (novel)|Ides of March]]'' (1948) consists of letters and documents illuminating the last days of the Roman Republic.
*[[Mark Harris (author)|Mark Harris]]'s comic novel ''Wake Up, Supid'' (1959) is made up of letters, telegrams, newspaper clippings and pamphlets, all sent either to or from the protagonist.
*[[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short novel ''[[Some of Your Blood]]'' (1961) consists of letters and case-notes relating to the psychiatric treatment of a non-supernatural vampire.
*[[Saul Bellow]]'s novel ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]'' (1964) is largely written in letter format. These are both real and imagined letters, written by the protagonist Moses Herzog to family members, friends, and celebrities.
*''Up the Down Staircase'' is a novel written by Bel Kaufman, published in 1965, which spent 64 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. In 1967 it was released as a movie starring Patrick Bedford, Sandy Dennis and Eileen Heckart.
*[[Shūsaku Endō]]'s novel ''[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]'' (1966) is an example of the epistolary form, half of which consists of letters from Rodrigues, the other half either in the third person or in letters from other persons. 
*''[[The Anderson Tapes (novel)|The Anderson Tapes]]'' (1969, 1970) by Lawrence Sanders is a novel primarily consisting of transcripts of tape recordings.
*''[[84, Charing Cross Road]]'' (1970) is not a novel but a true account by [[Helene Hanff]] written in epistolary form as an exchange of letters between the writer in New York City and a bookseller in London over the course of two decades.
*[[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' (1974) is written in an epistolary structure through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and book excerpts.
*In [[John Barth]]'s epistolary work ''[[LETTERS (novel)|Letters]]'' (1979), the author interacts with characters from his other novels.
*[[Alice Walker]] employed the epistolary form in ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982). The 1985 film adaptation echoes the form by incorporating into the script some of the novel's letters, which the actors deliver as monologues.
*''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾]]'' (1982) by [[Sue Townsend]] is a comic novel in the form of a diary set in 1980s Britain.
*''[[The Good War]]: An Oral History of World War II'' (1984) by [[Studs Terkel]] is not a novel but a compilation of interviews with people who lived the events from the beginning of America's involvement in [[World War II]], Pearl Harbor, to the end.
*[[Michael Dibdin]]'s ''A Rich Full Death'' (1986) is an epistolary crime novel set in 19th-century Florence.
*[[John Updike]]'s ''S.'' (1988) is an epistolary novel consisting of the heroine's letters and transcribed audio recordings.
*[[Patricia Wrede]] and [[Caroline Stevermer]]'s ''[[Patricia Wrede#Cecelia and Kate|Sorcery and Cecelia]]'' (1988) is an epistolary fantasy novel in a Regency setting from the first-person perspectives of cousins Kate and Cecelia, who recount their adventures in magic and polite society. Unusually for modern fiction, it's written using the style of the [[letter game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Patricia C. Wrede |url=http://enchantedinkpot.livejournal.com/18779.html |website=The Enchanted Inkpot |accessdate=27 February 2016 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Edward Irving Wortis|Avi]]'s young-adult novel ''[[Nothing But the Truth (novel)|Nothing But the Truth]]'' (1991) uses only documents, letters, and scripts.
*''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' (1996) by [[Helen Fielding]] is written in the form of a personal diary.

*Several of [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novels are written in the forms of diaries, letters, or memoirs.
*''[[La silla del águila]] (The Eagle's Throne)'' by [[Carlos Fuentes]] (2003) is a political satire written as a series of letters between persons in high levels of the Mexican government in 2020. The epistolary format is treated by the author as a consequence of necessity: the United States impedes all telecommunications in Mexico as a retaliatory measure, leaving letters and smoke signals as the only possible methods of communication, particularly ironic given one character's observation that "Mexican politicians put nothing in writing."
*''[[We Need to Talk About Kevin]]'' (2003) is a monologic epistolary novel written as a series of letters from Eva, Kevin's mother, to her husband Franklin.
*The 2004 novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' by [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]] tells a story in several time periods in a nested format, with some sections told in epistolary style, including an interview, journal entries and a series of letters.

==Other media==
*"[[Dear Dad]]", episode twelve of the first season of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', used the framing device of a letter written by [[Hawkeye Pierce]] to his father to describe the events of the episode.
*"[[The Stackhouse Filibuster]]", episode seventeen of the second season of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', used the framing device of emails sent by [[C.J. Cregg]], [[Josh Lyman]] and [[Sam Seaborn]] to their respective parents to describe the events of the episode. Aaron Sorkin also used this device on his earlier show ''[[Sports Night]]''.
*Epistolary songs include [[The Beatles]]' "P.S. I Love You", [[Eminem]]'s "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]", [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Famous Blue Raincoat]]", [[Tom Waits]]'s "[[Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis]]" and [[Bloodhound Gang]]'s "The Ballad of Chasey Lain".
*[[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]]'s ''[[Marjorie Daw (short story)|Marjorie Daw]]'' and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' are two examples of epistolary [[short stories]].
*The works of [[Christine Love (visual novelist)|Christine Love]] all share an epistolary style; from the forum documents and e-mails of "[[Digital: A Love Story]]", the e-mails and chat logs of students in "[[Don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story]]". "[[Analogue: A Hate Story]]" and "[[Hate Plus]]" are tales told in the form of diary entries and letters between residents of the colonial spaceship, the Mugunghwa.
*''[[Dear Esther]]'' is a 2012 video game by [[thechineseroom]] that allows the player to traverse an uninhabited Hebridean island; as the player does this, letters and diary excerpts are recalled audibly by the narrator to reveal the story and encourage progression towards certain areas. These narrations are randomly chosen, and so a different story (or more details of the same story) are revealed during multiple playthroughs of the game.
*The [[Frictional Games]] video games ''[[Penumbra: Overture]]'' (2007) and its sequel ''[[Penumbra: Black Plague]]'' (2008) are framed in the form of an e-mail written by the protagonist Philip to an outside contact and the story culminates at the point of writing. The developer's later 2010 title ''[[Amnesia: The Dark Descent]]'' would also frequently refer to letters as a means of exposition, as well as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, but this time read through by the original writer Daniel after chemically inducing memory loss.
*The entire ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise can be described as epistolary to a degree, as its characters are frequently heard making entries in their personal or official logs, whichever is applicable.
*The text portions the multimedia webcomic [[Homestuck]] are largely composed of online chats between characters, interspersed with commentary by several omniscient in-universe narrators who interact with the plot.

'''''Final Destination''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] composed of five films, comic books and novels. It is based on an unproduced [[spec script]] by [[Jeffrey Reddick]], originally written for ''[[The X-Files]]'' television series, and was distributed by [[New Line Cinema]]. All five films center around a small group of people who escape impending death when one individual (the protagonist of each film) has a sudden [[Precognition|premonition]] and warns them that they will all die in a terrible [[mass-casualty incident|mass-casualty accident]]. After avoiding their foretold deaths, the survivors are killed one by one in bizarre accidents caused by an unseen force creating complicated chains of cause and effect, resembling [[Rube Goldberg machine]]s in their complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conrich|first1=Ian|title=Puzzles, Contraptions and the Highly Elaborate Moment: The Inevitability of Death in the Grand Slasher Narratives of the Final Destination and Saw Series of Films|journal=Style and Form in the Hollywood Slasher Film|date=2015|pages=106–117|doi=10.1057/9781137496478_8|url=https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137496478_8|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is noteworthy among other films in the horror genre in that the antagonist is not a stereotypical slasher or other physical being, but [[Death (personification)|Death]] personified, subtly manipulating circumstances in the environment with a design on claiming anyone who escapes their fated demise.

In addition to the films, a novel series, which includes the novelizations of the first three films, was published throughout 2005 and 2006 by [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]]. A one-shot comic book titled ''Final Destination: Sacrifice'' was released alongside select DVDs of ''Final Destination 3'' in 2006, and a comic series titled ''Final Destination: Spring Break'' was published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] in 2007.

===Overview===
====Final Destination====
In the original ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'', high school student [[Alex Browning]] ([[Devon Sawa]]) boards Volee Airlines Flight 180 with his classmates for a field trip to [[Paris]], France. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition that the plane will explode in mid-air, killing everyone on board. When the events from his vision begin to repeat themselves in reality, he panics, and a fight breaks out, which leads to several passengers being left behind, including [[Clear Rivers]] ([[Ali Larter]]), Carter Horton ([[Kerr Smith]]), Billy Hitchcock ([[Seann William Scott]]), Valerie Lewton ([[Kristen Cloke]]), Terry Chaney ([[Amanda Detmer]]), and Tod Waggner ([[Chad Donella]]), who witness the plane explode moments later. Afterwards, the survivors begin to die one by one through a series of bizarre accidents, and Alex attempts to find a way to "cheat" Death's plan before it is too late. Six months later, Alex, Clear, and Carter travel to Paris to celebrate their survival, believing they have finally cheated Death; however, after Carter is crushed by a giant neon sign, they realize that Death's plan is still in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wong, James (Director)|title=[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Destination 2====
''[[Final Destination 2]]'', picking up one year after the first film, features college student Kimberly Corman ([[A. J. Cook (actress)|A. J. Cook]]) heading to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] for spring break with her friends Shaina, Dano, and Frankie ([[Sarah Carter]], Alex Rae, and [[Shaun Sipos]]). En route, Kimberly has a premonition of a huge car [[multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up]] on Route 23, killing everyone involved. She stalls her SUV on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including state trooper Thomas Burke ([[Michael Landes]]), Eugene Dix ([[Terrence C. Carson|T.C. Carson]]), Rory Peters ([[Jonathan Cherry (actor)|Jonathan Cherry]]), Kat Jennings ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]), Nora and Tim Carpenter ([[Lynda Boyd]] and James Kirk), Evan Lewis ([[David Paetkau]]), and pregnant Isabella Hudson ([[Justina Machado]]). While Officer Burke questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs as she predicted. In the days following the accident, the survivors begin to die one by one in a series of bizarre accidents. After learning about the explosion of Flight 180, Kimberly teams up with Clear Rivers, the only survivor of Flight 180, to try to save a new group of people from Death. This time the survivors are told that only "new life" can defeat Death, and they must stay alive long enough for Isabella to have her baby. It is later revealed that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up, and Kimberly drowns herself in a lake so that she can be resuscitated by emergency staff, thus granting her "new life"; saving her and Officer Burke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Ellis, David R. (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 2]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Destination 3====
''[[Final Destination 3]]'', set five years after{{#tag:ref|''Final Destination 3'' is set in 2005. Kevin Fischer's statement to Wendy Christensen outside their school that the Flight 180 explosion from the first film occurred "six years ago" is a continuity error, as the first film is set in 2000.|group="note"}} the explosion of Flight 180 and four years after the pile-up on Route 23, has high school student Wendy Christensen ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]) visiting an amusement park for grad night with her friends Kevin Fischer ([[Ryan Merriman]]), Jason Wise ([[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]]), and Carrie Dreyer ([[Gina Holden]]). As Wendy and her friends board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the ride will crash, killing everyone on board. When Wendy panics a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride before the accident occurs, including Kevin, Wendy's younger sister Julie ([[Amanda Crew]]), Ian McKinley ([[Kris Lemche]]), Perry Malinowski (Maggie Ma), Erin Ulmer ([[Alexz Johnson]]), Lewis Romero ([[Texas Battle]]), Frankie Cheeks ([[Sam Easton]]), and Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin ([[Chelan Simmons]] and [[Crystal Lowe]]). When the survivors start to die one by one in a series of strange accidents, Wendy and Kevin set out to save those who remain after they learn of the events of the first two films. Most of their attempts are futile, with the exception of Julie and themselves, leading them to believe they have cheated Death. However, the three "coincidentally" cross paths five months later and are caught in a horrifying subway accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Wong, James (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 3]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Final Destination====
In &lt;!-- The film's title is "The Final Destination", not "Final Destination 4" --&gt;''[[The Final Destination]]'', set nine years after the explosion of Flight 180, eight years after the pile-up on Route 23 and four years after the Devil's Flight disaster, college student Nick O'Bannon ([[Bobby Campo]]) visits the McKinley Speedway for a study break with his friends Lori Milligan, Janet Cunningham, and Hunt Wynorski. While watching the race, Nick has a premonition that a race car crash will send debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse on the guests. When Nick panics a fight breaks out and several people leave before the accident occurs, including, his friends Lori ([[Shantel VanSanten]]), Janet ([[Haley Webb]]), and Hunt ([[Nick Zano]]), security guard George Lanter ([[Mykelti Williamson]]), and spectators Jonathan Groves (Jackson Walker), Andy Kewzer ([[Andrew Fiscella]]), Samantha Lane ([[Krista Allen]]), Carter Daniels ([[Justin Welborn]]), and Nadia Monroy ([[Stephanie Honoré]]). Once again, the survivors are killed in a series of strange accidents except for Janet, who is rescued just moments before her death. This leads the remaining survivors to believe that they have cheated Death, until Nick has another premonition of a disastrous explosion at a shopping mall, which he manages to prevent, saving himself, Lori, and Janet. Two weeks later, Nick realizes the mall disaster vision was only meant to lead them to where Death needed them to be and all three are killed by a runaway semi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Ellis, David R. (Director)|title=[[The Final Destination]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[New Line Cinema]]|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final Destination 5====
In ''[[Final Destination 5]]'', set two months before the explosion of Flight 180, Sam Lawton ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]) is on his way to a corporate retreat with his colleagues. While they cross the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone on it. Sam manages to persuade several of his co-workers to get off the bridge before the accident occurs, including Molly Harper ([[Emma Bell]]), Nathan Sears ([[Arlen Escarpeta]]), Peter Friedkin ([[Miles Fisher]]), Dennis Lapman ([[David Koechner]]), [[Olivia Castle]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), Isaac Palmer ([[P. J. Byrne]]), and Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe). After Candice and Isaac die in bizarre accidents, Sam is warned that Death is still after the survivors and told that if he wants to live he must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and claim their remaining lifespan. Olivia and Dennis are killed before they have a chance to save themselves, but Nathan claims the lifespan of a co-worker when he accidentally causes his death in a warehouse accident. Peter attempts to kill Molly, jealous that she survived instead of Candice. He eventually gains the lifespan of an investigating agent, but is killed by Sam before he can kill Molly. Sam and Molly later board a plane to Paris, which is later revealed to be Flight 180 from the first film. Unable to get off the plane, both are killed in the resulting explosion. The landing gear is sent flying towards New York City and crashes into a cocktail bar, killing Nathan, since the co-worker whose life he claimed had a terminal illness and was due to die "any day now".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Quale, Steven (Director)|title=[[Final Destination 5]]|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
''Final Destination'' was written by [[Jeffrey Reddick]] after having "read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.'". The woman switched flights and the plane she was originally supposed to take crashed. Originally having written the script as an episode of ''[[The X Files]]'', Reddick decided to turn the script into a feature-length film at the behest of one of his [[New Line Cinema]] colleagues. After reading his spec script, New Line Cinema hired Reddick to write the screenplay; [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]] and [[Glen Morgan]] were later brought on board to help with the script, making alterations to comply with their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albin |first1=Andrea |title=[Special Feature] ‘Final Destination’: Not So Final After All! |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/ |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042727/http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/25828/special-feature-final-destination-not-so-final-after-all/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |date=12 August 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The first three films received mixed reviews. The fourth film received mostly negative reviews. The fifth film received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="mc-fd5" /&gt; The franchise has been praised for its innovative premise, of the invisible abstract concept of Death killing people, instead of a usual slasher killer; the death sequences have also been praised for their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrow|first1=Brendan|title=Is 'Final Destination' the Best Horror Franchise in History?|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3386435/final-destination-best-horror-franchise-history/|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
===Novels===
Throughout 2005, publishing company [[Black Flame (publisher)|Black Flame]] released a series of ''Final Destination'' books which faithfully follow the premise of the films, with each involving a group of people who find themselves targeted by Death after surviving a catastrophe of some sort due to a character experiencing a precognitive vision. Their first five novels all featured original stories, with the first novel, entitled ''Dead Reckoning'', has [[punk rock]]er Jessica Golden saving herself and several others from the collapse of Club Kitty in [[Los Angeles]], earning Death's ire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Natasha | title = Final Destination: Dead Reckoning | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-03-15 | isbn = 1844161706}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Destination Zero'', also set in LA, has magazine employee Patricia Fuller and few others survive a train bombing and afterward, while being stalked by Death, Patti learns this is not the first time her family has been hunted by the entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McIntee | first = David | title = Final Destination: Destination Zero | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-03-15 | isbn = 1844161714}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''End of the Line'' has a group of [[New York City]] [[New York City Subway|subway]] crash survivors, led by twins Danny and Louise King, trying to escape Death, who uses an unknowing agent to hasten its acquisition of the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levene | first = Rebecca | title = Final Destination: End of the Line | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-06-07 | isbn = 1844161765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dead Man's Hand'' a group meant to die in the crash of a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] glass elevator are stalked by both Death and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the latter believing the group's savior Allie Goodwin-Gaines was responsible for the elevator crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roman | first = Steven | title = Final Destination: Dead Man's Hand | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-09-13 | isbn = 1844161773}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Looks Could Kill'' has beautiful New York model Stephanie "Sherry" Pulaski stopping her friends from boarding a [[yacht]] when she has a vision of it exploding, but is left horribly disfigured and comatose by flying debris moments afterward when her vision comes true; eventually awakening the embittered Stephanie makes a deal with Death, aiding it in claiming her friends in exchange for having her good looks restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Nancy | title = Final Destination: Looks Could Kill | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2005-11-29 | isbn = 1844163164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the run of the original series of books Black Flame released novelizations of the first three films in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Natasha | title = Final Destination | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-03 | isbn = 1844163172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = Nancy | title = Final Destination 2 | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-31 | isbn = 1844163180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Faust | first = Christa | title = Final Destination 3 | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-01-03 | isbn = 1844163199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Flame's last ''Final Destination'' novel was ''Death of the Senses'' released in mid-2006. Taking place in New York the book has a homeless man named Jack Curtis saving policewoman Amy Tom from a maniac after having a vision of Amy's death; Amy's attacker is later revealed to be a serial killer who was meant to murder six other people (representing the first [[sense|five senses]] and [[Extrasensory perception|a sixth]]) who Death begins targeting as Jack and Amy rush to find and warn the intended victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McDermott | first = Andy | title = Final Destination: Death of the Senses | publisher = Black Flame | date = 2006-08-01 | isbn = 1844163857}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, due to a printing error, only available for a short period of time before being recalled, leaving only a few copies in circulation. A tenth novel, titled ''Wipeout'' and written by Alex Johnson, was planned, but cancelled; the book would have featured a pair of surfers and several others, after surviving a plane crash in Hawaii, being hunted by Death and the survivor of another disaster, an unstable soldier who had nearly died in an ambush in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Alex | title = Final Destination: Wipeout | publisher = Black Flame | date = | isbn = 1844164098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
The first ''Final Destination'' comic book, titled ''Sacrifice'', was published by [[Zenescope Entertainment]] and came packaged with a limited-edition DVD of ''Final Destination 3'', sold exclusively at [[Circuit City Corporation|Circuit City]] stores. The premise of the story involves the survivor of a terrible accident and his friend Jim, who continually experiences images of other people's deaths, isolating himself from the rest of the world to escape the visions that torment him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zenescope &amp; Circuit City Offer Exclusive "Final Destination" Comic |url=http://www.cbr.com/zenescope-circuit-city-offer-exclusive-final-destination-comic/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=14 July 2017 |archivedate=14 July 2017 |date=13 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714210224/http://www.cbr.com/zenescope-circuit-city-offer-exclusive-final-destination-comic/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zenescope later released a five-issue miniseries, titled ''Final Destination: Spring Break'', which involves a group led by Carly Hagan being stalked by Death after surviving a hotel fire and becoming stranded in [[Cancún|Cancún, Mexico]].

'''Grapevine radio''' refers to the transmission infrastructures, used for distributing audio programs, which were built to serve a small number of rural [[upstate South Carolina]] communities from the early 1930s to the middle 1940s. Despite their name, these systems did not employ radio transmitters, but were actually a type of "[[telephone newspaper]]", because the programs were sent telephonically over wires strung to subscribing homes.

The equipment used to distribute programming over a facility's wire network was located at a central site, for example a general store's back room. Programs normally consisted of retransmissions of radio stations, however, some programming was locally produced, originating from a studio at the distribution site or relayed from a local church or other gathering place. The locally produced programs included announcements and emergency messages, commercials and live performances. The transmissions were made daily, generally starting around 6 a.m. and running until 10:00 p.m. or midnight.

The grapevine systems soon became unneeded, because they primarily served homes that did not have electricity. Once a community received electric service the local grapevine system would soon close down, as the subscribers switched to radio receivers that could receive a wide selection of programs at no cost, instead of the single program and monthly fees characteristic of the grapevine systems.
==Historical background==
Information about the grapevine installations (also called "speakerline") is limited, because of their brief history and the fact that they do not appear to have been established outside a small region of South Carolina. Unlike radio stations, they did not require government approval to operate. Their existence was also dependent on an unusual and short-lived economic and technical environment, as they required a central distribution site that had access to electricity, plus a surrounding community of prospective subscribers that did not have electric service.

Throughout the 1930s large parts of the United States, including most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less [[Crystal radio|crystal radio receivers]], and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the [[Great Depression]] meant that many people could not even afford a newspaper subscription. Thus, there was a lack of entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/37277242/THE_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RURAL_WIRED_RADIO_SYSTEMS_IN_UPSTATE_SOUTH_CAROLINA "The Development of Rural Wired Radio Systems in Upstate South Carolina"] by Susan K. Opt, ''Journal of Radio Studies 1'' (1992), pages 73-74. (academia.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that "we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world".&lt;ref&gt;''Listening to Radio, 1920-1950'' by Ray Barfield, 1996, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rural electrification#United States|rural electrification]] projects of the 1930s and 1940s eventually eliminated potential customers, making the grapevine systems no longer needed as their former customers switched to listening to radio stations.
==Initial installation at Mauldin==
[[File:Map of Mauldin, South Carolina grapevine radio system (1936).gif|thumb|right|425px|Wire layout of Gordon Rogers' "grapevine radio" installation as of 1936. The transmissions originated from his home near Mauldin, South Carolina.]]
The first grapevine system was begun in the winter of 1930-1931 by a high school student, Gordon F. Rogers, who lived on farm in central Greenville county near [[Mauldin, South Carolina]]. The Rogers farm, unlike most of its neighbors, had electrical service. Gordon Rogers had shown an early aptitude for engineering, developing a clock that automatically turned on the farm's chicken coup lights at 3:00 a.m., as well as an automated system for watering the chickens.&lt;ref name="yen"&gt;"Yen for Electricity Takes SC Country Boy a Long Way: The Gordon Rogers Story", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', April 22, 1952, page 11-A.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers also had an early interest in radio. Dissatisfied with a battery operated set, he successfully reconditioned a vacuum tube receiver that ran on AC electrical power. At this point he decided to also run a single-wire connection with a ground return from his receiver to a loudspeaker at the home of a neighbor who didn't have electricity. With this setup, whenever Rogers' radio was on the neighbor also heard what was being received. Word of this innovation quickly spread, and within a month lines had been run to seven nearby homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/ARCHIVE-RCA/RCA-Engineer/1980-07-08.pdf#page=71 "Bringing Radio to the Rural Home"] by G. F. Rogers, ''RCA Engineer'', July/August 1980 (Vol. 26, No. 1), pages 69-71. (americanradiohistory.com) &lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers' system was essentially sending one-way telephone signals over his own wires, but he had to use voltages far higher than that used by standard telephone lines, because he was sending not only audio but also the power needed to operate what would become hundreds of loudspeakers. His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers had to provide the wire, poles (often actually fence posts) and speakers needed to connect to the main system lines. Unskilled attempts by individuals to tap into the lines without paying generally caused service disruptions for nearby customers, which made it possible to locate and remove the improper connections. Although at first the service was provided for free, as the number of participants grew Rogers began charging a monthly 10 cent fee.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This charge was later raised to 25 cents, and at times a $1 surcharge was applied to finance replacement of sections of the transmission lines that needed to be upgraded from the original iron wire to higher quality materials. The system became profitable enough to finance Rogers' attendance at [[Clemson University|Clemson College]].&lt;ref name="yen"/&gt; In 1933, at the time of his college enrollment, the system had 5 miles (8 kilometers) of lines and 15 subscribers. Increasing demand, spurred by finding a source of affordable speakers ($2.85 each), expanded the number of connections to more than 200 within the next four months, and by June 1934 the transmission lines spanned 15 miles (24 kilometers). By around 1935, there were 600 homes connected to the grapevine service, including sites in [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]] and [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] counties, located up to 24 miles (38 kilometers) distant from the Rogers farm distribution site. The infrastructure had also grown to 400 miles (645 kilometers) of transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) pages 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Programming was provided for about 12 hours each day. Rogers introduced a "local talent" program that featured live performances. A record player provided music for times when static made it difficult to receive the radio rebroadcasts that provided most of the schedule. Provisions were also made to make local announcements.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a [[carrier current]] link from the system based at Ware Place allowed programming originating at that location to be picked up and concurrently transmitted by the Mauldin system.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the spring of 1936, Rogers, now a junior at Clemson, presented a paper, "Bringing Radio to the Rural Home", at a regional conference of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], which provided technical information about his innovation. His review won first place in its category.&lt;ref&gt;"Clemson Junior Contest Winner", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', April 23, 1936, page 5. Rogers' paper was republished in the July/August 1980 issue of ''RCA Engineer'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauldin-based system remained in operation until the area received electrical service, shutting down around 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional installations==
===Ware Place===
Gordon Rogers' original system served northern [[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville county]]. A second wire network, originating from a small store in [[Ware Place, South Carolina]], was later established which provided an extensive program service for the southern part of the county. The store's owners, J. R. Chandler, Jr. and his cousin J. E. Chandler, became familiar with the Mauldin facility, and around 1934 arranged for Gordon Rogers and Sherman Fox to install similar distribution equipment at their store.&lt;ref&gt;''Images of America: Fork Shoals'', 2012, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandlers became active participants operating the system and supplying local programming. A studio, which included a piano and a pulpit, was built in the rear of the store. There was also a connection to the local school.&lt;ref&gt;"Augusta Road Life Livened by 'Grapevine'" by Hattie S. Sims, ''The Greenville (South Carolina) News'', March 3, 1957, page 1-D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers were initially charged 25 cents a month, which was later increased to 35 cents. Individual homes had to maintain their local wire connections, and purchase their own speakers: $3 to $5 for a small one, and $7 to $8 for a large one. An unusual additional benefit resulted from the discovery that, after the grapevine programming ended for the night, individual subscribers could hear each other if they spoke loudly into their speakers, resulting in a form of party-line communication. At its peak over 500 homes were connected. The system continued to run during World War II in order to supply war news, after which it was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hickory Tavern===
This installation helped launch the political career of Robert C. Wasson, who went on to become the state's Tax Chairman. The Wasson family ran a small store in [[Hickory Tavern, South Carolina]], located in southwest Laurens county. The needed equipment was purchased in March 1936 and the service was immediately popular. Later that year, when Robert Wasson announced what would be a successful candidacy for the [[South Carolina House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]], a newspaper report noted that the store he ran "is known as Wasson Brothers store, mill, and grapevine radio system serving 200 rural homes".&lt;ref&gt;"Robert C. Wasson Seeks House Seat", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', July 8, 1936, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers were charged 25 cents per month, and paid $6.50 for a small speaker or $10.50 for a large one — this fee included installation. Robert Wasson's mother, Effie Owens Wasson, handled most of the operational duties, and at its peak about 500 houses within a 12 mile (19 kilometer) radius were connected. Regular news reports and live entertainment made up an important part of the daily schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising over the facility was credited with helping to establish the Eaddy-Blakes corner drug store in Laurens, and a former pharmacy employee later wrote that "were Dr. Eaddy still living I'm sure he would attribute the biggest thing to his success in the drug business was this advertising... It cost him about a dollar a week and he had every person from the area as a regular customer in a short time". &lt;ref&gt;"Grapevine Radio System" (letter from R. A. Martin), ''The Greenville (South Carolina) News'', May 7, 1980, Section B, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wasson served seven terms in the South Carolina legislature. One of his political objectives was getting electrical service for his community, and after the rural electrification program reached his district the grapevine service ceased operations in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Grapevine': A Radio Started Career in Politics" by Jonathan W. Oatis (AP), ''Greenwood (South Carolina) Index-Journal'', August 11, 1980, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saylors Crossroads===
Saylors Crossroads, South Carolina is a small community located in southeastern [[Anderson County, South Carolina|Anderson county]]. This system was inspired by the existence of the Ware Place operations, and was established by Charles Murdock in 1937. The Murdock family operated a general store, and a small studio was constructed in a building behind the store. The grapevine service was run by Selma Saylors, who was the twin sister of Charles Murdock's wife. Programming primarily consisted of relaying the transmissions of a local radio station, [[WAIM]] in Anderson. WAIM signed off at 9 p.m. each evening, and at that point the program source was switched to picking up "a station in Cincinnati" (presumably [[WLW]]). Local programming included the Sunday morning church services from Mount Bethel Baptist Church, carried from 1938 to 1940. 

Subscribers paid 45 cents a month, and chose between three speaker sizes: a smaller square-shaped speaker for $7.50, a larger square-shaped speaker for $9.50, and a heart-shaped speaker for $12.50. The speaker purchases financed the installation of the wire connection to the main transmission lines. At its peak, the service had 500 subscribers. This system ended operations in 1941, after the community received electric service.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) pages 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Williamston===
This system was operated by Carl Ellison, who owned a general store located at [[Williamston, South Carolina]] in east central Anderson county. It remained in operation for "seven or eight years", starting sometime in the 1930s and continuing through at least 1940. It had also been initially inspired by the Ware Place operations.

The Ellisons lived in a house behind the general store, and they converted their living room to serve as a studio for locally produced programming. The service cost 50 cents a month, and reached 700 subscribers. Like the Ware Place system, after the grapevine programming ended for the night individuals could be heard by other subscribers by speaking loudly into their speakers. The system featured ministers from Greenville who preached over the system on Friday nights. It also carried the Sunday services from the First Baptist Church in Williamston.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) pages 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sites===
Gordon Rogers estimated that a total of ten to twelve grapevine operations were eventually installed, all located in South Carolina. Additional locations reportedly included Walhalla (located in the center of South Carolina's easternmost county, Oconee), another "near Mauldin", and one "across the Savannah river from Augusta, Georgia".&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">A '''helen''' is a [[List of humorous units of measurement|humorous unit of measurement]] based on the concept that [[Helen of Troy]], from the ''[[Iliad]]'', had a "face that launched a thousand ships". The helen is thus used to measure quantities of beauty in terms of the theoretical action that could be accomplished by the wielder of such beauty.

==Origin==
[[File:Enlèvement d'Hélène, Reni (Louvre INV 539) 09.jpg|thumb|Helen leaving for [[Troy]] with [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], as depicted by [[Guido Reni]]]]
The classic reference to Helen's beauty is [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s lines from the 1592 play ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'', "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/779/779-h/779-h.htm |title='&amp;#39;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus'&amp;#39; by Christopher Marlowe - Project Gutenberg |date= |accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of humorous pseudounits, then, 1&amp;nbsp;millihelen is the amount of beauty needed to launch a single ship.

According to ''[[The Rebel Angels]]'', a 1981 novel by [[Robertson Davies]], this system was invented by [[Cambridge]] mathematician [[W.A.H. Rushton]]. [[Isaac Asimov]] claimed to have invented the term in the 1940s as a graduate student in his 1992 collection of jokes and limericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |title=Asimov Laughs Again |publisher=Harper-Collins |page=200 |isbn=0060168269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asimovhumanists.org/AboutIsaacAssimov2.htm |title=About Isaac Asimov |publisher=Asimovhumanists.org |accessdate=2011-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614180101/http://asimovhumanists.org/AboutIsaacAssimov2.htm |archivedate=2012-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1958 letter to the ''[[New Scientist]]'', R.C. Winton proposes the milli-Helen as the amount of beauty required to launch one ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Winton |first=R.C. |date=13 November 1958 |title=The Mathematics of Beauty |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=HS-tcz9b_lcC&amp;lpg=PA1287&amp;dq=New%20Scientist%2013%20November%201958&amp;pg=PA1285#v=onepage&amp;q=beauty&amp;f=false |magazine=New Scientist |access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, P.&amp;nbsp;Lockwood noted that the unit had been independently proposed by Edgar J. Westbury and extended by the pair to negative values, where &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;milli-Helen was the amount of ugliness required to sink a battleship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lockwood |first=P. |date=8 January 1959 |title=Unit of Ugliness |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=92k0o9xk-RcC&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=New%20Scientist%201959%20Unit%20of%20Ugliness&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Scientist%201959%20Unit%20of%20Ugliness&amp;f=false |magazine=New Scientist |access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derived units==
The Catalogue of Ships from Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''[[The Iliad]]'', which describes in detail the commanders who came to fight for Helen and the ships they brought with them, details a total of 1,186 ships which came to fight the Trojan War.  As such, Helen herself has a beauty rating of 1.186 helens, capable of launching ''more'' than one thousand ships.

The "system" has been expanded by some writers, such as conceiving of negative values as measures of the ugliness required to ''beach'' a thousand ships. Writing a humorous article about the concept, [[David Goines]] considered a range of [[metric prefix]]es to the unit, ranging from the [[atto-|atto]]&lt;nowiki&gt;helen&lt;/nowiki&gt; (ah) which could merely "light up a [[Lucky Strike|Lucky]] while strolling past a shipyard", to the [[tera-|tera]]&lt;nowiki&gt;helen&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Th) able to "launch the equivalent of one quadrillion Greek warships and make serious inroads on the welfare of the galaxy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goines.net/Writing/HELEN_of_TROY.html |title=On the inefficiency of beauty contests and a suggestion for their modernization |first=David Lance |last=Goines |date=1987-08-04 |access-date=2012-03-18 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical physicist [[Thomas Fink]] defines beauty in ''The Man's Book''&lt;ref name=Fink_2006/&gt; both in terms of ships launched and in terms of the number of women, on average, than whom one woman will be more beautiful. He defines one ''helen'' (H) as the quantity of beauty to be more beautiful than 50&amp;nbsp;million women, the number of women estimated to have been alive in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]].&lt;ref name=Fink_2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Fink |first=Thomas |title=The Man's Book |location=London, UK |year=2006 |pages=44-45 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |edition=1st |isbn=978-0297851639 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fink_personal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/ |last=Fink |first=Thomas |title=The Man's Book |series=Thomas Fink personal webpage |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=2011-09-05 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fink also defines a related, but smaller unit called a “''helena''” (Ha), based on a [[logarithmic scale]], like the [[Richter scale]], or [[decibel]]s (dB). Ten helena (Ha) is the beauty sufficient for one oarsman (of which 50 are on a ship) to risk his life, or to be the most beautiful of a thousand women. Since the unit is logarithmic on a base of 2, for beauty to increase by 1&amp;nbsp;Ha, a woman must be the most beautiful of twice as many women, so one ''helen'' is equivalent to 25.6&amp;nbsp;Ha. The most beautiful woman who ever lived would score 34.2&amp;nbsp;Ha, the equivalent of 1.34&amp;nbsp;helen, the pick of a dozen women would be 3.6&amp;nbsp;Ha, or 0.14&amp;nbsp;helen.&lt;ref name=Fink_personal/&gt;

The '''iceberg theory''' (sometimes known as the "'''theory of omission'''") is a style of [[writing]] (turned colloquialism) coined by American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]]. As a young journalist, Hemingway had to focus his newspaper reports on immediate events, with very little context or interpretation. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this [[Minimalism|minimalistic]] style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.

== Background ==
Like other American writers such as  [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Willa Cather]], Hemingway worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist. After graduating from high school he went to work as a cub reporter for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',&lt;ref name="Meyers p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he quickly learned that truth often lurks below the surface of a story.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned about corruption in city politics, and that in hospital emergency rooms and police stations a mask of cynicism was worn "like armour to shield whatever vulnerabilities remained".&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"/&gt; In his pieces he wrote about relevant events, excluding the background. As foreign correspondent for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while living in Paris in the early 1920s,  he covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in more than a dozen articles. As his biographer Jeffrey Meyers explains, "he objectively reported only the immediate events in order to achieve a concentration and intensity of focus—a spotlight rather than a stage".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greco-Turkish War he gained valuable writing experience that he translated to the writing of fiction. He believed fiction could be based on reality, but that if an experience were to be distilled, as he explained,  then "what he made up was truer than what he remembered".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"/&gt;

|style="text-align: left;"|If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them.

|style="text"-align: left;"|—Ernest Hemingway in ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In 1923, Hemingway conceived of the idea of a new theory of writing after finishing his short story "Out of Season". In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', his posthumously published memoirs about his years as a young writer in Paris, he explains: "I omitted the real end [of "Out of Season"] which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&amp;nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.&lt;!-- expand and add quotation here --&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Hemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned "how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth."&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker also notes that the writing style of the "iceberg theory" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"/&gt;

For example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]," while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself—Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his essay "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway is clear about his method: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer explained how it brings a story ''gravitas'':

{{quote|Hemingway said that only the tip of the iceberg showed in fiction—your reader will see only what is above the water—but the knowledge that you have about your character that never makes it into the story acts as the bulk of the iceberg. And that is what gives your story weight and gravitas.|[[Jenna Blum]] in ''The Author at Work'', 2013&lt;ref name=JennaBlum8&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 9, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, "... that is what gives your story weight and gravitas. ... "&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From reading [[Rudyard Kipling]] Hemingway absorbed the practice of shortening [[prose]] as much as it could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in "The Art of the Short Story": "You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author strengthened the piece of fiction and that the "quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt; His style added to the aesthetic: using "declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world" with simple and plain language, Hemingway became "the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century" according to biographer Meyers.&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt;

In her paper "Hemingway's Camera Eye", Zoe Trodd explains that Hemingway uses repetition in prose to build a collage of snapshots to create an entire picture. Of his iceberg theory, she claims, it "is also a glacier waterfall, infused with movement by his multi-focal aesthetic".&lt;ref name="Trodd"&gt;{{Harvnb|Trodd|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she believes that Hemingway's iceberg theory "demanded that the reader feel the ''whole'' story" and that the reader is meant to "fill the gaps left by his omissions with their feelings".&lt;ref name="Trodd"/&gt;

Hemingway scholar Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama. The means of achieving a strong drama is to minimize, or omit, the feelings that produced the fiction he wrote.&lt;ref name ="Benson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway's iceberg theory highlights the symbolic implications of art. He makes use of physical action to provide an interpretation of the nature of man's existence. It can be convincingly proved that, "while representing human life through fictional forms, he has consistently set man against the background of his world and universe to examine the human situation from various points of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Early fiction and short stories ==
Gwendolyn Tetlow believes that Hemingway's early fiction such as "[[Indian Camp]]" shows his lack of concern for [[Character (arts)|character development]] by simply placing the character in his or her surroundings. However, in "Indian Camp" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" does not mention the word "abortion", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Big Two-Hearted River" Hemingway explains "is about a boy ... coming home from the war ... So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war, is omitted."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"/&gt; Hemingway intentionally left out something in "Indian Camp" and "Big Two-Hearted River"—two stories he considered to be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker explains that Hemingway's stories about sports are often about the athletes themselves and that the sport is incidental to the story. Moreover, the story "[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night—none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's story "Big Two-Hearted River" is ostensibly about nothing, as is "A Clean Well Lighted Place", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"/&gt;

== Novels ==
Benson believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a "distance" between himself and the character he "becomes more practiced, it would seem." Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as "the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails," as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.&lt;ref name ="Benson"/&gt;

Baker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a "lyric-poetical novel" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref name= "Baker1972 pp274-255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major "shock"—the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home—to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.&lt;ref name= "Meyers1985 p445"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: "Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: "In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to "strengthen [the] iceberg".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.&lt;ref name="Baker p338"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was awarded to Hemingway "for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Independent media''' refers to any form of [[media (communication)|media]], such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[newspaper]]s or the [[Internet]], that is free of influence by government or corporate interests. The term has varied applications. Within the [[United States]] and other [[developed country|developed countries]], it is often used synonymously with [[alternative media]] to refer to media that specifically distinguish themselves in relation to the [[mainstream media]]. In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.

==Alternative media==
{{Main|Alternative media}}
In developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or [[state media|government-owned]] [[mass media]]. Proponents of alternative media argue that the mainstream media are [[bias]]ed. While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence "alternative". As such, [[advocacy journalism]] tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term "alternative" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term "independent" over "alternative". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.

==In developing countries==
In many [[developing country|developing countries]], the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the [[economy]], [[health]], and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of [[self-censorship]], soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.

===Self-censorship===
{{Main|Self-censorship}}
Self-censorship is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[classified information|classifying]] one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s. In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger [[advertiser]]s or the publication's [[parent company]] in order to protect their livelihood.

===Soft censorship===
Soft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Soft Censorship: How Governments Around the Globe Use Money to Manipulate the Media'', http://cima.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cima-soft_censorship-report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.

==Development==
{{Main|Media development}}
Many organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its [[Journalism#Professional_and_ethical_standards|professional capacity]]. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

===Media development vs. media for development===
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. "Media for development" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT4D|ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

===Media development organizations===
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are [[Internews]], [[International Center for Journalists]] (ICFJ), and [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] (IREX). In addition, organizations like the [[Center for International Media Assistance]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Article 19]], and others monitor media development efforts and [[freedom of the press]] around the world.

'''Electrical lighting technicians''' ('''ELT''') or simply '''lighting tech.''', are involved with rigging stage and location sets and controlling artificial, electric lights for art and entertainment venues ([[theatre]] or live music venues) or in video, television, or [[film]] production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSCVPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA Stage Lighting Design: The Art, the Craft, the Life, by Richard Pilbrow on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrR1QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAQ Stage Lighting Design: A Practical Guide,  Neil Fraser, on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pXDT_sMBg2YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg A Practical Guide to Stage Lighting, By Steven Louis Shelley, on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ttNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA The Lighting Art: The Aesthetics of Stage Lighting Design, by Richard H.

Wolf, Dick Block, on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a theater production, lighting technicians work under the [[lighting designer]] and [[master electrician]]. In video, television, and film productions, lighting technicians work under the direction of the [[gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or chief lighting technician who takes their direction from the cinematographer. In live music, lighting technicians work under the lighting director. All heads of department report to the production manager.

==Responsibilities==
Lighting technicians are responsible for the movement and set up of various pieces of lighting equipment for separation of light and shadow or contrast, depth of field or  [[visual effects]]. Lighting Technicians may also lay electrical cables, wire fixtures, install color effects or image patterns, focus the lights, and assist in creating effects or programming sequences.

A lighting technician's work concerns safety of rigging and working with objects which can be very heavy and get very hot.

Some local unions such as the International Alliance of Television Stage Employees (IATSE) Hollywood chapter local #728, have been qualifying members by certification and recognition through the Entertainment Stage Technologies Association (ESTA)with their Entertainment Technicians Certification Program (ETCP). Basic skill sets are now standardized, and sets and stage are safer through this program.  

==Film lighting technician==
Officially called the '''electrical lighting technician''' (ELT), or the '''rigging electrical lighting technician''' ('''RELT'''), are also called or known as set lighting technicians, lamp operator, electrician, electric, spark or a juicer.  

The lighting technicians on a [[motion picture]] set handle all of the electrical needs as well as place and focus all of the lighting under the direction of the gaffer (chief lighting technician). 

Lighting techs also:

* Study the script and consult with the director to assess what lighting is required (Gaffer)
* Discuss production requirements with the camera operator (Cinematographer)
* Select lights and equipment to be used and organize any additional equipment (Gaffer)
* Set up, focus and operate light fixtures and equipment
* Control consoles and auxiliary equipment
* Choose and combine colors to achieve the desired effect(Cinematographer/Gaffer).
* Operate the lights during the performance
* Use manual or computer control consoles to control lighting throughout a production
* Use devices such as barn-doors, scrims and other attachments to control lighted areas
* Perform routine maintenance functions such as replacing lamps and damaged color filters or patterns and maintain lighting equipment in safe working conditions
* Explore new techniques and special effects
* Placement and focus of lighting fixtures for any given scene to be photographed.
* Distribution of power and work lights around the set and support areas (including [[actor]]'s trailers, portable production offices, catering, etc.).
* Management of [[electrical generators]].
* Providing [[electricity]] to all support services and departments on the set.

Also specialty duties are called upon the lighting technician such as...

* Follow spot operator
* Console/dimmer board operator
* Fixtures
* Manual/ poor mans operator

Hours of work also vary. For example, those employed by large television productions generally work more than 40 hours a week, 60 hours or more are not uncommon. Technicians and other crew members typically work a 12-hour day.

Depending on script requirements, stage and locations bring on their own requirements for lighting and effects. Out of state, or country to get the right look in a script is not uncommon. Location work always brings on its own challenges. Weather is always a factor when going to a location. Technicians are like scouts and have to be prepared for all kinds of weather as per the season.

Working conditions for lighting technicians vary a great deal from one job to another. Lighting technicians generally spend a lot of time on their feet and the pace of work can become hectic. Last-minute changes are often required and safety precautions must be observed when handling hot lamps, climbing ladders or working on high voltage electrical cables and equipment. Lighting technicians are routinely required to lift and carry the heaviest and more dangerous equipment compared to the other departments and office staff.

The film set electrical department hierarchy is as follows:

* Electrical lighting tech/ rigging electrical lighting tech.reports to the Best Boy or the Assistant Chief Lighting Technician (ACLT)whom reports to the Gaffer or the CLT, who is the head of the department. The Rigging Best Boy or Rigging Assistant Chief Lighting Technician reports to the Rigging Gaffer or the Chief Rigging Technician who is the head of the rigging, but not the department. Both rigging heads reports to the ACLT and CLT of the department. The Gaffer or the Chief Lighting Technician is the Head of the Set Lighting department and reports to the Director of Photography ([[Cinematographer]]) to make decisions on the creative lighting on the set (or on location), and is responsible for executing those decisions. A budget deciphered from the production schedule, script and vision mandates the types of lights and how to proceed with rigs.

==Stage lighting technician==
In live music performances, concerts, and other entertainment, stage lighting technicians  (also called a lighting tech, lighting operator, stage electrician, "sparky", "lampy", or "techie") set up lighting and make effects for live performances, concerts and any other show/production involving lighting. 

Duties include:
* Setting up and focusing lights
* Patching and or wiring up lights to dimmers or electronic control consoles
* Changing the set-up of lights during a performance or concert (e.g., changing color gels)
* Packing down lights after the show

The Stage lighting department hirearchy is as follows:

* Chief lighting Technician: works with the [[production manager]] to determine what effects need to be created, creates a plan to achieve the desired effects, and then directs the other members of the stage lighting department to set up the appropriate lighting equipment. This person can also be known as the House Electrician, Master Electrician or Venue Electrician.
* Lighting Board Programmer or [[Light board operator]]: Works with the chief lighting technician to program the lights using electronic or digital light programming equipment. The goal is to create light and color effects and sequences that enhance the onstage performance.
* Lighting Technician: sets up lights and wiring, and changes lights during a show, can also be called Stage Electrician.
* Stage lighting assistant: Works with the lighting technician to set up and patch or wire up lighting, also lugs gear to different areas of the stage area. These are sometimes utility technicians that may be shared between departments during a show day, depending on need and schedule.

'''''Monarch''''' is a British [[costume drama]] involving [[Henry VIII]]. It was written and directed by [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]] and released in 2000 at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]]. It was re-released in 2014 after the film negative, thought lost, was rediscovered.

==Plot==
''Monarch'' is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant.

In an ''Irish Post'' interview, Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balasundaram |first1=Nemesha |title=Rare TP McKenna film to be screened after original tapes recovered |url=https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/london-irish-director-reveals-archive-henry-viii-film-tapes-almost-lost-32166#comment-364005 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Irish Post |date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cast ==
[[T. P. McKenna]] plays Henry VIII, while [[Jean Marsh]] plays an amalgamation of his ex-wives. [[Peter Miles (English actor)|Peter Miles]] played a courtier to King Henry. [[James Coombes (actor)|James Coombes]] (known for his [[James Bond]] style role in the [[Cadbury]] chocolate [[Milk Tray]] advertisements popular on UK television)&lt;ref name="MilkTray"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milk Tray Man is back, and all because the lady loves it |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/11920070/Milk-Tray-Man-is-back-and-all-because-the-lady-loves....html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Telegraph |date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; played the King's personal protection guard.

==Production==
It was shot on [[35 mm film|35mm]] [[Kodak]] 5287 stock using [[Arriflex]] cameras. Principal photography commenced in October 1996 at [[Charlton House]] in south London, making it the only film about Henry VIII entirely shot in the borough where he was born: [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bishop |first1=Rachel |title="Tudor Whodunnit" filmed in Greenwich brought back to life |url=https://archive.fo/20141117163213/http://www.wharf.co.uk/2014/06/tudor-whodunnit-filmed-in-gree.html#selection-127.0-127.58 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Wharf (archived copy) |date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"&gt;{{cite news |title=Monarch back at Charlton House – film re-mastered for DVD and iTunes |url=https://www.weekender.co.uk/articles/uncategorised/monarch-back-charlton-house-film-re-mastered-dvd-itunes/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Weekender |date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] building served as the main location, with filming taking place inside and outside the house. The gardens were the backdrop for the opening title sequence. The Grand Salon and the Long Gallery featured heavily for the film’s dramatic scenes with Henry VIII. The house's clock tower was also utilised as the hiding place for Will, the ground-keeper's son, who hid from men who break into the house. Although set at night much of the filming took place during the day; black drapes were hung outside of the building to create a night effect.

In an interview with newspaper ''The Greenwich Visitor'' (page 5), Walsh discussed how he wanted his depiction of Henry VIII to be more grounded and less like those portrayals from Hollywood. He also discussed the difficulty of filming on a location and how the film benefited from using 35mm Kodak film stock.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/greenwichvisitor/docs/gv42.whole&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-release==
In 2014 a remastered version of ''Monarch'' was released following discovery of the original film negative, previously thought lost.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackenzie |first1=Steven |title=Lost joys: Directors reveal searches for missing movies |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26420152 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt; The remastered version premiered on 14 September 2014 at London's [[Tricycle Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Palmer-29Aug2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Jim |title=Critically acclaimed movie Monarch shot in Charlton by Greenwich-based John Walsh set for high definition re-release |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11441818.display/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=News Shopper |date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balasundaram"/&gt; Walsh discussed the issues around finding the lost negatives for ''Monarch'' and other lost projects with [[BBC Radio 2]]'s [[Janice Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Walsh - Spoken word session (18 April 2014) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01xn3p1 |website=BBC Radio 2 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
Restoration was completed at Premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422225752/http://www.premiercomms.com/work/2014/Monarch.php# |archive-date=22 April 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film scanning and restoration team worked closely with director John Walsh, re-mastering from the original 35mm colour camera negative after it was discovered in a vault almost 20 years after it was originally filmed. In an interview about the project for the [[BBC]], John Walsh explained:

:"When we located the project we found more than we bargained for with over 52 cans of various footage from film trims, cutting copies and work prints. We didn't know if the original camera negative would be amongst all of this haul. After a close examination we were delighted to find all of the original camera negative was there and in good shape for its age."&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

Every frame of film was scanned in high definition at Premier and had more than 10,000 particles removed by hand by the restoration team. A new sound mix was also created from the original elements in Premier’s in-house audio department. In an article with ''The Weekender'' in November 2017 John discussed the importance restoration and preservation of older films to future-protect film such as ''Monarch'':

: "It will give today’s audiences the chance to see the wonderful performance of [[Jean Marsh]] and the towering presence of [[T. P. McKenna]], regarded as one of the great of his generation and rightly so in one of his most outstanding performances. ...
:Some films are lost for all time. From [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films to TV episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and [[Tony Hancock]]. The Holy Grail of lost films for collectors is [[London After Midnight (film)|''London After Midnight'']]. The 1927 silent horror- mystery film starring [[Lon Chaney]] and produced by [[MGM]] has not been seen for almost 50 years.”&lt;ref name="Weekender-2017"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The film received strong reviews on its re-release in 2014 which were in contrast with the poor reviews in 2000. In 2000 Dennis Harvey wrote in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] that "''Monarch'' plays out an OK premise to results at once turgid and ridiculous." and describes McKenna's performance as "hammy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/monarch-1200464656/|title=Monarch|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=2000-10-23|work=Variety|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the ''[[Radio Times]]'' film critic Jeremy Aspinall called it "a fascinating, haunting little gem, with a richly nuanced performance from McKenna".&lt;ref name="Aspinall"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aspinall |first1=Jeremy |title=Monarch |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/cvvst7/monarch/ |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The film's realistic approach was noted by the [[BBFC]] who certified it a 15 on the basis that it "contains strong bloody violence".&lt;ref name="BBFC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Monarch |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/monarch-video |website=BBFC |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Monarch'' was released for the first time on [[DVD]] on 7 April 2014 by [[FremantleMedia]]. It included extras on the making of the film and the restoration process. A high definition version is also available to view on [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/monarch-2000/id849697291&lt;/ref&gt;

''DVD Compare'' said "The film features an extraordinary British cast, is well written, and is perfectly paced."&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Samuel |title=Monarch |url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3294 |website=DVD Compare |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Movie Waffler'' gave the film four stars for the main feature and four stars for the DVD extras, saying “McKenna is the beating heart of ''Monarch'', part wounded bear, part Augustus Gloop petulance.” It adds “This menacingly pessimistic view of British history and government is an immensely entertaining gothic melodrama, the creepy details that Walsh weaves into the film.”&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Poole |first1=Benjamin |title=Monarch |url=http://www.themoviewaffler.com/2017/11/dvd-review-monarch-2000.html |accessdate=21 August 2018 |work=The Movie Waffler |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5152">[[File:Wettnageln bei einer Hochzeit.jpg|thumb|Competitive Nailing during a wedding]]
'''Nagelbalken''' (German for '''nail beam''') is a competition in which participants compete against each other to drive nails into a wooden beam.  It can be found as a game of leisure at events and festivals, often for children and as a [[wedding]] custom.

== History ==
According to [[Florian Dering]], a museologist at the [[Munich Stadtmuseum]], the nail beam game as folk amusement has been around since the 1920s.&lt;ref name = "Dering-175"&gt;{{cite book| last = Dering| first = Florian| title = Volksbelustigungen: eine bildreiche Kulturgeschichte von den Fahr-, Belustigungs- und Geschicklichkeitsgeschäften der Schausteller vom 18. Jahrhundert bis zur Gegenwart| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cv4MAQAAMAAJ| year = 1986| publisher = F. Greno| isbn = 978-3-89190-005-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This driving of nails into dimensional lumber has been used by [[Showman|showmen]] and [[Charitable organization|charities]] to raise money, and also at weddings to have the newly married couple show their skills to the audience. 

Dering reports a series of administrative regulations: the vertical cross-section of the plank should be at least 12&amp;nbsp;cm by 12&amp;nbsp;cm, and have no knots or protruding branches.  Several hammers are used, each having a weight of at least 400&amp;nbsp;g and a handle length of at least 30&amp;nbsp;cm.  The nails provided should have a round (but not smooth) head, and be at least two inches long.  The nail bar is usually mounted at table height and secured to sawhorses by way of screw clamps.  Rarely, a tree trunk is used in place of the wooden beam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lacrossetribune.com/stories/news/autumn-sun-tabs-oktoberfest-festivities/article_b4c6b340-c3c5-5679-9a10-7c69aa602711.html |title=Autumn sun taps Oktoberfest festivities |first=Randy |last=Ericson |date=2001-09-29 |website=lacrossetribune.com |publisher=Lacrosse Tribune |access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Competitive nailing can be a solo game, for example at fairs, where driving the nail home in one to three blows wins a small prize, or as a contest between individuals or teams.

For [[Expo 2000]], the [[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|Bundesanstalt für Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitsmedizin]] in [[Dortmund]] presented the ''Exhibition Of The Labor World'' to demonstrate different aspects of workplace security&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Kilger, [http://www.dasa-dortmund.de/dasa/de/Szenografie/pdf/Szenografisches-Konzept?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 "Das szenografische Konzept der DASA"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in: DASA – Arbeitswelt Ausstellung, ''Kolloquium 2000: Szenografie in Ausstellungen und Museen'' (pdf) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  A Nagelbalken area was provided to demonstrate a person's physical competence&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite book| last1 = Kilger| first1 = Gerhard| last2 = Bieneck| first2 = Hans-Jürgen| title = Neue Qualitèat der Arbeit: wie wir morgen arbeiten werden| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n3SAmX_6kYwC&amp;pg=PA41| year = 2002| publisher = Campus Verlag| isbn = 978-3-593-37161-0| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Amoung many other things at the exhibition, the "Living And Working World" area in which the nail bar appeared dealt with the intellectual, psychological, physical, and social competence of people, which was implemented scenographically in four so-called "elementary spaces":  four cubic, monomaterially formed spaces that were meant to arouse the senses by way of light, sounds, artistic ciphers, and smells.

[[File:Wehrmann in Eisen 9931.JPG|thumb|Close-up of the Vienna ''Wehrmann im Eisen'' showing the nails]]
Craftsmen in German-speaking countries have driven nails into certain wooden shapes for luck for centuries, as in the case of the [[Stock im Eisen]] in [[Vienna]]. This art was used as a fund-raising tool during the [[First World War]], when the craft was adapted as a means of gathering donations for war-time charities, in the form of [[Nail Men]].  For a fee, a single nail could be partially driven into the figure.  When completed, the figure would be transformed from wood to metal.

The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'', "to tell", which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'', "knowing" or "skilled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative can be organized in a number of thematic or formal categories: [[non-fiction]] (such as definitively including [[creative non-fiction]], [[biography]], [[journalism]], [[transcript poetry]], and [[historiography]]); fictionalization of historical events (such as [[anecdote]], [[myth]], [[legend]], and [[historical fiction]]); and [[fiction]] proper (such as [[literature]] in [[prose]] and sometimes [[poetry]], such as [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s, and [[narrative poetry|narrative poems and song]]s, and imaginary narratives as portrayed in other textual forms, games, or live or recorded performances).

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]], and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]], and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[sequence (disambiguation)|sequence]] of events is presented. Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and conceptual.

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]&lt;/ref&gt; During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity, and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in [[noir fiction]] genre. An important part of [[narration]] is the [[narrative mode]], the set of methods used to communicate the narrative through a process narration (see also "Narrative Aesthetics" below).

Along with [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[argumentation]], and [[description]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. More narrowly defined, it is the [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the [[narrator]] communicates directly to the reader.

== Overview ==
A narrative is a telling of some true or fictitious event or connected sequence of events, recounted by a narrator to a narratee (although there may be more than one of each).  Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).  A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or discourse), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot).  The category of narratives includes both the shortest accounts of events (for example, ''the cat sat on the mat'', or a brief news item) and the longest historical or biographical works, diaries, travelogues, and so forth, as well as novels, ballads, epics, short stories, and other fictional forms.  In the study of fiction, it is usual to divide novels and shorter stories into first-person narratives and third-person narratives.  As an adjective, "narrative" means "characterized by or relating to storytelling":  thus '''narrative technique''' is the method of telling stories, and '''narrative poetry''' is the class of poems (including ballads, epics, and verse romances) that tell stories, as distinct from dramatic and lyric poetry.  Some theorists of narratology have attempted to isolate the quality or set of properties that distinguishes narrative from non-narrative writings:  this is called '''narrativity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human nature==
[[Owen Flanagan]] of Duke University, a leading consciousness researcher, writes, "Evidence strongly suggests that humans in all cultures come to cast their own identity in some sort of narrative form. We are inveterate storytellers."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Flanagan ''Consciousness Reconsidered'' 198&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are an important aspect of culture. Many works of art and most works of literature tell stories; indeed, most of the [[humanities]] involve stories.&lt;ref&gt;Humanities tell our stories | https://asunow.asu.edu/content/humanities-tell-our-stories-what-it-means-be-human&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories are of ancient origin, existing in [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Ancient China|Chinese]] and [[History of India|Indian]] cultures and their [[myths]]. Stories are also a ubiquitous component of human communication, used as [[parables]] and examples to illustrate points. [[Storytelling]] was probably one of the earliest forms of entertainment. As noted by Owen Flanagan, narrative may also refer to psychological processes in self-identity, memory and [[meaning-making]].

[[Semiotics]] begins with the individual building blocks of [[meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] called [[sign (semiotics)|signs]]; and [[semantics]], the way in which signs are combined into [[code (semiotics)|codes]] to transmit messages. This is part of a general [[communication]] system using both verbal and non-verbal elements, and creating a discourse with different
[[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] and forms.

In ''On Realism in Art'' [[Roman Jakobson]] argues that literature exists as a separate entity. He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]. It leads to a structural analysis of narrative and an increasingly influential body of modern work that raises important theoretical questions:
* What is ''text?''
* What is its role ([[culture]])?
* How is it manifested as art, cinema, theater, or literature?
* Why is narrative divided into different [[genre]]s, such as poetry, [[Wikipedian in Residence|short stories]], and novels?

== Literary theory ==
In literary theoretic approach, narrative is being narrowly defined as [[fiction-writing mode]] in which the narrator is communicating directly to the reader. Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Most [[poem]]s did not have a narrator distinct from the author.

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. It has been proposed that perspective and interpretive knowledge are the essential characteristics, while focalization and structure are lateral characteristics of the narrator.{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}

The role of literary theory in narrative has been disputed; with some interpretations like [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov's]] narrative model that views all narratives in a cyclical manner, and that each narrative is characterized by a three part structure that allows the narrative to progress. The beginning stage being an establishment of equilibrium--a state of non conflict, followed by a disruption to this state, caused by an external event, and lastly a restoration or a return to equilibrium--a conclusion that brings the narrative back to a similar space before the events of the narrative unfolded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todorov|first=Tzvetan|last2=Weinstein|first2=Arnold|date=1969|title=Structural Analysis of Narrative|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1345003|journal=NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction|volume=3|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1345003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of literary theory in narrative challenge the very role of literariness in narrative, as well as the role of narrative in literature. Meaning, narratives and their associated aesthetics, emotions, and values have the ability to operate without the presence of literature and vice versa. According to Didier Costa, the structural model used by Todorov and others is unfairly biased towards a Western interpretation of narrative, and that a more comprehensive and transformative model must be created in order to properly analyze narrative discourse in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coste|first=Didier|date=2017-06-28|title=Narrative Theory and Aesthetics in Literature|url=http://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-116|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framing also plays a pivotal role in narrative structure; an analysis of the historical and cultural contexts present during the development of a narrative is needed in order to more accurately represent the role of narratology in societies that relied heavily on oral narratives.

==Types of narrators and their modes==
A writer's choice in the narrator is crucial for the way a work of fiction is perceived by the reader. There is a distinction between [[first-person narrative|first-person]] and [[third-person narrative]], which [[Gérard Genette]] refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. Intradiagetic narrators are of two types: a homodiegetic narrator participates as a character in the story. Such a narrator cannot know more about other characters than what their actions reveal. A heterodiegetic narrator, in contrast, describes the experiences of the characters that appear in the story in which he or she does not participate.

Most narrators present their story from one of the following perspectives (called [[narrative mode]]s): first-person, or third-person limited or omniscient. Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story. A third-person omniscient narrator can be an animal or an object, or it can be a more abstract instance that does not refer to itself. For stories in which the context and the views of many characters are important, a third-person narrator is a better choice. However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator).

=== Multiple narrators ===
{{Main|Multiperspectivity}}
A writer may choose to let several narrators tell the story from different points of view. Then it is up to the reader to decide which narrator seems most reliable for each part of the story. It may refer to the style of the writer in which he/she expresses the paragraph written. See for instance the works of [[Louise Erdrich]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'' is a prime example of the use of multiple narrators. Faulkner employs [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to narrate the story from various perspectives.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haring|first=Lee|date=2004-08-27|title=Framing in Oral Narrative|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/172275|journal=Marvels &amp; Tales|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=229–245|doi=10.1353/mat.2004.0035|issn=1536-1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haring analyzes the use of framing in oral narratives, and how the usage of multiple perspectives provides the audience with a greater historical and cultural background of the narrative. She also argues that narratives (particularly myths and folktales) that implement multiple narrators deserves to be categorized as its own narrative genre, rather than simply a narrative device that is used solely to explain phenomena from different points of view.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between ''Thousand and One Nights'' and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural [[Ireland]], islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean, and African cultures such as [[Madagascar|Madagascar.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"I'll tell you what I'll do," said the smith. "I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. Thoughtfully composed stories have a number of aesthetic elements. Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community. {{technical statement|date=January 2013}}

== Psychological approach ==
{{see also|Narrative therapy}}
Within [[philosophy of mind]], the [[social sciences]] and various clinical fields including medicine, narrative can refer to aspects of human psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hevern, V. W. (2004, March). [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~hevern/narpsych/nrintro.html Introduction and general overview. Narrative psychology: Internet and resource guide]. [[Le Moyne College]]. Retrieved September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A personal narrative process is involved in a person's sense of [[Personal identity|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], and in the creation and construction of [[memories]]; it is thought by some to be the fundamental nature of the [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C (1992) [http://cogprints.org/266/ The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan McAdams |title=Redemptive Self: Narrative Identity in America Today |journal=The Self and Memory |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=95–116 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195176933.001.0001|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a729208757~db=all~jumptype=rss|isbn=9780195176933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of a coherent or positive narrative has been implicated in the development of [[psychosis]] and [[mental disorder]], and its repair said to play an important role in journeys of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gold E |title=From narrative wreckage to islands of clarity: Stories of recovery from psychosis |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=1271–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17872833 |pmc=1949240 }} Hyden, L.-C. &amp; Brockmeier, J. (2009). Health, Illness and Culture: Broken Narratives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative Therapy]] is a school of (family) [[psychotherapy]].

[[Illness narrative]]s are a way for a person affected by an illness to make sense of his or her experiences.&lt;ref name=Sulik&gt;{{cite book
|author=Gayle A. Sulik

|oclc= 535493589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically follow one of several set patterns: ''restitution'', ''chaos'', or ''quest'' narratives. In the [[restitution]] narrative, the person sees the illness as a temporary detour. The primary goal is to return permanently to normal life and normal health. These may also be called '''cure narratives'''. In the [[chaos narrative]], the person sees the illness as a permanent state that will inexorably get worse, with no redeeming virtues. This is typical of diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]: the patient gets worse and worse, and there is no hope of returning to normal life. The third major type, the [[quest narrative]], positions the illness experience as an opportunity to transform oneself into a better person through overcoming adversity and re-learning what is most important in life; the physical outcome of the illness is less important than the spiritual and psychological transformation. This is typical of the triumphant view of [[cancer survivorship]] in the [[breast cancer culture]].&lt;ref name=Sulik /&gt;

Personality traits, more specifically the [[Big Five personality traits]], appear to be associated with the type of language or patterns of word use found in an individual's self-narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, J. B., &amp; Peterson, J. B. (2009). Personality and language use in self-narratives. Journal of Research in Personality, 43, 524-527.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language use in self-narratives accurately reflects human personality. The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:

* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (i.e., few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

== Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated. Narratives thus lie at foundations of our cognitive procedures and also provide an explanatory framework for the social sciences, particularly when it is difficult to assemble enough cases to permit statistical analysis. Narrative is often used in [[case study research]] in the social sciences. Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry.

Sociologists Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein have contributed to the formation of a constructionist approach to narrative in sociology. From their book The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World (2000), to more recent texts such as Analyzing Narrative Reality (2009)and Varieties of Narrative Analysis (2012), they have developed an analytic framework for researching stories and storytelling that is centered on the interplay of institutional discourses (big stories) on the one hand, and everyday accounts (little stories) on the other. The goal is the sociological understanding of formal and lived texts of experience, featuring the production, practices, and communication of accounts.

=== Inquiry approach===
In order to avoid "hardened stories," or "narratives that become context-free, portable and ready to be used anywhere and anytime for illustrative purposes" and are being used as [[conceptual metaphor]]s as defined by linguist [[George Lakoff]], an approach called [[narrative inquiry]] was proposed, resting on the epistemological assumption that human beings make sense of [[random]] or complex multicausal experience by the imposition of story structures."&lt;ref name="conlea"&gt;Conle, C. (2000). Narrative inquiry: Research tool and medium for professional development. European Journal of Teacher Education, 23(1), 49–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Bell, J.S. (2002). Narrative Inquiry: More Than Just Telling Stories. TESOL Quarterly, 36(2), 207–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Human propensity to simplify data through a predilection for narratives over complex [[data]] sets typically leads to [[narrative fallacy]]. It is easier for the human mind to remember and make decisions on the basis of stories with meaning, than to remember strings of data. This is one reason why narratives are so powerful and why many of the classics in the humanities and social sciences are written in the narrative format. But humans read meaning into data and compose stories, even where this is unwarranted. In narrative inquiry, the way to avoid the narrative fallacy is no different from the way to avoid other error in scholarly research, i.e., by applying the usual methodical checks for [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and reliability in how data are collected, analyzed, and presented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Several criteria for assessing the validity of narrative research was proposed, including the objective aspect, the emotional aspect, the social/moral aspect, and the clarity of the story.

===Mathematical sociology approach ===
In mathematical sociology, the theory of comparative narratives was devised in order to describe and compare the structures (expressed as "and" in a [[directed graph]] where multiple causal links incident into a node are conjoined) of action-driven sequential events.&lt;ref name="abell1987"&gt;Abell. P. (1987) The Syntax of Social Life: the theory and Method of Comparative Narratives, Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell1993"&gt;Abell, P. (1993) Some Aspects of Narrative Method, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 18. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2009"&gt;Abell, P. (2009) A Case for Cases, Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation, Sociological Methods and Research, 32, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions. The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Narratives can be both abstracted and generalised by imposing an [[Abstract algebra|algebra]] upon their structures and thence defining [[homomorphism]] between the algebras. The insertion of action-driven causal links in a narrative can be achieved using the method of Bayesian narratives.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context". In the absence of sufficient comparative cases to enable statistical treatment of the causal links, items of evidence in support and against a particular causal link are assembled and used to compute the Bayesian likelihood ratio of the link. Subjective causal statements of the form "I/she did '''b''' because of '''a'''" and subjective [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]] "if it had not been for '''a''' I/she would not have done '''b'''" are notable items of evidence.&lt;ref name="abell2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="abell2011"&gt;Abell, P.

(2009) History, Case Studies, Statistics and Causal Inference, ''European Sociological review'', 25, 561–569&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Linearity is one of several narrative qualities that can be found in a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Gloag and David Beard, Musicology: The Key Concepts (New York: Routledge, 2009), 114&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by American musicologist, [[Edward Cone]], narrative terms are also present in the analytical language about music.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The different components of a fugue — subject, answer, exposition, discussion and summary — can be cited as an example.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several views on the concept of narrative in music and the role it plays.
One theory is that of Theodore Adorno, who has suggested that ‘music recites itself, is its own context, narrates without narrative’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt; Another, is that of Carolyn Abbate, who has suggested that ‘certain gestures experienced in music constitute a narrating voice’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_a" /&gt; Still others have argued that narrative is a semiotic enterprise that can enrich musical analysis.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag" /&gt;
The French musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez contends that ‘the narrative, strictly speaking, is not in the music, but in the plot imagined and constructed by the listeners’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b"&gt;Beard and Gloag, ''Musicology'', 116&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that discussing music in terms of [[narrativity]] is simply metaphorical and that the ‘imagined plot’ may be influenced by the work's title or other programmatic information provided by the composer.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; However, Abbate has revealed numerous examples of musical devices that function as narrative voices, by limiting music’s ability to narrate to rare ‘moments that can be identified by their bizarre and disruptive effect’.&lt;ref name="BeardGloag_b" /&gt; Various theorists share this view of narrative appearing in disruptive rather than normative moments in music.
The final word is yet to be said, regarding narratives in music, as there is still much to be determined.

==In cultural storytelling==
A narrative can take on the shape of a story, which gives listeners an entertaining and collaborative avenue for acquiring knowledge. Many cultures use [[storytelling]] as a way to record histories, myths, and values. These stories can be seen as living entities of narrative among cultural communities, as they carry the shared experience and history of the culture within them. Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. This promotes holistic thinking among native children, which works towards merging an individual and world identity. Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.&lt;ref&gt;Piquemal, N. 2003. From Native North American Oral Traditions to Western Literacy: Storytelling in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a number of indigenous stories are used to illustrate a value or lesson. In the [[Western Apache]] tribe, stories can be used to warn of the misfortune that befalls people when they do not follow acceptable behavior. One story speaks to the offense of a mother's meddling in her married son's life. In the story, the Western Apache tribe is under attack from a neighboring tribe, the Pimas. The Apache mother hears a scream. Thinking it is her son's wife screaming, she tries to intervene by yelling at him. This alerts the Pima tribe to her location, and she is promptly killed due to intervening in her son's life.&lt;ref&gt;Basso, 1984. "Stalking with Stories". Names, Places, and Moral Narratives Among the Western Apache.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous American cultures use [[Storytelling#Storytelling in indigenous cultures|storytelling]] to teach children the values and lessons of life. 
Although storytelling provides entertainment, its primary purpose is to educate.&lt;ref name="Hodge"&gt;Hodge, F., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C., &amp; Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities. Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). Traditional storytelling today: An international sourcebook. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the versions of [[La Llorona]] is used to teach children to make safe decisions at night and to maintain the morals of the community.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;

Narratives are considered by the Canadian Métis community, to help children understand that the world around them is interconnected to their lives and communities.&lt;ref name="Iseke"&gt;Iseke, Judy. (1998). Learning Life Lessons from Indigenous Storytelling with Tom McCallum.
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Métis community share the “Humorous Horse Story” to children, which portrays that horses stumble throughout life just like humans do.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt; [[Navajo]] stories also use dead animals as metaphors by showing that all things have purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Eder, D. J. (2007). Bringing Navajo Storytelling Practices into Schools: The Importance of Maintaining Cultural Integrity. Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.&lt;ref name="Iseke"/&gt;

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt; Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. American Indian community members emphasize to children that the method of obtaining knowledge can be found in stories passed down through each generation. Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.&lt;ref name="Hodge" /&gt;

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as organized chronologically; focused on a single coherent story; descriptive rather than analytical; concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and dealing with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp. 3–24, quote on 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers identify narratives with a type of explanation. [[Mark Bevir]] argues, for example, that narratives explain actions by appealing to the beliefs and desires of actors and by locating webs of beliefs in the context of historical traditions. Narrative is an alternative form of explanation to that associated with natural science.

Historians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and clever examples rather than statistical regularities.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History," ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133–49; Eric H. Monkkonen, "The Dangers of Synthesis," ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13643520|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy,|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521328462|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethics of retelling other people’s stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story’s purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit? Storytelling rights also implicates questions of consent, [[empathy]], and accurate representation. While storytelling—and retelling—can function as a powerful tool for [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[advocacy]], it can also lead to misunderstanding and exploitation.

[[Storytelling]] rights is notably important in the [[genre]] of [[personal experience]] narrative. Academic disciplines such as [[performance]], [[folklore]], [[literature]], [[anthropology]], [[Cultural studies|Cultural Studies]] and other [[social science]]s may involve the study of storytelling rights, often hinging on ethics.

'''''Nickelodeon Robot Wars''''' is a game show that aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from August 25, 2002 to October 6, 2002. Hosted by [[Dave Aizer]], the show was Nickelodeon's take on ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the popular and long-running robot-fighting game show. The show was canceled after one season, and subsequently aired on [[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids|Nickelodeon GAS]].

The series of six shows was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England in January 2002 at the same time as the second season of the ''Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors'' series shown on The New TNN American television network (now [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]]). Both shows featured American teams and robots flown to England for the filming.

==Tournaments==

Seven different tournaments took place over the six show series. Most of the tournaments aired within a single show, but a few spread out over multiple shows.

==Adjustments and changes==
The show featured robot competitors familiar to fans of the American series of Robot Wars, such as 'Rosie The Riveter' and 'The Revolutionist,' but the robot operators were all children associated with the teams.

To suit the younger audience, a few adjustments and changes were made to the arena and House Robots.
* All flame hazards, including the flame pit, fire jets and Sgt Bash's flamethrower, were disabled.
* Sir Killalot was renamed "Sir K," a name he was commonly referred to in the official UK Robot Wars magazine.
* The Pit Release Bumper was moved further down the arena wall, closer to the bottom-right CPZ.
* The language used was changed, with rougher language being disallowed.

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame
|title=Aaibare briljante reclame|publisher=Christianne Blogs|language=Dutch|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

==Awards==
In December 2013 [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] of John Doe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1041/Amsterdam/article/detail/2215767/2007/06/26/John-Doe-Amsterdam-grossiert-in-prijzen.dhtml|title=John Doe grossiert in prijzen|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date= 26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; got awarded with the highest Dutch advertising award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22154615/__Olli_wint_Gouden_Loeki__.html|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Telegraaf|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2664/Nieuws/article/detail/3565250/2013/12/19/Reclamespot-Olli-wint-Gouden-Loeki.dhtml|title=Olli wint Gouden Loeki|publisher=Volkskrant|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reclamewereld.blog.nl/reclameprijzen/2013/12/19/gouden-loeki-2013-asrolli-met-reclamebureau-john-doe|title=Gouden Loeki 2013: Olli met reclamebureau John Doe|publisher=Reclamewereld|language=Dutch|date= 19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Golden Loeki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovereclame.nl/gouden-loeki|title=Gouden Loeki Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this [[Advertising campaign|campaign]].

In 2013 Olli was used to help and save the Rotterdam zoo to generate money after the zoo lost government [[funding]]. In one year over 200.000 Olli's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/3555615/2013/12/03/Knuffelolifantje-Olli-reddende-engel-diergaarde-Blijdorp.dhtml

Ollimania is always involved with giving back to the community.  Ollimania works with local charity organizations as well as collaborating on common projects, fund‐raisings and social activities. In 2013 Ollimania saved a historic Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BG_7Lm-CIAE1Fj7.jpg:large|title=Olli de vredesduif|publisher=AD|date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Ollimania brings its stuffed toy characters to children hospitals, where he interact with little patients by distributing Ollimania presents, reading out Ollimania stories, taking pictures and even organizing birthday celebrations for the most needing ones and their families. On September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] donated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/10-09-2015/sophia-kinderziekenhuis-verwelkomt-olli-de-olifant|title=Sophia Kinderziekenhuis verwelkomt Olli de olifant|publisher=RTV Rijnmond|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge Olli [[statue]] to the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children’s Hospital]] in [[Rotterdam]].

'''''Panayiotou and others v Sony Music Entertainment (UK) Ltd.''''' ([1994] ChD 142) was a contract and entertainment law case before the [[High Court of Justice]]'s [[High Court of Justice#Chancery Division|Chancery Division]]. The plaintiff, entertainer [[George Michael]], argued that his recording contract constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. Michael alleged that the defendant had failed to promote his album ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' with due vigour as punishment when the artist decided to downplay his status as a sex symbol. Michael described his situation as "professional slavery" because his contract required that he produce music and cede the copyright to Sony for many years, leaving him no control over how the music would be marketed nor placing a reciprocal requirement that the label invest in promotion. Had the case succeeded, it might have curtailed the practice of signing artists to multi-album contracts. The court wholly rejected the claims.

==Background==
Georgios Panayiotou, known professionally as George Michael, signed with [[Innervision Records]] in 1982 at the age of eighteen as part of the then relatively unknown pop duo [[Wham!]].&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1993 /&gt; Innervision were distributed by [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. In 1984 this contract was nullified as part of a legal compromise wherein Wham! were obligated to produce up to eight new albums for CBS Records; the label and the contract were acquired by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt; Following Wham!'s success and subsequent break up, Michael renegotiated a new eight-album deal with Sony as a solo artist in 1988.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt; This deal was further renegotiated in 1990 to reflect Michael's superstar status, achieving terms comparable to similarly high-grossing artists.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt; Michael's first solo album, [[Faith (George Michael album)|''Faith'']], was released in 1987 and had sold 14 million copies by the time suit was filed; his second solo album, ''[[Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1]]'' was released in 1990 and had sold 5 million copies.&lt;ref name=NYT1994 /&gt; ''Listen Without Prejudice'' represented a new direction for Michael, downplaying the sex symbol status he had cultivated with Wham! in favour of a more reserved identity purely as a serious musician; he decided not to place his highly recognisable image on the album cover and declined to appear in promotional videos. Michael alleged that Sony under-promoted his new album in response to these decisions. He further charged that the contract restricting him from seeking a new label and prevented him from managing his professional image as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep1993 /&gt; Michael described this imbalance of power and his long-term lack of control over his career as "professional slavery".&lt;ref name=NYT1994 /&gt;

It was common practice in the recording industry to sign many emerging artists like Wham!, banking that long-term profits from the few commercial successes would cover the losses from promoting the remainder. A decision holding Michael's contract unenforceable could have dramatically reduced the expected return on investment for signing and promoting an emerging artist, leading to fears that the practice would end. Michael argued that the structure of the industry concentrated power in too few hands, and that these companies competed by selling music, but not in the terms offered to new artists. This led to an imbalance of power, where the artist was contractually obligated to produce a set number of albums of acceptable quality and cede copyright to the label, but the label did not bear a reciprocal obligation to market and promote the product, in accordance with the artist's wishes or otherwise.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep1993 /&gt;

Michael was advanced a sum of £1 million in February 1992 under the terms of the 1990 contract. This amount was returned to Sony in August of the same year in preparation for filing suit in October.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-report /&gt;

==Decision==
Michael filed suit before the [[Chancery Division]] on 30 October 1992, and Justice Jonathan Parker issued a ruling on 1 June 1994. The plaintiff's claims were wholly rejected. Parker held that Michael's contracts were reasonable and fair,&lt;ref name=Nordenfelt /&gt; especially in consideration of his access to expert legal advice, several renegotiations, and terms comparable to the industry standard for an artist of his commercial success.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-appeal /&gt; There were five prongs to the justice's dismissal:
*the case was indeed such that the doctrine of restraint of trade would be applicable;
*the 1984 agreement was a compromise in good faith and the conditions obtaining there would pertain to all subsequent renegotiations: there is a legitimate public interest in upholding such a compromise, and the suit fails at the initial hurdle;
*leaving aside the origin of the 1988 agreement, its provisions were justifiable: the label has a legitimate and enforceable ''recoupment interest'' in an exclusive contract of some duration;
*restraint of trade under Article 85 of the [[Treaty of Rome]] establishing the European Community concerns trade between member states, and was held not to apply; Article 222 governing property ownership, including intellectual property, would have superseded in any case;
*by activating its terms in requesting an advance in 1992, Michael affirmed the 1988 agreement.&lt;ref name=TMLR1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=indep-report /&gt;

In July 1995, Sony sold the contract to rival record companies Virgin Records and DreamWorks Records.

The '''Philadelphia Sphas''', also stylized '''SPHAs''' or '''SPHAS''', were an American basketball franchise that existed in professional, semi-professional, and exhibition forms. They played their home games in the ballroom of Philadelphia's Broadwood Hotel. The team's name is an [[acronym]], derived from '''S'''outh '''P'''hiladelphia '''H'''ebrew '''A'''ssociation (the group that initially funded the team), and the team's players, at least in its earlier years, were primarily Jewish. Future [[Philadelphia Warriors]] owner [[Eddie Gottlieb]] founded the team as an amateur group shortly after he and some close friends graduated from high school, and the team evolved into a professional unit that played in many leagues around the Philadelphia area and the East Coast, most notably the Eastern Basketball League and the [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]], between which the Sphas won 10 championships. The Sphas won a total of 12 championships, their first two coming from the early Philadelphia League and Philadelphia Basket Ball League.

With the 1946 advent of the [[Basketball Association of America]], the immediate predecessor of the NBA, the ABL became a minor-league, and the Sphas would remain there as a semi-professional team until 1949. Gottlieb sold the team in 1950 to [[Red Klotz]], a former Spha. 1949 would be the last year the Sphas were affiliated with a league, but thanks to Gottlieb's friendship with [[Abe Saperstein]], president and owner of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], the Sphas lived on as one of the exhibition teams that the Globetrotters would play, although they would retain only the franchise name, not the Jewish makeup of the team.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite popular wisdom, the Sphas did not directly evolve into the [[Washington Generals]]. Instead, Saperstein had asked Klotz to create a separate exhibition team because the Sphas had beaten the Globetrotters on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://joeposnanski.com/a-basketball-carol/|title=A Basketball Carol|date=2011-01-05|work=Joe Posnanski|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball's Greatest Jewish Team|last=Stark|first=Douglas|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; After creating the Generals, Klotz sold the Sphas to one of his players, Pete Monska, who coached the team "for a year or two until it disbanded [in October 1959.]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Sphas played their last game as the original team on October 17, 1959, losing to the Globetrotters in a double-header exhibition game. The Sphas were then reconstituted as the Baltimore Rockets, another Globetrotters exhibition team.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:SPHAS BASKETBALL TEAM SIGN ON BROAD STREET.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] marker.]]

===Origins as YMHA===
The Sphas' existence began in 1917 as an amateur team by neighborhood friends [[Eddie Gottlieb]], Harry Passon, and Hughie Black, who wanted to keep their high school championship team together.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The team's [[1917-18 Philadelphia Sphas season|first season]] took place in the American League of Philadelphia, a minor league that comprised six area teams. They were sponsored by the Young Men's Hebrew Association of South Philadelphia, and were called Philadelphia YMHA for that season. The team turned in a 4–11 record, tied for last in the league that year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Stark, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After that season, the YMHA withdrew its support for the team, citing dissatisfaction with the game's violent nature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Change to Sphas and "Wandering Jews" period===
After losing their sponsorship from the YMHA, Gottlieb, Passon, and Black approached the South Philadelphia Hebrew Association about sponsoring the team. The association agreed to sponsor the men, and provided funding for uniforms to the team. The new uniforms featured the acronym SPHA in Hebrew (ספהא) across the front. Again, their sponsorial relationship was short-lived, as the SPHA withdrew their sponsorship shortly after for an unspecified reason.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Stark, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The men had better financial solvency this time around, as they opened a sporting goods store, calling it P.G.B. Sporting Goods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the store, they created new uniforms, but kept the Sphas moniker as a way of paying tribute to their upbringing. Douglas Stark, author of ''The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball's Greatest Jewish Team'', noted that "[f]or a number of years, the team was known as the Wandering Jews, because the team did not have its own home court."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Stark, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The team continued to play in the American League of Philadelphia after losing their partnership with the SPHA, and played in two different leagues during the 1922–23 season: The Manufacturer's League, containing teams from area companies, and the Philadelphia League, which consisted of teams from the greater Philadelphia area, a number of them religious.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In their single season in the Manufacturer's League, the team (known as Philadelphia Passon, Gottlieb, Black since they competed through Passon and Black's sporting goods store) turned in an overall 8–6 record, finishing 3rd in the first half of that season and 6th (out of 8) in the second half.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first season in the Philadelphia League was a disappointing one, turning in an 8–11 record and finishing 2nd in the first half of the season, but last in the second half at 1–8.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphas' next season in the Philadelphia League would prove more fruitful (due in part to the increased number of games), as the Sphas turned in a 25–15 record, overcoming a first half slump of 14–13 (5th out of 8) to finish first in the second half of the season with an 11–3 record. They went on that year to defeat the Tri-Council Caseys 2–0 for their first championship.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early championships, success against barnstorming teams, first ABL stint and name change===
For the 1924–25 season, the Philadelphia League reconstituted itself as the Philadelphia Basket Ball League, dropping the number of teams in the league to six.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Sphas continued a strong spate of play, finishing 1st in the first half of the season, and third in the second half. They would go on to be repeat champions that season, winning 2–1 again over Tri-Council.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Due to the success of the Sphas against teams in the Philadelphia area, and frustration with playing in the "poorly managed" Eastern League in 1924–25, owner Eddie Gottlieb set up games against professional teams from the newly-formed [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Stark, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphas played a six-game stretch against the [[Brooklyn Arcadians]], [[Fort Wayne Caseys]], [[Cleveland Rosenblums]], [[Washington Palace Five]], and a team from New York's Metropolitan League, the Paterson Legionaires. The Sphas won five out of six games in this series, and Gottlieb subsequently scheduled games against two top [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] teams of the day, the [[Original Celtics]] and [[New York Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Sphas defeated the Original Celtics 2–1 and swept the Rens, 2–0. The team's victories over these top barnstorming teams gave them increased notability in the burgeoning professional basketball community.&lt;ref&gt;Radel. Abe.“South Philadelphia Hebrew Association,” in The Reach Official Basket Ball Guide, 1926–27, ed. William Phillips (Philadelphia: A. J. Reach, 1926), 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Riding the wave of victories his team achieved against the ABL and barnstorming teams, Gottlieb entered the Sphas in the ABL, rechristening them the Philadelphia Warriors. During their two years in the ABL as the Warriors, the team performed moderately well, finishing third (14–7) and then fourth (10–11) in the 1926–27 season.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Stark, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1927–28 season, the ABL split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). The Warriors played in the Eastern Division and finished third with a 30–21 record. This allowed them entry into the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Celtics&lt;ref&gt;This team was in reality the [[Original Celtics]], who replaced the Brooklyn Arcadians. They took the name Brooklyn Celtics, then changed to New York Celtics for the 1927 season.&lt;/ref&gt; 2–0.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">The best-known '''pleorama''' was a 19th-century moving [[Panoramic painting|panorama]] entertainment where the viewers sat in a rocking boat while panoramic views on painted canvas rolled past. The word has sometimes been used for other entertainments or innovations.

Architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]] introduced a pleorama in [[Breslau]] in 1831 with scenes of the [[Bay of Naples]] on both sides of 24 "voyagers" sitting in a wooden boat floating in a pool of water. The illusion was enhanced by light and sound effects: the boatman singing, [[Vesuvius]] erupting. Writer/artist [[August Kopisch]] was involved in designing the hour-long show.

Carl Wilhelm Gropius, who had a [[diorama]] exhibit in [[Berlin]], took over management of this pleorama in 1832, and there was also a pleorama of a journey along the river [[Rhine]]. 

The Swiss writer Bernard Comment, among others, has pointed out the similarities between Langhans' pleorama and the ambitious [[mareorama]] at the 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Exhibition]].

A similar idea was used for a [[London]] ''padorama'' in 1834. Spectators were seated in [[railway]] carriages to watch a moving panorama of scenes visible from the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

In 1850s [[Finland]] the name ''pleorama'' was given to shows which presented historic scenes and panoramic views using glass, but posters for these do not mention anything resembling Langhans' boat concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibbild.abo.fi/nojen/ Posters in Swedish for pleoramas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name ''pleorama'' was coined from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] elements. Like other 19th century novelties ending in ''-orama'' - [[diorama]] and [[cyclorama]], for instance - the second half of the word has the sense of 'something seen'. The ''pleo-'' part here is understood to come from a Greek word meaning 'float' which applies to Langhans' boat in water idea. ''Pleorama'' is also the 21st century name of an innovative "floating house".

The '''''praetexta''''' or '''''fabula praetexta''''' was a genre of Latin [[tragedy]] introduced at Rome by [[Gnaeus Naevius]] in the third century B.C. It dealt with historical Roman figures, in place of the conventional [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]. Subsequent writers of ''praetextae'' included [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]]. The name refers to the ''toga praetexta'', the official dress of Roman magistrates.

All [[Roman Republic]]an tragedies are now lost. From the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] only one play has survived, the [[Octavia (play)|''Octavia'']].

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1992) ''New Perspectives on Classroom Drama''. Nelson Thornes Ltd., London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.'' Trans-Atlantic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neelands, Jonothan and Tony Goode (2000) ''Structuring Drama Work: A handbook of available forms in theatre and drama''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Cecily (1995) ''Drama Worlds: A Framework for Process Drama (The Dimensions of Drama)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, John (1992) ''The Process of Drama: Negotiating Art and Meaning.'' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999. Unravelling the Mystery: A Study of Reflection-in-Action in Process Drama Teaching.Thesis (PhD Doctorate), Griffith University, Brisbane. Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

It developed a set of dramatic and theatrical [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of [[Realism (arts)|a broader artistic movement]], it includes [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Socialist realism]].

Russia's first professional playwright, [[Aleksey Pisemsky]], along with [[Leo Tolstoy]] (in his ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' of 1886), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia. A new type of acting was required to replace the declamatory conventions of the [[well-made play]] with a technique capable of conveying the speech and movements found in the domestic situations of [[everyday life]]. This need was supplied by the innovations of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], founded by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Hartnoll, Phyllis |editor2=Found, Peter |title=The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-282574-7 | pages=341, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subtle expression of emotion in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' through everyday small-talk had initially gone unappreciated in a more traditionally conventional production in St Petersburg, a new staging by the Moscow Art Theatre brought the play and its author, as well as the company, immediate success.&lt;ref name=Esslin-2003&gt;Esslin (2003), pp. 353-356&lt;/ref&gt; A logical development was to take the revolt against theatrical artifice a step further in the direction of naturalism, and Stanislavski, especially in his production of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', helped this movement achieve international recognition.&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003/&gt; The Moscow Art Theatre's ground-breaking productions of plays by Chekhov, such as ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in turn influenced [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of [[actor training]] that is particularly well-suited to psychological realism.

19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, "is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s" with the "middle-period" work of the Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been "enormously influential."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[opera]], ''[[verismo]]'' refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the Naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. 

== Added to Realism ==
3D details were added by 1800. By 1850 settings, costumes and details became historically accurate and had more logic to the plays.

==Stanislavski's distinction==
As part of a strategic argument in his day, Stanislavski used the term "psychological realism" to distinguish his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of acting from his own [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] early stagings of the plays of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and others. Jean Benedetti argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturalism, for him, implied the indiscriminate reproduction of the surface of life. Realism, on the other hand, while taking its material from the real world and from direct observation, selected only those elements which revealed the relationships and tendencies under the surface. The rest was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As used in critical literature today, however, the term Naturalism has a broader scope than that, within which all of Stanislavski's work falls. In this broader sense, Naturalism or "psychological realism" is distinct both from [[Socialist realism]] and the critical realism developed by the [[epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">'''Residual media''' refers to media that are not [[new media]], but are nonetheless still prevalent in society. The term is offered as an alternative to the term [[old media]]. Residual media attempts to act as a corrective to the idea that when media become old, they absolutely become obsolete, or “dead media.” Residual media “reveals that, ultimately, new cultural phenomena rely on encounters with the old”.&lt;ref&gt;Acland, Charles R. ''Residual Media'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2007), Backcover.&lt;/ref&gt; While old media can, and often does, become obsolete, they do not die. Instead, old media persist in our culture—either in storage units or landfills, or as cultural capital for niche groups—or they can be moved to other parts of the world and other cultures. Regardless of where they end up, the media is not dead, they are still very much living, changing, and evolving. Residual media helps show that the transition between old and new media is not simplistic, well-defined, or sweeping. Examples of residual media include [[film cameras]] and [[film]], [[record players]] and [[LP records]], [[radio]], [[letter (message)|letters]], and [[postcard]]s, etc.

==History==
Residual media was first defined in the edited collection ''Residual Media'' by [[Charles R. Acland]]. The term itself stems from [[Raymond Williams]]' study of culture’s dominant, emergent, and residual forms. The residual forms, Williams says, are “experiences, meanings and values which cannot be expressed in terms of the dominant culture,” but “are nevertheless lived and practiced on the basis of residue—cultural as well as social—of some previous social formation”.&lt;ref name="Raymond 41"&gt;Williams, Raymond. "Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory." ''Problems in Materialism and Culture'' (New York: Verso, 1973/1980), 41&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to media, the dominant culture would be new media, while the residual would be the forms of media that have come before, but are still in use regardless of the new supplanting them. Williams’s definition of the residual is also important because it emphasizes that these old forms of media are “still active in the cultural process, not only and often not at all as an element of the past, but as an effective element of the present”.&lt;ref name="Raymond 41"/&gt; Residual media, though antiquated or seen as lesser than the new media, still exist in the present and still affect that which is dominant. The way we interact with the old still informs the way we interact with the new, and the new informs the way we interact with the old. The idea of residual media is closely related to [[Jay David Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin]]'s theory of [[Remediation (Marxist theory)]].

==Examples==
*'''The [[Vinyl revival]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Since 2006, sales of vinyl records, a form of residual media, have been rising while the sales of CDs, new media, have been dropping. In 2012, vinyl sales in the [[United States]] went up 17.7%, while CD sales dropped 13.5%; in the [[United Kingdom]] vinyl sales jumped 15.3%, while CD sales dropped 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/the-turntable-strikes-back/ Digital Trends - The Turntable Strikes Back]&lt;/ref&gt; Digital downloads are still the most utilized method of purchasing music, but vinyl records still remain culturally relevant.
*'''[[Skeuomorph]]ism'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Basalla|first=George|title=The Evolution of Technology|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-29681-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital skeuomorphs found in places like [[Evernote]], which showed physical notebooks, or Apple iOS6's Notes app, which looked liked a lined reporter's notebook, show how "old media" still exert a pressure on the new. (For more examples see [[Skeuomorphs in popular culture]])

'''Retrogaming''', also known as '''classic gaming''' and '''old school gaming''', is the playing or collecting of older [[computer game|personal computer]], [[video game console|console]], and [[arcade game|arcade]] video games in contemporary times. Usually retrogaming is based upon systems that are obsolete or discontinued.

Retrogaming has three main activities; vintage retrogaming, retrogaming emulation, and ported retrogaming. Vintage retrogaming includes games that are played on the original hardware. [[emulator|Emulation]] involves newer systems simulating old gaming systems, while ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations. Additionally, the term could apply to a newer game, but with features similar to those of older games, such as an "retro [[Role-playing video game|RPG]]" which features turn-based combat and an isometric camera perspective.

Participants in the hobby are sometimes known as retrogamers in the United Kingdom, while the terms "classic gamers" or "old school gamers" are more prevalent in the United States. Similarly, the games are known as retrogames, classic games, or old school games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/old-school-iphone-games-2011-10] GOING RETRO: 14 Old School Games You Can Play On Your iPhone Right Now&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrogaming has existed since the early years of the video game industry, but was popularized with the popularity of the Internet and emulation technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Retrogaming as Nostalgia by D. S. Heineman|url = http://gamescriticism.org/articles/heineman-1-1/|website = Journal of Games Criticism|date = 2014-01-22|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Heineman, David|last = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are nostalgia for different eras,&lt;ref name=NGenFit&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Revival of the Fittest |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=36-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that older games are more innovative and original,&lt;ref name=NGenFit/&gt; and the simplicity of the games that requires less hours of gameplay.

Retrogaming and [[retrocomputing]] have been described as [[Digital preservation|preservation]] activity and as aspects of the [[remix culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/38392/230.pdf?sequence=4|title=Retrocomputing as Preservation and Remix|authors=Yuri Takhteyev, Quinn DuPont|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|quote=''This paper looks at the world of retrocomputing, a constellation of largely non-professional practices involving old computing technology. Retrocomputing includes many activities that can be seen as constituting “preservation.” At the same time, it is often transformative, producing assemblages that “remix” fragments from the past with newer elements or joining together historic components that were never combined before. While such “remix” may seem to undermine preservation, it allows for fragments of computing history to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages also provides space for alternative “situated knowledges” and histories of computing, which can sometimes be quite sophisticated. Recognizing such alternative epistemologies paves the way for alternative approaches to preservation.''|date=2013 |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-26 |work=iConference 2013 Proceedings (pp. 422–432). doi:10.9776/13230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games ==
Retro games are generally those produced from the 1970s to early 2000s, and can include [[video game]]s for systems and consoles from the [[First generation of video game consoles|1st]] through [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|6th]] generations of [[Video game console|video game consoles]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40427838|title=Retro gaming: Why players are returning to the classics|last=Scott|first=Jennifer|date=2017-06-28|website=[[BBC]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726221024/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40427838|archive-date=2017-07-26|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[personal computer game]]s for [[retrocomputing]] platforms. [[Arcade game]]s are also popular, and were frequently attributed to individual programmers. The transition between the retro and modern era coincides with the shift from 2D to 3D games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Retro-gaming, what is it?

As well as playing games, a subculture of retrogaming has grown up around the [[Video game music|music in retro games]].

== Retrogaming methods ==
In the wake of increasing nostalgia and the success of retro-compilations in the fifth, sixth, and seventh generations of consoles, retrogaming has become a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] in modern games, as well. Modern retrogames impose limitations on color palette, resolution, and memory well below the actual limits of the hardware in order to mimic the look of older hardware. These may be based on a general concept of retro, as with ''[[Cave Story]]'', or an attempt to imitate a specific piece of hardware, as with ''[[La Mulana]]'' and its [[MSX]] color palette.

This concept, known as Deliberate Retro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Deliberately Retro | publisher =giantbomb.com | url =https://www.giantbomb.com/deliberately-retro/3015-996/ | accessdate =2017-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and NosCon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =NosCon | publisher =giantbomb.com | url =https://www.giantbomb.com/noscon/3015-4537/ | accessdate =2017-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began to gain traction thanks in part to the independent gaming scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =9 indie games shamelessly inspired by retro ancestors | publisher =gamesradar.com | url =http://www.gamesradar.com/9-indie-games-shamelessly-inspired-retro-ancestors/ | accessdate =2017-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the short development time was attractive and commercial viability was not a concern. Major publishers have embraced modern retrogaming with releases such as ''[[Mega Man 9]]'', an attempt to mimic NES hardware; ''[[Retro Game Challenge]]'', a compilation of new games on faux-NES hardware; and Sega's ''[[Fantasy Zone II]]'' remake, which uses emulated [[System 16]] hardware running on [[PlayStation 2]] to create a 16-bit reimagining of the 8-bit original.

=== Vintage retrogaming ===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=|image2=|image3=Used Super Famicom consoles.jpg|width=220||caption3=Used Super Famicom consoles and games sold in like new condition in Akihabara. Used games are sold with or without packaging.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-09-12-crippled-by-nostalgia-the-fraud-of-retro-gaming&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vintage retrogaming involves players collecting the original hardware, cartridges, and discs the video games were originally released on.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Retrogaming?|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-retrogaming.htm|website = wiseGEEK|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware collected includes arcade systems, old home consoles, and their cartridges and discs. Some of these collectables can be fairly expensive and hard to find, limiting the access to these old games.&lt;ref&gt;http://igcritic.com/what-happened-to-classic-video-game-packaging/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.racketboy.com/retro/nintendo/snes/the-rarest-and-most-valuable-super-nintendo-snes-games&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority, however, sell for much less than their retail price.&lt;ref name=NGenReal&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Real Thing |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of vintage retrogaming has led to the circulation of pirated copies of retro games, which are generally considered to lack the collector value of the original cartridges and discs.&lt;ref name=NGenReal/&gt;

=== Retrogaming emulation ===
{{Main|Video game console emulator|l1=Video game emulator}}

Retrogaming emulation involves older gaming systems being emulated on new hardware. It bypasses the need to collect old consoles and original games. ROMs, read only memory files, are taken directly from the original cartridge or disc from third parties. They are then typically put online through file sharing sites and played via emulators on modern hardware.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are also often sold as re-releases, typically in compilations containing multiple games running on emulation software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Classic Game Collections |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=40-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since emulation is a more accessible way to take part in retrogaming, it helped to popularize and expand on the hobby.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ported retrogaming ===
Ported retrogaming involves old games being played on new systems, just as emulation. It differs from emulation because the games are being rewritten for the new system and don't use the original ROM files.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ported games are available through official collections, console-based downloads, and [[Handheld TV game|plug and play systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ported retrogaming is comparatively rare, since emulation is a much easier and more accurate method of running retro games on modern hardware.

==== Remakes ====
{{Main|Video game remake}}
Modern retrogaming may sometimes be more broadly applied to games that feature retro-style designs and reimaginings with more modern graphics. These enhanced [[Remake (software)|remakes]] include ''[[Pac-Man: Championship Edition]]'', ''[[Space Invaders Extreme]]'', ''[[Super Mega Worm]]'', ''[[3D Dot Game Heroes]]''. Some are based directly upon the enhanced emulation of original games, as with Nintendo's ''[[NES Remix]]''.

[[File:Paku-paku4-dos.png|thumb|Screenshot of ''Paku Paku'', a ''[[Pac-Man]]'' remake that targets the obscure and seldom used 160×100×16 mode of the [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] [[graphic card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathshadow.com/pakuPaku |title=Paku Paku – A game for early PC/MS-DOS Computers |first=Jason |last=Knight |publisher=deathshadow.com |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When remakes are created by an individual or a group of enthusiasts without commercial motivation, such games sometimes are also called [[fangames]]. These are often motivated by the phenomenon of [[abandonware]], which is the discontinuation of sales and support by the original producers. Examples of [[fan-made]] remakes are ''[[King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown (AGD Interactive)|King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown]]'', ''[[King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones]]'', and ''[[Freeciv]]''.

The nostalgia-based revival of older game styles has also been accompanied by the development of the modern [[Chiptunes#Today|chiptune genre]] of game music. Chiptunes are characterized by severe limitations of sound imposed by the author's self-restriction to using only the original sound chips from 8-bit or 16-bit games. These compositions are featured in many retro-style modern games and are popular in the [[demoscene]].

==== Re-releases ====
With the new possibility of the [[digital distribution]] in mid-2000 the commercial distribution of old classical game titles became feasible again as deployment and storage costs dropped significantly: {{Quote|'' [...] we can put something up on Steam [a digital distributor], deliver it to people all around the world, make changes. We can take more interesting risks.[...] Retail doesn’t know how to deal with those games. On Steam there’s no shelf-space restriction. It’s great because they’re a bunch of old, orphaned games''|[[Gabe Newell]]|[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]&lt;ref name=newell2007&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/11/21/rps-exclusive-gabe-newell-interview/|title=RPS Exclusive: Gabe Newell Interview |date=2007-11-22 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |first=John |last=Walker |quote=''The worst days [for game development] were the cartridge days for the NES. It was a huge risk – you had all this money tied up in silicon in a warehouse somewhere, and so you’d be conservative in the decisions you felt you could make, very conservative in the IPs you signed, your art direction would not change, and so on. Now it’s the opposite extreme: we can put something up on Steam, deliver it to people all around the world, make changes. We can take more interesting risks.[...] Retail doesn’t know how to deal with those games. On Steam [a digital distributor] there’s no shelf-space restriction. It’s great because they’re a bunch of old, orphaned games.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A digital distributor specialized in bringing old games out of abandonware is ''[[GOG.com]]'' (formerly called ''Good Old Games'') who started 2008 to search for copyright holders of classic games to re-release them legally and [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free.&lt;ref name="arspreview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/09/first-look-gog-revives-classic-pc-games-for-download-age.ars |title=First look: GOG revives classic PC games for download age |accessdate=2012-12-27 |first=Frank|last=Caron |date=2008-09-09 |publisher=Ars Technica |quote=''[...] [Good Old Games] focuses on bringing old, time-tested games into the downloadable era with low prices and no DRM.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable online platforms for classic video game re-releases include Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] and Sony's [[List of PlayStation Store games|PlayStation Network]].

Mobile application developers have been purchasing the rights and licensing to re-release vintage arcade games on iOS and Android operating systems. Some publishers are creating spinoffs to their classic games, keeping the core gameplay while adding new features, levels, and styles of play.

==== Plug-and-play systems ====
[[Handheld TV game|Plug-and-play systems]] have been released or licensed by companies such as [[Atari Flashback|Atari]], Sega, and [[NES Classic Edition|Nintendo]]. These systems include stand-alone game libraries and plug directly into the user’s television.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Retrogaming community ==
[[File:Logo - The Art of Video Games - Smithsonian American Art Museum.jpg|thumb|''The Art of Video Games'' premiered at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2012.]]The video game industry has an active audience, including the retrogaming sector. The retrogaming community has both online and physical spaces where retrogames are discussed, collected, and played.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Online retrogaming community ===
There are several websites and online forums devoted to both retrogaming and video games in general. The content on these online platforms typically includes reviews of older games, interviews with developers, fan-made content, game walkthroughs, and message boards for discussions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many gameplay videos posted online feature attempts at breaking [[speedrun]] or [[Score_(game)#High_score|high score]] records.

=== Fighting game community ===
The competitive [[Fighting game community]] traces its legacy from old-school arcades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|title=Why the fighting game community is color blind|first=Mitch|last=Bowman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[fighting game]]s have continued to receive arcade releases after the end of the arcade era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2010/10/brief-history-of-2d-fighting-games.html|title=A Brief History of 2D Fighting Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Face-to-face competition of ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' has been featured in the [[Evolution Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shoryuken.com/2015/06/05/evo-2015-super-street-fighter-ii-turbo-side-tournament-announced-registration-now-live/|title=Evo 2015 Super Street Fighter II Turbo Side Tournaments Unveiled, Registration Now Live|first=Ian|last=Walker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibitions ===
There are several events that retrogamers can take part in. Exhibits typically include vendors, retrogames available to play, tournaments, costumes, and live music, such as the Vancouver Retro Gaming Expo, run by Phase 3 events. This event has been occurring annually since March 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vancouver Retro Gaming Expo|url = http://www.vancouvergamingexpo.com/|website = www.vancouvergamingexpo.com|access-date = 2016-02-22|last = VGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retrogaming in museums ===
Retrogaming is recognized by [[museum]]s worldwide.  For example, the ''RetroGames'' arcade museum of [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]] was founded in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[https://retrogames.info/ RetroGames e.V.] (german)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/29231 |title=Erster eingetragener Verein für Computer- und Konsolenspiele-Oldies eröffnet |publisher=[[Heise.de]] |first=Peter |last=Schmitz |date=2002-07-19 |accessdate=2012-06-01 |language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Computerspielemuseum Berlin]] was founded in 1997.  Some classical art museums bear a video gaming retrospective, as with 2012's [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] exhibition titled ''[[The Art of Video Games]]''&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/story/2012-03-12/video-games-smithsonian/53502696/1? |title=Are video games art?

A MoMA/MoMA PS1 Blog |publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2015, The [[National Museum of Play]] adds games annually to the [[World Video Game Hall of Fame]].

== Legal issues surrounding retrogaming ==
Though many [[abandonware]] titles are available for free download on third-party websites, the duration of copyright on creative works in most countries is far longer than the era of home computing.

Emulators are typically created by third parties, and the software they run is often taken directly from the original games and put online for free download.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While it is completely legal for anyone to create an emulator for any hardware, unauthorized distribution of the code for a retro game is an infringement of the game's copyright.&lt;ref name=NGenEmu&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Emulations |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=28|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=42-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies have made public statements regarding the issues, such as Nintendo, stating that "the introduction of emulators created to play illegally copied Nintendo software represents the greatest threat to date in the intellectual property rights of video game developers”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = {{!}} Nintendo – Corporate Information {{!}} Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.)|url = https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#helping|website = www.nintendo.com|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, video game developers and publishers typically turn a blind eye to emulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One reason for this is that at any given time, most of the games illegally distributed for emulation are not presently being sold by the company which owns the game, and so the damages the company would collect in the event of a successful lawsuit would most likely be negligible.&lt;ref name=NGenEmu/&gt;

[[Image:Ripley410112.gif|right|thumb|370px|[[Robert Ripley]]'s ''Believe It or Not'' (January 12, 1941)]]
'''''Ripley's Believe It or Not!''''' is an American franchise, founded by [[Robert Ripley]], which deals in bizarre events and items so strange and unusual that readers might question the claims. Originally a newspaper [[Panel (comics)|panel]], the ''Believe It or Not'' feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including [[radio]], [[television]], [[comic book]]s, a chain of museums, and a book series.

The Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]-based [[Ripley Entertainment|Ripley Entertainment, Inc.]], a division of the [[Jim Pattison Group]], is a global company with an annual attendance of more than 12 million guests. Ripley Entertainment's publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters, and games.

Ripley first called his cartoon feature, originally involving sports feats, ''Champs and Chumps'', and it premiered on December 19, 1918, in the ''[[New York Globe]]''. Ripley began adding items unrelated to sports, and in October 1919, he changed the title to ''Believe It or Not''.  When the ''Globe'' folded in 1923, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York Evening Post]]''. In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by [[Associated Newspapers (U.S.)|Associated Newspapers]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Neal. ''A Curious Man: The Strange &amp; Brilliant Life of Robert "Believe It Or Not!" Ripley'' (Crown/Archetype, 2014), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the ''Globe''). That same year, Ripley hired [[Norbert Pearlroth]] as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Norbert Pearlroth, 89, Researcher For 52 Years For 'Believe It Or Not' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/15/obituaries/norbert-pearlroth-89-researcher-for-52-years-for-believe-it-or-not.html |quote=Norbert Pearlroth, who combed hundreds of thousands of books in the New York Public Library over 52 years as sole researcher for ''Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' died of heart and kidney diseases Thursday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 89 years old and lived in Brooklyn. ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 15, 1983 |accessdate=2015-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the ''[[New York American]]'' and was picked up by the [[King Features Syndicate]], being quickly syndicated on an international basis.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, ''A Curious Man'', pp. 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included [[Paul Frehm]] (1938–1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941–1949), [[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|Bob Clarke]] (1943–1944), Joe Campbell (1946–1956), Art Sloggatt (1971–1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of ''Believe It or Not!'' for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', as did [[Wally Wood]] and [[Ernie Kovacs]], who also did a recurring satire called "Strangely Believe It!" on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'', John Hix's ''[[Strange as it Seems]]'', and Gordon Johnston's ''[[It Happened in Canada]]''. The current artist is John Graziano and current researcher is Sabrina Sieck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/ripleysbelieveitornot |title=Ripley's Believe It or Not Comic Strip on |website=Gocomics.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers, and during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs.

''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog was "a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mendelson, Lee |title=Charlie Brown &amp; Charlie Schulz |year=1970 |publisher=The World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schulz's dog Spike later became the model for ''Peanuts''' [[Snoopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles M.|last=Schulz|title=Around the world in 50 years: Charlie Brown's anniversary celebration|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|year=1994|page=11|isbn=978-0-8362-1766-7|authorlink=Charles M.

The people whose items are featured in such books as [[Ripley's Believe It or Not Annual|''Strikingly True'']], have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc. describes as an obsession. "Whatever it is they're after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me."&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maynard's Spooky Action...An Interview with Edward Meyer from Ripley's Believe It or Not|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-161-19-nov-2011|website=[[The Skeptic Zone]]|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the Ripley's collection, rarely considered are alien or witchcraft-type stories, which are, according to Meyers, difficult to prove. To be included in Ripley's Believe It or Not books, museums, or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from Ripley's staff and be 100% authenticated.&lt;ref name="Maynard Interview"/&gt;

==Radio==
On April 14, 1930, Ripley brought "Believe It or Not" to [[radio]], the first of several series heard on [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}. Pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted by [http://www.otr.com/ripley_on_radio.html Ripley On Radio], Ripley's broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley's 1930 debut on ''[[The Collier Hour]]'' brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931–32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC's ''Saturday Party'', Ripley was the host of ''[[The Baker's Broadcast]]'' from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937–38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. ''See America First with Bob Ripley'' (1938–40) on CBS expanded geographically into ''See All the Americas'', a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on [[World War II]]. ''Romance, Rhythm and Ripley'' aired on CBS in 1945, followed by ''Pages from Robert L. Ripley's Radio Scrapbook'' (1947–48).

Robert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean, and he also participated in the first broadcast from [[Buenos Aires]] to [[New York City|New York]]. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matineeclassics.com/radio/1930/ripleys_believe_it_or_not/details/ |title=Old Time Radio Shows - Ripley's Believe It or Not!

As the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall cigarettes]] and [[General Foods]]. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to [[television]].

==Films, television, Internet, and computer game==
The newspaper feature has been adapted into more than a few films and TV shows.

===Film===
* Ripley hosted a series of two dozen ''Believe It or Not!'' theatrical short films between 1930 and 1932 for [[Warner Bros.]] [[Vitaphone]].

*He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, ''Seasons Greetings'' (1931), with [[Ruth Etting]], [[Joe Penner]], [[Ted Husing]], [[Thelma White]], [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], and others.
* Ripley's short films were parodied in a 1939 [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]] titled ''Believe It or Else''. Released on June 25, 1939, directed by [[Tex Avery]] and written by [[Dave Monahan]], it featured a running gag in which [[Egghead (Looney Tunes)#Egghead|Egghead]] (a prototype [[Elmer Fudd]]) appeared to declare, "I don't believe it!"  On 5 November of the same year, another Avery documentary parody, ''Fresh Fish'', was released. Written by [[Jack Miller (writer)|Jack Miller]], this cartoon's running gag was a two-headed fish that kept swimming onto the screen to ask, "Pardon me, but can you tell me where I can find Mister Ripley?"
*[[20th Century Fox]] produced another [[film short]] titled '''Acquitted By The Sea''', released September 27, 1940, produced by [[Truman Talley]] and directed by [[Earl Allvine]]. This told an unusual story involving the ''[[Titanic]]''.

====Planned film====
On October 4, 2004, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film would be produced by [[James Jacks]] and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] were hired to write the script. Jacks explained, "It's about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the '30s and '40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened." Jacks also said, "We want to turn it into an ''[[Indiana Jones]]'', a goofy version, as played by [[Johnny Depp]]. When they saw we had the writers from ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt|Larry Flynt]]'', they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]-type movie with one of their characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Brian|title=Paramount Telling Ripley Tale: Believe It or Not|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/04/paramount-telling-ripley-tale|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=IGN|date=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2005, it was announced that [[Tim Burton]] would direct the film, with [[Jim Carrey]] starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey May Believe|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/29/burton-carrey-may-believe|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=[[IGN]]|date=2005-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jacks, [[Sean Daniel]] and [[Richard D. Zanuck]] were also to serve as producers for the film.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011/&gt; Zanuck spent six weeks in China to [[Location scouting|scout filming locations]] for the project.&lt;ref name=Borat/&gt;

On June 12, 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film's script to focus more on Ripley's ''Believe It or Not'' column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project, ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Gardner|first2=Chris|title=Burton takes rain check on Par pic|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/burton-takes-rain-check-on-par-pic-1200337853/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton, Carrey put 'Believe' on hold|url=https://variety.com/2006/more/news/burton-carrey-put-believe-on-hold-1200337840/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer [[Steve Oedekerk]] to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Oedekerk brings 'Ripley' back to life|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/features/oedekerk-brings-ripley-back-to-life-1117955948/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2006-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding.&lt;ref name=Borat&gt;{{cite news|title=Borat's New-er Look|url=https://variety.com/2007/voices/columns/borats_newer_lo-1200571196/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oedekerk's draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Carrey lights up 'Phillip Morris'|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/carrey-lights-up-phillip-morris-1117966194/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, it was reported that Paramount may be searching for a new director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burton Off Believe It or Not?

In October 2008, [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus' idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a ''Ripley's'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|last2=Siegel|first2=Tatiana|title=Chris Columbus in talks for 'Ripley's': Paramount wants director for long-delayed film|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/chris-columbus-in-talks-for-ripley-s-1117994548/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Eric Roth]] was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel.&lt;ref name=Jan-2011&gt;{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Eric Roth takes on Ripley project: Jim Carrey remains attached to topline|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/eric-roth-takes-on-ripley-project-1118030181/|accessdate=2017-05-23|work=Variety|date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum in Bangalore - Jim Ankan Deka photo.jpg|thumb|Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum at Innovative Film City in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].]]
When Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933, it was labeled Ripley’s Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair. (In an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who "fainted" daily.) That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s, and Ripley's collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Dallas]], and [[Cleveland]]. In [[New York City|New York]], the famed [[Times Square]] exhibit opened in 1939 on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. In 1950, a year after Ripley's death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in [[St. Augustine, Florida]].

{{as of|2010|12}}, there are 32 Ripley's ''Believe It or Not!'' Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums, in the spirit of ''Believe It or Not!'', are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee]] and [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]]. Others are constructed oddly, such as the [[Orlando, Florida]] Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking.
Expected to open summer 2016 is the first Odditorium in the [[Netherlands]], at Dam square in [[Amsterdam]].

*'''St. Augustine''' – It is the oldest Ripley's Believe It or Not! and is located in the ''Castle Warden'', was purchased shortly after his death in 1949 and opened in 1950. Prior to becoming home to his vast collections from his many travels, "The Castle", as it is known, was once a hotel which played host to many famous guests, including Ripley himself and author/owner [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]]. It was originally a [[Moorish Revival style]] mansion, built in 1887 by millionaire William Warden as a winter home. Its popularity and success led Ripley's associates to open new establishments throughout the United States and the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is also rumored to be haunted. Segments of the most recent Ripley's TV series were filmed here, including the opening credits. Among the attractions here are a mummified cat, a 1/12 scale model of the original [[Ferris wheel]] made out of Erector sets, life and death masks of famous celebrities (including Abraham Lincoln), and shamanistic apparati from cultures around the world.

==Inaccuracies==
Authorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on their [[television]] show, where they often say "If you see it on Ripley's, you can bet that it's real". However, two claims{{specify|date=December 2010}} appearing in their books have been dubbed "myths" by  [[MythBusters]].[Which ones?] One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners ordered under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], has had its accuracy called into question by [[Snopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/misxlate/toux.asp |title=Ma Sacrée Toux! |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ripley's'' has reported the urban legend of [[Frank Tower]] - an individual who was supposed to have survived the sinkings of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], [[RMS Empress of Ireland|RMS ''Empress of Ireland'']], and [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] - as being factual.

'''''Robotica''''' is a [[robot combat]] show (similar to the early seasons of [[Robot Wars (TV series)|''Robot Wars'']]) produced for the American television cable channel [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]], a subsidiary of the [[Discovery Channel]] from April 4, 2001 to November 16, 2002. [[Ahmet Zappa]] and [[Tanya Memme]] hosted all three seasons while [[Tanika Ray]] only hosted the first season with [[Dan Danknick]] replacing her for the second and third seasons.

==Season 1==
Each preliminary show in the first season of ''Robotica'' featured four robots weighing as much as 210 pounds paired off in a series of three challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Robotica Season 1 rules [http://runamok.tech/rules/Robotica1_rules.html runamok.tech]&lt;/ref&gt; The winners of each pairing faced each other in a [[Robot-sumo]] style "Fight to the Finish" to determine the winner of the show.

*The first challenge was The Speedway. Robots raced in opposite directions around a figure-8 track. Robots were awarded 10 points for each lap completed (up to 8), with an additional 20 points awarded to the winner. This challenge had a two-minute time limit.
*The second challenge was The Maze. Robots negotiated obstacles in two identical, twisting courses that met in the middle. Five obstacles (teeter ramp, push box, rotating paddles, [[guillotine]], and waterfall) worth 15 points each, plus 25 points for the first robot to the center platform. This challenge had a three-minute time limit.
*The third challenge was The [[Running the Gauntlet|Gauntlet]]. Robots crashed through barrier walls of increasing difficulty. Five barriers (glass pane, paint cans filled with sand, bricks, [[concrete]] paving stones, and a heavy [[safe]]) worth 15 points each, plus 25 points to the first robot to complete the course. This challenge had a three-minute time limit.

Total points were added for the three events to determine a winner. In the event of a tie, the robot who won the greater number of events advanced.

The Fight to The Finish took place on a 16' by 16' platform elevated high above the floor. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute and then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals.

The finals worked the same way as the preliminary shows, except there were six robots, competing in three pairs. Three robots met in the Fight to the Finish.  The winner of the show was awarded the largest cash prize in robot combat to that date: $12,000.

==Seasons 2 and 3==
''Robotica'' seasons 2 and 3 featured redesigned challenges. The Speedway was eliminated, The Gauntlet was redesigned, and The Maze had been completely re-done and renamed The Labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;Robotica Season 2/3 rules [http://runamok.tech/rules/Robotica2+3_rules.html runamok.tech]&lt;/ref&gt;

The former side-by-side Gauntlet course was now arranged in a diamond-shape. The first barrier wall was now a wooden plank, the walls of metal cans, bricks, and concrete paving stones remained, and the safe was gone. Each robot had to complete their own two legs of the diamond and then return through the opponent's rubble field before climbing a ramp up to the Forest of Glass in the center of the diamond. When all the glass strips were broken, a final glass sheet lowered as the final challenge. Scoring was 10 points for each barrier, 5 points for each rubble wall, 10 points for first up the ramp, 5 points for second up the ramp, 15 points for the final glass pane. This challenge had 150 total points available and a three-minute time limit.

[[Image:Robotica rollers obstacle.jpg|right|thumb|Jawbreaker's Revenge battles Buzzbomb at the 'Rollers' obstacle: ''Robotica'' season 3]]
The former two-path Maze was now a single Labyrinth wherein both robots could roam to choose from six scoring obstacles. Also roaming the Labyrinth were two rat-shaped robots named the "Robotica Rats" that could interfere with (or sometimes help) the competitors. Breaking the glass strip beyond each obstacle claimed the points. Obstacles were:
#Push Box - 15 points
#Lifting Spikes - 15 points
#Suspension Bridge - 20 points
#Flipper - 20 points
#Rollers - 25 points
#Sand Box - 25 points
Robots started together in a motorized rotating [[revolving stage|turntable]], where combat was encouraged. A robot could be penalized the entire point total for an obstacle if they broke down or got stuck in a position that blocked access to the obstacle.

At the end of three minutes, or when all the obstacles were cleared, the exit opened. The final glass strip on the far side of the exit was worth 30 points. This challenge had 150 total points available and a four-minute time limit.

The winning pair of robots faced each other in The Fight to The Finish. The platform was enlarged from season 1; it was now a 25' by 25' elevated platform. A new rule called for robots to hold the other robot 'pinned' for no more than 15 seconds before release. A low guard rail surrounded the platform for the first minute, then fell away. The last robot on the platform moved on to the finals.

For the finals, three pairs of robots competed in The Gauntlet. The two robots with the lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining four robots paired off for The Labyrinth. The two winning robots met in The Fight to The Finish to determine the champion.

[[Image:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|[[Double Herm of Socrates and Seneca]] ([[Antikensammlung Berlin]])]]

'''Senecan tragedy''' refers to a set of [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[tragedies]]. Ten of these [[Play (theatre)|plays]] exist, of which most likely eight were written by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher and politician [[Lucius Annaeus Seneca]]. The group includes ''Hercules Furens'', ''Medea'', ''Troades'', ''Phaedra'', ''Agamemnon'', ''Oedipus'', ''Phoenissae'', ''Thyestes'', ''Hercules Oetaeus'', and ''Octavia''. ''Hercules Oetaeus'' is generally considered not to have been written by Seneca, and ''Octavia'' is certainly not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century, [[Italian humanists]] rediscovered these works, making them models for the revival of tragedy on the [[Renaissance]] stage. The two great, but very different, dramatic traditions of the age — French neoclassical tragedy and [[Revenge play|Elizabethan tragedy]] — both drew inspiration from Seneca. Usually, the Senecan tragedy focuses heavily on supernatural elements.

Although many of the Senecan tragedies adapt the same Greek myths as tragedies by [[Sophocles]], [[Aeschylus]], and [[Euripides]], scholars tend not to view Seneca's works as direct adaptations of the Attic works, as Seneca's approach to the myths differs significantly from the Greek poets and often contains themes familiar from his philosophical writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Buckley|editor1-first=Emma|editor2-last=Dinter|editor2-first=Martin|title=A Companion to the Neronian Age|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Seneca's tragic style was more directly influenced by [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarrant|first1=R. J.|title=Senecan Drama and Its Antecedents|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|date=1978|volume=82|pages=213–263|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French neoclassical dramatic tradition, which reached its highest expression in the 17th-century tragedies of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]], drew on Seneca for form and grandeur of style. These neoclassicists adopted Seneca's innovation of the confidant (usually a servant), his substitution of speech for action, and his moral hairsplitting.

The Elizabethan dramatists found Seneca's themes of bloodthirsty revenge more congenial to English taste than they did his form. The first English tragedy, ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' (1561), by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]] and [[Thomas Norton]], is a chain of slaughter and revenge written in direct imitation of Seneca. (As it happens, ''Gorboduc'' does follow the form as well as the subject matter of Senecan tragedy: but only a very few other English plays—e.g. ''[[The Misfortunes of Arthur]]''—followed its lead in this.) Senecan influence is also evident in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', and in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. All three share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and The Spanish Tragedy and Hamlet also have ghosts among the cast; all of these elements can be traced back to the Senecan model.

In [[fiction]], a '''subplot''' is a secondary strand of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]  that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]]. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the "world" of the work, and occurring to less important characters.  

In [[screenwriting]], a subplot is referred to as a "B story" or a "C story," etc.

A '''summer park''' is a form of [[amusement park|theme park]] with a [[summer]]time theme, open only during the summertime season. Instead of electricity-generated [[carousel]]s, [[playground]]s and [[swimming pool]] make up most attractions.

In [[Denmark]], several summer parks have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderful-denmark.com/Jutland-entertainment.html|title=Entertainment in Jutland|publisher=Wonderful Denmark|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]], the phenomenon was booming by the mid and late 1980s. After expanding during the [[Roaring 1980s|economic boom]], a decrease began in the early 1990s during the [[Swedish banking rescue|economc recession]], but also because of the introduction of a wider entertainment market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornmark.se/places_intro.aspx?placeid=98&amp;lang= Övergivna platser - ''Svenska Sommarland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''suspension of disbelief''' or '''willing suspension of disbelief''' has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary|author=&lt;!--None listed.--&gt;|date=2018|dictionary=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|title=suspend disbelief (phrase)|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|access-date=29 July 2018|edition=Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=|oclc=656668849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729045913/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|archive-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. '''Cognitive estrangement''' in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199532919|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= From 'King Kong' to 'Indecent Proposal,' audiences have been asked to buy a premise that can make – or break – a film|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-15/entertainment/ca-23034_1_indecent-proposal|accessdate=2010-10-24|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]] or transforms into a gorilla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Botos|first=Tim|title=‘Gorilla Girl' sideshow act hangs on despite changing times|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x144223716/-Gorilla-Girl-sideshow-act-hangs-on-despite-changing-times|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=GateHouse News Service; Patriot Ledger|date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enjoy the performance.

According to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. [[Black-and-white]] films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people ([[Achromatopsia|achromats]]), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.

== Coleridge's original formulation ==
Coleridge coined the phrase in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'', published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William.  ''On Language; Suspension of Disbelief''. New York Times. 7 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XIV describes the preparations with [[Wordsworth]] for their revolutionary collaboration ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. [[Alexander Pope]], notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.

Coleridge recalled:

{{quote|... It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object, to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us ...&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 1817, Chapter XIV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (with the quotation ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]'').

== Examples in literature ==
{{See also|Dramatic convention}}
Suspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who refers to it in the Prologue to ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'':

{{quote|[…] make imaginary puissance […] 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings […] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.}}

== Psychology ==
Psychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation.  When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, "poetic faith". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.

Only when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really "into" the fiction – "transported", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose.  We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Spiderman? Sure! The Neuroscience of Disbelief|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=312–320|url=https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/2003369909_Norman_Holland|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Literature and the Brain|url=http://www.literatureandthebrain.com|website=Literatureandthebrain.com|publisher=PsyArt|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book ''Flux''. It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.

== Criticisms ==

[[Aesthetics|Aesthetic philosophers]] generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and "fictions." [[Kendall Walton]] notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, "Look behind you!" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2025831 Fearing Fictions]", Kendall L. Walton, [[JSTOR]] (''[[Journal of Philosophy|The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 75, No. 1 (01-1978), pp. 5–27). Retrieved 3 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation "...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith," of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.{{or|date=August 2018}}

Not all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] challenges this concept in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner [[consistency]] of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an [[Fictional universe#Definition|internally consistent fictional world]], the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. “On Fairy-Stories.” The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983, pp. 109–61.

A '''swimsuit competition''', more commonly now called a '''bikini contest''', is a [[beauty pageant|beauty contest]] in which one of the judging criteria is the [[physical attractiveness|physical attributes]] of contestants, which is judged and ranked while contestants wear a [[swimsuit]], typically a [[bikini]].

Bikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products,&lt;ref name=adage&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article/sound-vision-music/inside-line-homemade-bikini-contest-marks-12th-year/58172/ |title = Inside Line: Homemade bikini contest marks 12th year |work=Advertising Age |publisher = Crain Communications Inc. |date = May 29, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; masquerading as mild [[adult entertainment]] in the forms of a beauty contest. Swimwear competitions have been a part of [[beauty pageant]]s, such as the [[Miss America]] and [[Miss World]] pageants and by organizations such as [[Hawaiian Tropic]], and may also be held in a bar or nightclub, during intermissions of boxing or wrestling matches or at a car show. Bodybuilding and fitness competitions have evolved to include a bikini division. Participants in such contests may be competing for prizes including trophies, money, and modeling contracts.

== History ==
In the United States, beauty pageants of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as  respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern "[[Miss America]]" contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held.

== Contest organization ==

{{multiple image |

|footer = Bikini contest in Florida, 2006}}

Public swimsuit competitions are subject to local [[Morality|decency]] laws, which generally require [[nipple]]s and [[labia]] to be covered. More specific standards of dress or [[nudity]] may be determined by the contest organisers. Contestants may be permitted or required to wear certain types of [[bikini]], such as the [[microkini]] (a bikini consisting of a minimal top and [[thong (clothing)|thong]]). Contest organisers may also specify the contestants' age range. In many contests the winners are determined by a panel of judges, but in some cases formal judging is absent and the winner is decided by popular vote. Announcers often present the competition, and they may also help the contestants to connect with the crowd. Winning over the crowd is of principal importance for many competitions, as results can be heavily influenced by audience input.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Bikini contests may be organised or sponsored by related companies for marketing purposes or to try to find and attract new talent to promote their products.&lt;ref name=adage /&gt; [[Miss Hawaiian Tropic]] is organized by [[Playtex]] to promote "[[Hawaiian Tropic]]", its suntan lotion. NOPI runs the annual [[Hot Import Nights]] bikini contest, which is held in conjunction with the import car-show in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and the annual [[Hooter's]] bikini competition.

There are some swimsuit competitions which aim to judge the beauty of a single part of body, such as female [[buttocks]] (for example, the [[Miss Bum Bum]] contest held in Brazil, and the [[Miss Reef]] contest held in several South American countries).&lt;ref name="FTDaily_Mail_October_26_2014c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2718984/Brazils-finest-assets-Country-unveils-27-women-set-compete-annual-Miss-Bum-Bum-contest.html |title=Brazil's finest assets on show: Country unveils the 27 women set to compete in its annual Miss Bum Bum contest |newspaper=Daily Mail |date= August 7, 2014 |author=Sophie Jane Evans |accessdate=October 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Despite their popularity and women's voluntary participation, swimsuit competitions, especially bikini contests, may be controversial. Critics argue that beauty contests reinforce the idea that girls and women are primarily valued for their physical appearance, and that this puts pressure on women to conform to conventional beauty standards by spending time and money on [[fashion]], [[cosmetics]], [[hair styling]] and even [[cosmetic surgery]]. It depletes their bodies of nutrients, energy and even water at the end and expresses a totally unrealistic and unsustainable lifestyle, centered purely around how little fat and how much spray tan they have on. This pursuit of physical beauty even encourages some women to diet to the point of harming themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty and body image in the media|publisher=Media Awareness Network|accessdate=2009-01-17|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094138/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/issues/stereotyping/women_and_girls/women_beauty.cfm|archivedate=18 January 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reigning Miss Universe Suspected of Having Cosmetic Surgery|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://cosmeticsurgerytoday.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/reigning-miss-universe-suspected-of-having-cosmetic-surgery/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826000856/http://cosmeticsurgerytoday.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/reigning-miss-universe-suspected-of-having-cosmetic-surgery/| archivedate= 26 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plastic Surgery: Bollywood, Miss Universe, and the Indian Girl Next Door|publisher=Gujarati Magazine (Sandesh)|accessdate=2010-08-23|url=http://www.shahfacialplastics.com/media/plastic_surgery_bollywood.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bikinis reappeared in later contests amid additional controversy. In the 1970s and 1980s the contest was regularly picketed by feminist protesters.&lt;ref name=magnanti /&gt; The pageant disappeared for a while and in 1996, when the Miss World contest was held in [[Bangalore]], India, dozens of Indian groups opposed to the event claimed that the contest degraded women by featuring them in bikinis. Social activist Subhashini Ali commented, "It's not an IQ test. Neither is it a charity show. It's a beauty contest in which these things have been added on as sops." The protests were so intense that the organizers were finally compelled to shift the venue of the "Swimsuit Round" to [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031217161734/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html |title=Miss Greece now Miss World, despite pageant protests |publisher=CNN |date=23 November 1996 |archivedate= 17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anita |last=Pratap |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030404132350/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html |title=Indian police prepare for worst in beauty pageant clash  |publisher=CNN|date=22 November 1996 | archivedate= 4 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/17/miss.world/index.html|title= Beauty pageant in India becomes a contest of wills  |first=Anita |last=Pratap |publisher=CNN |date= 17 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countering these claims, the contest organizer says that the organization has raised ₤300 million for charity in many of the countries where it operates since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/10067778/Miss-World-owner-Julia-Morley-How-a-mother-and-housewife-gave-the-beauty-pageant-a-positive-legacy.html  |title=Miss World owner: How a mother and housewife gave the beauty pageant a positive legacy |accessdate=21 August 2013 |date=20 May 2013 |first=Emma |last=Sinclair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Miss World event was hosted by Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. The country's top Muslim clerical body, the Indonesian Ulema Council, suggested that the event should be cancelled because it promotes "hedonism, materialism, and consumerism," and is nothing but "an excuse to show women's body parts that should remain covered." The organizers later announced that the bikini would be replaced by [[one-piece swimsuit]]s and [[sarong]]s, traditional beachwear on the resort island of [[Bali]]. Pageant Chairwoman Julia Morley explained, "I do not want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss World Beauty Pageant Bans Bikinis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/06/10/miss-world-beauty-pageant_n_3415087.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 10, 2013|quote=The bikini segment is one of the cornerstones of the Miss World Beauty Pageant but the 2013 event will not be featuring them.

Critics accuse the Miss World organizers of caving to extremist pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Leo|title=Miss World contest cuts bikini round to appease Muslim world|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article3784468.ece|publisher=Times Newspapers Limited|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that Bali is a destination for tourists from across the world who often wear minimal swimwear.&lt;ref name=theweek&gt;{{cite web|title=The controversial bikini ban at the Miss World beauty pageant|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/245346/the-controversial-bikini-ban-at-the-miss-world-beauty-pageant|accessdate=22 August 2013 |first=Harold |last=Maass |date= 7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke Magnanti argued that the decision to yield to religious fundamentalists was not a victory for [[feminism]]:

{{quote|While no great fan of pageants there's something about this that rubs the wrong way. For some time it's been clear that the interests and tactics of certain types of feminism and certain types of religious fundamentalism not only converge, but seem to complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnanti|first=Brooke|title=Miss World bikini ban: why it's no victory for feminists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10105935/Miss-World-2013-bikini-ban-why-its-no-victory-for-feminists.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Donald Trump]], who owned the [[Miss Universe]] beauty pageant until it was acquired by [[William Morris Endeavor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenkilloran/2015/09/14/donald-trump-owned-miss-universe-miss-usa-pageants-need-a-network-who-will-bite/|title=Donald Trump Sells Miss Universe, Miss USA Pageants To WME/IMG -- But They Still Need A Network|first=Ellen|last=Killoran|date=14 September 2015|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a competitor to the Miss World contest, was delighted to learn of the rival organization's decision. He told [[Fox TV]], "Well, I own Miss Universe, so I'm actually very happy about it—because if [[Miss World]] doesn't have bikinis their ratings go right down the tubes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Lily|title=Donald Trump Defends Bikini Contests on Miss World Competition|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/428239/donald-trump-defends-bikini-contests-on-miss-world-competition|publisher=E!Online|accessdate=June 14, 2013|date=June 10, 2013|quote=Bikini contests aren't going anywhere if Donald Trump has his way.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally, [[Miss Teen USA]], a Miss Universe pageant, abolished swimsuit competitions in favour of a sportswear competition in 2016.

=== Miss Earth contest ===

[[Vida Samadzai]] was the 2003 Afghani contestant for the [[Miss Earth]] title. She was severely condemned by the both Afghan authorities and community for seeking the title.&lt;ref name=Gersh&gt;Gersh Kuntzman, "[http://gershkuntzman.homestead.com/files/Beauty_is_a_Beast.htm Beauty is a Beast]", ''Newsweek'', 2003-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Samadzai was born in Afghanistan but raised in the United States. She was living in India at the time of the contest.&lt;ref name=Fida&gt;Ayesha Matthan, "[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/12/18/stories/2007121850150600.htm Fida over Vida]", ''The Hindu'', 2007-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Afghan Supreme Court]] banned swimsuit contests and said that appearing naked in beauty contests is completely un-Islamic, and is against Afghan tradition, human honour and dignity. [[Habiba Sarabi]], the Afghan women affairs minister, said Samadzai's  semi-naked appearance "is not women's freedom but in my opinion is to entertain men". Afghanistan's embassy in Washington DC declared that claims by [[Afghan American]] Samadzai to represent Afghanistan is baseless.&lt;ref&gt;News desk, "[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=126&amp;art_id=qw1067503501825B212&amp;set_id=1 Afghan Supreme Court bans beauty pageants]", ''Independent Online'', 2003-09-30&lt;/ref&gt; Samadzai, the second woman to be crowned Miss Afghanistan after [[Zohra Daoud]]'s crowning in 1972, received a number of death threats and had to be under the protection of [[FBI]] for three months.&lt;ref name=Gersh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farhad J. Dadyburjor, "[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1049966 I was under FBI's watch for 3 months: Miss Afghanistan]", ''Daily News and Analysis'', 2006-06-29&lt;/ref&gt; She said she was a bit uncomfortable wearing the "70s style red bikini" and was aware of the risks involved.&lt;ref name=Fida /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News Desk, "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19308457_ITM Miss Afghanistan says she was uncomfortable wearing bikini, goal is to help women and children back home]", ''Financial Times'', 2003-11-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimi Yoshino, "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-87832327.html Causing a stir, all because of a bikini]", ''Times New Service '', 2003-11-28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children's bikini contest ===
''Miss Tanguita'', which translates as "Miss Child Bikini", is held in Barbosa, Santader, [[Colombia]] as annual part of the "del Rio Suarez" Festival. The organisers deny the allegations that the competition is a camouflage for sexual exploitation, and instead describe it as an awareness event about the importance of children's fitness. Activists say that the competition, though legal, abuses the human rights of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pekanbaru.tribunnews.com/2015/01/14/wah-kontes-ratu-bikini-anak-anak-digelar-di-negara-ini |title=Wah, Kontes Ratu Bikini Anak-anak Digelar di Negara Ini |author=Raya Desmawanto Nainggolan |date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miss Teen USA ===
Beginning in 2016, the Miss Teen USA pageant removed the swimsuit competition and replaced it with an athleticwear round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/shows/total_divas/news/781840/first-look-see-what-miss-teen-usa-contestants-will-wear-instead-of-bikinis|title=First Look!

A '''talent show''' is an event in which participants [[performing arts|perform the arts]] of [[singing]], [[dancing]], [[lip sync|lip-syncing]], [[acting]], [[martial arts]], playing an [[musical instrument|instrument]], or other activities to showcase [[skill]]s. Many talent shows are performances rather than contests, but some are actual contests. In the instance of a contest, participants may be motivated to perform for a reward, trophy, or prize of some kind. For example, a [[high school]] might not have many students with any interest in performing in front of the student body for the sole purpose of performing alone and may offer different prizes as an incentive for these students to participate in the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parke |first=Beverly N. |title=Discovering Programs for Talent Development |year=2003 |publisher=Corwin Press |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |isbn=978-0-7619-4613-7|pages=131–32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71ysy1gOEcMC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22talent%20shows%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

Since the late 1980s, talent shows have become a notable genre of [[reality television]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Redden|first=Guy|title=Exposing Lifestyle Television: The Big Reveal|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-9286-3|pages=129–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YNJN-tolIwEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22talent+show%22&amp;ots=I7uqlYNPUs&amp;sig=jQ6A2VBPiX_e2DB63bJI0mzSx4o#v=onepage&amp;q=%22talent%20show%22&amp;f=false|chapter=Making Over the Talent Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Notun Kuri]]'' (1976), ''[[Popstars]]'' (1999), ''[[Star Academy]]'' (2001), [[Idols (TV series)|''Idol'']] (2001), ''[[The X Factor]]'' (2004), ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]'' (2005), ''[[Got Talent]]'' (2006), ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'' (2010), ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' (2013), ''[[Tri Akkorda (Russian Talent Show)]] (2014)'' and ''[[The Four: Battle for Stardom]] (''2018'')'', which have been critical in catapulting some amateur artists to stardom and resulting in their commercially successful careers.

==Non-competitive talent shows for troubled youths==
Talent shows can be seen as a way to help boost the self-esteem, confidence, and assurance of youth. Some communities and companies see talent shows as a way to help prevent [[juvenile delinquency]] among children, teens, and young adults. As a result, these communities create programs such as ''Girls Only!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only! Toolkit|url=http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|website=San Diego District Attorney's Office|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528165206/http://www.sdcda.org/office/girlsonlytoolkit/toolkit/girls-only-toolkit.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Diego]] to promote the growth of these otherwise trouble youth to better the community. Such programs are created with the hope to prevent youth from the possibilities of entering delinquency or lives of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls Only!

A '''technical director''' ('''TD''') is usually a senior technical person within e.g. a [[software]] company, [[engineering]] firm, [[film]] studio, [[Theatre|theatrical]] company or [[television studio]].  This person usually possesses the highest level of [[skill]] within a specific technical field.

== Software ==
In [[software development]], a technical director is typically responsible for the successful creation and delivery of the company's product to the marketplace by managing technical risks and opportunities; making key [[software design]] and implementation decisions with the development teams, scheduling of tasks including tracking dependencies, managing [[change request]]s, and guaranteeing quality of deliveries and educating the team on technical [[best practice]]s.

Typical responsibilities:
* Defines the technological strategy in conjunction with the development team of each project: pipeline, tools, and key development procedures
* Assesses technical risk and mitigation plan
* Establishes standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression
* Evaluates development teams, identifying strengths, problem areas, and developing plans for improving performance
* Evaluates interview candidates for technical positions
* Scouts for and evaluates new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and development excellence
* Oversees technical design documentation process for correctness and timeliness
* Provides input to the other disciplines on the practicality of initial design goals and impact to the overall project timeline
* Evaluates software implementation on design and task thoroughness
* Helps to identify high risk areas for the project director
* Identifies weak software systems that need code improvement and schedules corrective action, when possible
* Creates automated test process for system features, where possible, and contributes to the build system
* Aids in all stages of post-production including during finalizing

== Film and games ==
In visual effects (VFX) ([[Industrial Light and Magic]], [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]), feature animation ([[Pixar]], [[Dreamworks Animation]]) and game development ([[Naughty Dog]]), a technical director's responsibilities vary from studio to studio and as such, the term is not very well defined.

Typically, a TD is a combination of an artist and a programmer, responsible for the more technical aspects of film production, such as programming [[shader]]s, developing [[Skeletal animation|character rigs]] and animation setups, performing complex simulation tasks and setting up the pipeline (how the data is passed from one stage in the film production to the next). In contrast to a programmer, a TD would normally not work on large programming projects, but rather make heavy use of [[scripting language]]s such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Maya Embedded Language|MEL]], [[MAXScript]], or [[shell script]]ing.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Another responsibility of a TD is to look after any technical problems the regular artists encounter and to develop custom tools to improve the artists' workflow.

In these industries, "technical artist", "technical animator" and "generalist TD" are sometimes used as synonyms.

===Categorization of technical directors in film and games===
Frequently, the role of a TD is more precisely defined. Various areas of computer graphics require a high degree of specialized technical/scientific knowledge and therefore merit more precise categorization. As an example, a skilled Character TD has a strong understanding of human/animal anatomy, movement, and mechanics, whereas a skilled Lighting TD might have a detailed understanding of the physical properties of light and surfaces.

Those categories include (but are not limited to) the following.
* Effects TD
* Lighting TD
* Modeling TD 
* Pipeline TD
* Layout TD
* [[Character TD|Creature TD or Character TD]]
* Hair TD 
* Cloth TD 
* Matchmove TD

=== Education ===
Technical directors usually have a background in computer science, though such education often lacks expertise in practical film and media production. [[Film Academy Baden-Württemberg|Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg]] offers a unique, 30-month postgraduate course for technical directing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://td.animationsinstitut.de Technical Directing]&lt;/ref&gt; The course is open to applicants worldwide (English language skills required). Aside from working on film, animation, vfx and game projects, the students also engage in research.

== Theatre ==
It is a technical director's job to make sure the technical equipment in the theater is functional, maintained and safe. The technical director, along with the production manager, is responsible for the overall organization of the technical production process. Duties included are generating necessary working drawings for construction (in conjunction with a draftsperson, if there is one); budget estimations and maintaining of accounts; materials research and purchasing; scheduling and supervising build crews; coordinating load-ins; handling conflicts that arise between different departments; and organizing the strike and clean-up for the production. Often times the Technical Director can serve as the head of the scenic department, supervising the master carpenter, carpenters, charge artists and leading them in the realiziation of the scenic designer's vision. 

"Technical director" can also refer to the in-house chief designer or master carpenter for a smaller theater company.

In venues that host touring productions, the TD may also be responsible for advancing the technical rider, hiring local crew, renting equipment and liaisoning between the tour manager and the local crew.

== Television ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cut (film)]] --&gt;
The technical director works in a [[production control room]] of a [[television studio]] and operates the [[Vision mixer|video switcher]] and associated devices as well as serving as the chief of the [[television crew]].  For a [[remote broadcast]] outside of the [[television studio|studio]], the TD will perform the same duties in a mobile [[production truck]]. It is the TD's job to ensure all positions are manned and all equipment and facilities are checked out and ready before the recording session or live broadcast begins. They typically will switch video sources, perform live digital effects and transitions, and insert pre-recorded material, graphics and titles as instructed by the [[Television director|director]]. In larger productions, the director does not actually operate the production equipment, allowing him/her to coordinate the production and make rapid decisions without worrying about how to mechanically execute the effect or camera move being called for. The technical director may provide training to more inexperienced members of the technical crew when needed. In consultation with the director, the TD may have more or less input into the creative side of the production, depending on the situation.  He/she may provide the director with guidance on crew assignments, camera shots and the most efficient way to accomplish any given effect. The TD is usually responsible for the technical quality of the signal being recorded or broadcast and will use various measuring devices and displays to ensure quality control.

Technical directors commonly work on productions that are either broadcast live or recorded on [[video tape]] or [[video server]]s. Television productions shot on film generally do not use TDs, as the camera cuts and effects are realized in [[post production]] after the shooting is completed.

The terminology in the [[UK]] differs in some respects from the above description: The production control room is called a "gallery", a mobile production truck is called an "[[Outside broadcasting|OB van]]" or a "scanner" (a [[BBC]] term).  In UK television practice, the technical director is the senior technical person in the gallery and supervises the technical team, but does not operate the "[[vision mixer]]".  The TD is responsible for ensuring that the gallery is technically fit for purpose, the routing of internal and external sources, as well as liaison with other technical areas such as [[master control]] rooms and transmission suites. They may additionally perform vision control duties, matching the exposure and colour balance of the cameras ("racking").

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}
{{Use British English|date=November 2010}}{{italic title}}
'''''The Beatles Anthology''''' is a [[television documentary]], a three-volume set of double albums, and a book focusing on the history of [[the Beatles]]. [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] all participated in the making and approval of the works, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Anthology'' project, while [[John Lennon]] had archival interviews.

The documentary series was first broadcast in November 1995, with expanded versions released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] in 1996 and on [[DVD]] in 2003. The documentary used interviews with the Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances. The [[The Beatles Anthology (book)|''Anthology'' book]], released in 2000, paralleled the documentary in presenting the group's history through quotes from interviews.

The initial volume of the album set (''[[Anthology 1]]'') was released the same week of the documentary's airdate, with the subsequent two volumes (''[[Anthology 2]]'' and ''[[Anthology 3]]'') released in 1996. They included unreleased performances and outtakes presented in roughly chronological order, along with two new songs based on demo tapes recorded by Lennon after the group broke up: "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (Beatles song)|Real Love]]", both produced by [[Jeff Lynne]].

==Documentary series==
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology (TV series)}}
Approximately coinciding with the release of the "[[Free as a Bird]]" single and ''[[Anthology 1]]'' album (the first of three double-CD albums), ''The Beatles Anthology'' series of documentaries was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the United Kingdom and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in the United States in 1995. The ''Anthology'' series takes a form similar to that of the ''Anthology'' book, by being a series of first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external "objective" narration.  Footage in the ''Anthology'' series features [[voice-over]] recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others. As well as telling their story through archival footage, [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series; [[John Lennon]] appears only in historic archival footage.  The Beatles' wives, past and present, do not appear (excluding archival footage such as video from India and the music video for Harrison's song "Something").

The series, which was made over five thousand hours of planning and production, is composed of numerous film clips and interviews that present a complete history of the band from the Beatles' own personal perspectives. When it aired on ABC, the series comprised six hour-long programs, aired on three nights in November 1995. The series was later released, as eight expanded episodes, on VHS, laserdisc and as a boxed set of five DVDs (4 discs with 2 episodes apiece and a disc of extras).

Air dates on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:

* Sunday, 19 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.
* Wednesday, 22 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.
* Thursday, 23 November 1995: 9–11 p.m.

Part 1 of the series drew 17 million households,&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;Kaltenbach, Chris. "[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-12-03/news/1995337214_1_beatles-anthology-part-2 Beatles' appeal appears limited Ho-hum: Millions of people tuned in to the three-part 'Anthology' on ABC, but many more were watching other shows]." ''The Baltimore Sun''. 1995-12-03. Retrieved 2015-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning an average of 27.3 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-29/entertainment/ca-8209_1_beatles-anthology|title=TV Ratings :  'Beatles' Fades; 'Football,' With Elvis, Is No. 1|first=LEE|last=MARGULIES|date=29 November 1995|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was much better than usual for ABC at the time, but behind most broadcasts of ''[[Friends]]'' on [[NBC]],&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt; which in its second season was averaging 29.4 million viewers per episode.

In promoting the series during this time, ABC identified itself as "A-Beatles-C" – an homage to the mid-1960s [[Cousin Felica]]-era "77 W-A-Beatles-C" call sign of the network's flagship NYC AM radio station – and several of the network's prime-time sitcoms replaced their regular opening credit themes with Beatles tracks.

==Albums==
{{Main|Anthology 1|Anthology 2|Anthology 3}}
To accompany the ''Anthology'' series, three albums were issued, each containing two CDs or three vinyl LPs of mostly never-before-released Beatles material (the exceptions being the Tony Sheridan-era material), although many of the tracks had appeared on [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] for many years prior.

Two days after the first television special in the series had aired, ''[[Anthology 1]]'' was released to stores, and included music recorded by [[the Quarrymen]], the famous [[Decca Records]] [[The Decca audition|audition tapes]], and various out-takes and demos from the band's first four albums. It also included the song "Lend Me Your Comb", omitted from the collection ''[[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|Live at the BBC]]'', released the previous year (1994). The song "[[Free as a Bird]]" was included at the very start. 450,000 copies of ''Anthology 1'' were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever. The band's first drummer [[Pete Best]], replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962 before the Beatles recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.

''[[Anthology 2]]'' was released on 17 March 1996. The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for ''[[Help!]]'', ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", previously available only to bootleg collectors. The new song "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" – which, like "Free as a Bird", was based on an unfinished Lennon recording – was also included in the two-CD collection.

''[[Anthology 3]]'' was released on 28 October 1996. The third collection featured out-takes and demos from ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' ("White Album"), ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be]]'', as well as several songs from Harrison and McCartney which later became post-Beatle tracks.

===Collage===
[[File:Anthology cover collage.jpg|center|Collage of the three covers of ''The Beatles Anthology'', created by [[Klaus Voormann]].]]

The three album covers, when laid side-by-side, become one long painted collage of various peeling posters and album covers representing the different stages of the Beatles' career. This was the work of [[Klaus Voormann]], who also created the album cover for ''Revolver'' in 1966. The ''Anthology'' covers required Voormann to recreate elements of his cover for ''Revolver'' within the collage. During the music video for "[[Free as a Bird]]", the ''Anthology'' collage appears as posters on a shop window as the camera pans quickly across the street. The design also adorned the VHS, [[laserdisc]] and DVD releases, again to be properly encountered by laying the cases side-by-side.  Upon the release of ''Anthology 3'', [[HMV]] stores made available a limited edition cardboard sleeve designed to hold all three CD volumes of which each side of the sleeve make up half of the collage.

===Digital release and ''Anthology Highlights''===
All three albums were made digitally available on the [[iTunes]] Store on 14 June 2011, alongside a new ''Anthology Highlights'' album which featured a selection of tracks from all three albums and reached number 184 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s United States [[Billboard charts#Albums|Top Current Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2011-07-02/current-albums|title=Top Current Albums|date=2 July 2011|website=[[Billboard.biz]]|accessdate=12 October 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
{{Main|The Beatles Anthology (book)}}

[[File:erw.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of ''The Beatles Anthology'' paperback book]]

In October 2000, ''The Beatles Anthology'' book was released, which included interviews with all four band members and others involved, plus rare photos. Many of the interviews quoted are from those featured in the documentary films. The book is designed as a large-format hardback, with imaginative artwork throughout, and several visually impressive and colourful spreads featuring graphics relevant to the proceeding chronology, photographic arrays and a variety of text styles and layouts. The book went straight to the top of the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestsellers list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/2000/2000-10-22.pdf The ''New York Times'' Best Seller List - 22 October 2000]. From Hawes.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the book was released as a large-format paperback.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2002/12/08/the-beatles-anthology-publish/5881b4c7-2dd0-445b-8fbe-f4ce665d6c3c/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Carnival of Light|Now and Then (John Lennon song)}}

During early 1995 as work on ''The Beatles Anthology'' continued, [[Yoko Ono]] and McCartney recorded an [[avant-garde]] piece called "Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue". Ono provided vocals and McCartney played bass, while [[Sean Lennon]], [[Linda McCartney]], and McCartney's children played various instruments. The piece was broadcast on Japanese public television in memory of the 50th anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A new song for history |date=4 August 1995 |agency=AP |newspaper=Times Daily |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PV8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E8kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2618,562306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track "[[Carnival of Light]]" recorded during the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' sessions was intended to be released on the ''[[Anthology 2]]'' album, but was vetoed by George Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/carnival-of-light/2/ |title=Carnival of Light |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked on a new composition called "All for Love" in March 1995, intended as a track on ''Anthology 3'', but the effort was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/411allforlove.html |title=More on "All For Love" -- what Paul really said (with pictures) |publisher=Abbeyrd.best.vwh.net |date= |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128100439/http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/411allforlove.html |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; No version of the song has reached the public.

==Promotional items==
Each of the three ''Anthology'' albums was accompanied by a promotional CD sampler sent to radio stations shortly before the official release dates. These CDs have since become highly sought collector's items. Even rarer is a vinyl version of the sampler for ''Anthology 2'', which was only sent to college radio stations and featured a different cover (though the contents were the same).

In October 1996 there was a strictly limited release from [[EMI]], a slip case cover to house all three CD volumes, which have since become extremely rare, fetching high prices among collectors.

==Parodies==
The success of the ''Anthology'' albums was parodied by the release of the [[The Rutles|Rutles]]' ''[[The Rutles Archaeology|Archaeology]]'' some months later. Delays in the release of the third volume of the Beatles' series ultimately meant that the Rutles' parody arrived in shops on the same day as its inspiration.

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] parodied ''The Beatles Anthology'' in an ''[[Al TV]]'' special. He said he had a copy of a fictional ''Anthology 17'', which he claimed would not be available to the public for a while. He played for the audience a track of Paul McCartney brushing his teeth and Ringo Starr shaving before ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

''The Beatles Anthology'' was also parodied on the short-lived ''[[Dana Carvey Show]]'', which was being aired on [[ABC Television Network|ABC]] around the same time that ''Anthology'' was being televised on the network.

'''Theatre for Young Audiences''' (TYA) is a branch of [[theatre arts]] that encompasses all forms of theatre that are attended by or created for younger audiences. It blankets many different forms of theatre methods and expressions, including plays, dance, music, puppetry, circus, [[physical theatre]], and many others. It is globally practiced, takes many forms, both traditional and non-traditional, and explores a wide variety of themes ranging from fairy tales to parental abuse.  

Originating in the 20th century, TYA is a recent branch of Theatre Arts. It takes on many functions in different settings and places around the world. In the US, for instance, it is often entertainment-centered, although its roots lie in education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many writers and production companies have started catering specifically to TYA audiences, causing a continuous increase in theatrical material for children. In the present day, TYA production companies or groups can be found in most regions of the US and around the world. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

==History==

Theatre performed by or for children dates back hundreds of years. The first mention is seen in a 1784 entry in [[Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis|Madame de Genlis]]’s Memoirs, in which she describes a performance by her two daughters to the [[Duke of Chartres]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre for Children|last=Ward|first=Winifred|publisher=D. Appleton-Century Company Inc.|year=1939|isbn=|location=London|pages=2-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; TYA became its own branch of theatre in the 20th century, first appearing in Moscow, when Russian actress [[Natalya Sats|Natalia Satz]] founded the Moscow Theatre for Children in 1918. In its early stages, the Moscow Theatre for Children viewed its goal as representing childhood needs, separating the struggles of childhood from those of adult life. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similar TYA groups were established in England, the US, France, and Czechoslovakia between World War I and World War II &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/theatre-for-young-audiences/|title=Theatre for Young Audiences|last=James|first=Joanne|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==TYA in the United States==

Education was the main purpose of TYA when it first arrived to the US. In 1903, [[Alice Minnie Herts]] founded The Children’s Educational Theatre, which was the first US company to produce theatrical work both with and for children. Although it did not last long, The Children’s Educational Theatre inspired both the birth of other companies around the country, as well as continuous growth in the writing and production of plays for younger audiences &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The Drama League of America was another big influence in TYA within the US: children’s leagues were established in cities across the country, and material for younger audiences was both presented at these establishments and distributed to any interested groups. The Drama League was responsible for changing theatre for children from its originally purely educational intent into the broader Theatre for Young Audiences known today. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's Theatre|last=Goldberg|first=Moses|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1974|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|pages=3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the TYA movement started to gain traction, many different companies and playwrights chose to partake in this new branch of theatre. Some include early TYA playwright Constance Mackay, the Chicago company The Junior League, New York producer [[Clare Tree Major]], The Children’s Theatre of Evanston, and many others. Today, TYA continues to thrive, with an increasing number of playwrights, performers, producers, and companies taking part in it. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Types of Theatre for Young Audiences==

Most  TYA  productions in the US are plays, with a fast-growing number of musicals taking second place. However, most performing arts forms have been adapted and incorporated into Theatre for Young Audiences, including physical theatre, operas, puppetry, dance, street performance, and many others. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theatre for Young Audiences|last=McCaslin|first=Nellie|publisher=Longman Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0-582-28011-7|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies specifically cater to non-traditional theatre forms, such as the MainStreet Theatre Company and the Center for Pupetry Arts, Atlanta. Several major companies performing Theatre for Young Audiences exist across the US, including but not limited to Minneapolis [[Children's Theatre Company|Children’s Theatre Company]], [[Seattle Children's Theatre|Seattle Children’s Theatre]], Lexington Children’s Theatre, Adventure State Chicago, and Boston Children’s Theatre, all producing work specifically for younger audiences throughout the year, offering performances both of new work and TYA classics &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. 

==Techniques==

Most Theatre for Young Audiences plays are written by adult playwrights, although occasional projects are led and constructed by the younger audiences themselves. Different schools of thought within TYA  argue whether or not younger characters should be portrayed by children or by adult actors. At the present, most TYA productions in children’s companies around the country count on casts of professional adult actors to portray all roles. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, the [[Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities|Arvada Center]]’s 2016 production of an adaptation of the novel ''[[Junie B. Jones]]'' was produced with adult actors, including Melissa Morris, Katie Jackson, and Rachelle Wood, portraying characters who are around the age of 12. A number children’s companies in the US have designated programs, in which the children engage with workshops and experimental rehearsals in order to create a TYA production with child actors. Those are rarely, however, part of the companies’ main stage season. Many Theatre for Young Audiences productions still revolve around traditional child-friendly topics, such as fairy tales and magical quests. A number of theatre companies, such as [[Seattle Children's Theatre|Seattle Children’s Theatre]] and the Minneapolis [[Children's Theatre Company|Children’s Theatre Company]], have been working to create and produce  plays and musicals for young audiences that are more intelligent and diverse. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spotlight on the Child: Studies in the History of American Children's Theatre|last=Bedard|first=Roger L.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1989|isbn=0-313-25793-0|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent work has explored themes that include parental abuse (e.g. ''An Afternoon of the Elves'' by [[Janet Taylor Lisle]]), divorce (e.g. ''Doors'', by Suzan Zeder), death (e.g. ''Afflicted'', by Laurie Brooks), and social barriers such as racism, xenophobia, and homophobia (e.g. ''The Transition of Doodle Pequeño'', by Gabriel Jason Dean).

'''Theatrical constraints''' are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of [[Play (theatre)|stage play]]s in the [[theater]].   Whether imposed externally, by virtue of [[monopoly]] franchises or [[censorship]] laws, or whether imposed voluntarily by actors, [[theatre director|director]]s, or [[theatrical producer|producer]]s, these restraints have taxed the creative minds of the theatre to  tackle the challenges of working with and around them.

The [[Classical unities]], requiring "unity" of "time, place, and subject", is the most well-known of all theatrical constraints.  It was first employed by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and later became more fully embraced in France. Another example is the Japanese prohibition of female acting in 1625, then the prohibition of young male actors in 1657, that create "[[Kabuki|Onnagata]]" which is the ground of Japanese theatrical tradition.  In the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] theatre of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], a similar ban forbade all actresses from appearing on stage, at all; the parts of women were generally played by boys.  The plot of ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' turns on this fact.

In [[film|cinema]], the [[Dogme 95]] films form a body of work produced under voluntary constraints that severely limit both the choice of subjects and the choice of techniques used to bring them to the screen.

Another culturally significant constraint occurred in France.  In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact), Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors – strolling players going from fairground to fairground, market place to market place – took over the Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success.

But this aroused the jealousy of the [[Comédie-Française]] which decided to outlaw all spoken dialogue except in its own theatre. To overcome this, the travelling players divided their plays into soliloquies and performed nothing but monologues – which brought them even greater success than previously.   One actor would say his lines, run off into the wings, while another appeared in order to reply. He would then go off in his turn, allowing the first one to come back and reply, and so on and so forth.

After this, the Comédie-Française declared that they alone had the right to use speech on stage. Consequently, the public theatre found its way round this by using song instead of speech – and this is how French [[Operetta]] came into being. But then the Academy of Music proclaimed that they alone should be given the right to sing!

So in the markets and fairgrounds the itinerant actors created a new theatrical form by holding up cue-cards (like sub-titles or [[karaoke]]) containing the words of the plays or songs, which the audience then acted or sang for them. This became even more successful, with crowds coming from all around to see how the actors had overcome such rigid censorship.

Some of the restrictions, or traditions born of them, may have still been in place in the nineteenth century, at least if [[Marcel Carné]]'s ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' is a reliable guide.  This also explains why France has given the world so many [[mime artist|mime]]s.

In [[comedy]], a '''throwaway line''' (also: '''throwaway joke''' or '''throwaway gag''') is a [[joke]] delivered "in passing" without being the [[punch line]] to a [[comedy routine]], part of the [[wikt:buildup|build up]] to another joke, or (in the context of [[drama]]) there to advance a story or develop a character. Throwaway lines are often [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s, or [[in-joke]]s, and often delivered in a [[deadpan]] manner.

In [[comic strip]]s ([[Sunday comics]] in particular) throwaway gags are often placed in the throwaway panels of the comic, and are located there so that removing the throwaway panels for space reasons will not destroy the narrative of the central comic.

In [[episodic fiction]], a line intended originally as a throwaway line in one episode may later be [[retconned]] by being incorporated into the [[back-story]] of the main drama, and used to develop the longer-term plot.

The {{nihongo|'''''Ultra Series'''''|ウルトラシリーズ|Urutora Shirīzu}} is the collective name for all the shows produced by [[Tsuburaya Productions]] featuring [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]], his many brethren, and the myriad Ultra Monsters. The Ultra Series is one of the prominent [[tokusatsu]] superhero genre productions from Japan, along with [[Toei Company|Toei]] produced series ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and the ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Heroes]]''. The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the ''daikaiju'' (大怪獣, "giant monster") genre, along with [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' series, and [[Daiei Film]]'s ''[[Gamera]]'' series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the ''kyodai hīro'' (巨大ヒーロー, "giant hero") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.

==The Ultramen==
{{Multiple issues|

}}
As revealed in ''[[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]]'', the Ultramen are a technologically advanced civilization who were originally identical to humans. They were evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]] and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the {{nihongo|Space Garrison|宇宙警備隊|Uchū Keibitai}} to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.

The Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or "warning lights", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.

Ultra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. As when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire, an Ultraman can be revived with a massive energy infusion. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.

==The Ultraman phenomenon==
The show ''[[Ultraman]]'' was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' (1967, [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), ''[[The Return of Ultraman]]'' (1971, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Ace]]'' (1972, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'' (1973, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Leo]]'' (1974, TBS), ''[[Ultraman 80]]'' (1980, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'' (1996, [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]), ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'' (1997, MBS), ''[[Ultraman Gaia]]'' (1998, MBS), and ''[[Ultraman Cosmos]]'' (2001, MBS). Recently the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the "Ultra N Project", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the "mascot" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as the final episode of ''Ultraman Nexus'') in late 2003, ''[[Ultraman Nexus]]'' (2004, [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting|CBC]]), and ''[[Ultraman (2004 film)|ULTRAMAN]]'' (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to old-school style series in the form of ''[[Ultraman Max]]'' (2005, CBC). In the course of the ''Max'' series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, ''[[Ultraman Mebius]]'', which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: ''[[Ultraman Hikari]]'', formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.

The franchise has also been in the movie theaters, starting with ''[[Ultraman Zearth]]'' and ''Ultraman Zearth 2,'' ''[[Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey]],'' released in 2000, as well as ''ULTRAMAN,'' a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of ''[[Ultraman Neos]]'' in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The ''Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers'' movie opened in September 2006.

Foreign productions include the 1987 [[Hanna-Barbera]] co-production ''[[Ultraman: The Adventure Begins]]'' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Ultraman USA''), an animated movie; ''[[Ultraman: Towards the Future]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Great''), an Australian 1991 production and ''[[Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Powered''), produced in the [[United States]] in 1993. Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only ''Ultra Q'', the original ''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', ''Ultraman Great'' &amp; ''Ultraman Tiga'' were known to be translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Portuguese  (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' in [[Brazil]]), [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (''Ultraman Tiga'', ''Ultraman Dyna'', ''Ultraman Gaia'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraman Max'' and ''Ultraman Mebius''). Also of note is the [[American English]] dub of ''Ultraman Tiga'' by [[4Kids Entertainment]] that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.

In 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and [[Toei Company]] co-produced ''[[Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider]],'' a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's ''[[Kamen Rider]]''. This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.

At present, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen. (The figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities—it has been revealed in ''Nexus'' that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts.) In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/pressrelease/130912-guinness/ |title="最も派生テレビシリーズが作られたテレビ番組"として『ウルトラマン』が世界記録に認定 &amp;#124; 株式会社 円谷プロダクション |publisher=Tsuburaya-prod.co.jp |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|title=Properties-Ultraman |website=4kidsentertainment.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228095359/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|archivedate=February 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Malaysia]] banned the printing of an ''Ultraman'' book because it compared the character of Ultraman King (from the film ''[[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]]'') with "[[Allah]]", the Arabic word for God, even though it is commonly used in [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] to refer to any "God". The [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] stated that the comparison may "confuse Muslim children and damage their faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stout|first1=David|title=A Japanese Superhero Is Apparently Destroying Malaysia|url=http://time.com/15265/ultraman-banned-malaysia-allah/|website=Time|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Ultraman Ginga S: Showdown! Ultra 10 Warriors!!]]'' and ''[[Ultraman X: Here It Comes! Our Ultraman]]'' were released on January 8, 2017 in the United States as a double feature; this was the first North American theatrical release of an Ultraman feature film in its entire 50-year history. ''Ultraman Max'', ''Ultraman 80'', ''Ultraman Neos'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraseven X'', ''The Ultraman'' and more series began airing in the United States on the [[Toku (TV network)|TOKU]] channel.

At the Tokyo Comic Con on December 7, 2017, Tsuburaya Productions revealed that an anime adaptation of the [[Ultraman (manga)|manga]] was planned for release in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Foywonder|title=Teaser Trailer for Ultraman CGI Anime Movie Coming in 2019|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/261737/teaser-trailer-ultraman-cgi-anime-movie-coming-2019/|website=Dread Central|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ultra multiverse==

Although the different Ultra series and movies take place in different continuities, that does not mean that they take place in different canons. A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'', and then again in ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'', when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film ''[[Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial]]'' when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse. In fact, the 2012 film ''[[Ultraman Saga]]'' takes place in four different universes.

==Licensing rights dispute==
Ultraman's [[licensing]] rights outside [[Japan]] have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co Ltd) based in [[Thailand]]. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, ''[[The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army]]'' and ''[[Jumborg Ace &amp; Giant]]''—the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, [[Jumborg Ace]]—in 1974. [[Sompote Sands|Sompote Saengduenchai]], founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976, the late Noboru Tsuburaya, Eiji's son, who had died in 1995, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan. The claim is rumored to have originated from a gamble held by a drunken Hajime Tsuburaya (Noboru's older brother) and Sompote Saengduenchai over the rights to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uni.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/rsfx/1143316019/|title=【三代目】円谷皐【次男】|publisher=Uni.2ch.net|date=|accessdate=2015-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928175420/http://uni.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/rsfx/1143316019/|archivedate=2015-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}

In spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed [[hanko (stamp)|hanko]] of the late Noboru Tsuburaya in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as ''[[Ultra Q]]'' being called ''"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q"'', ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' being called ''"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven"'', and Tsuburaya Productions being called "Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.

In the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on the said edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.

After an 8-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (''[[Ultra Q]]'' through ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'') and ''[[Jumborg Ace]]'' outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of said shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.

Tsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after Ultraman Taro, including the theatrical feature ''[[Ultraman the Next]],'' throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.

In 2005 the American company BCI Eclipse announced they had acquired the DVD rights to ''[[Ultraman]]'' from Chaiyo. A 3-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, and a second 3-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the original Japanese [[monaural]] dialogue track as well as the [[English language|English]]-dubbed version produced by [[United Artists]] for [[North America]]n syndication. At certain times, the English dialogue track switched over to the Japanese dialogue for small periods of time. This was because BCI had used audio from older recordings in which several scenes had to be cut or shortened for the American broadcast in order to fit running time constraints.  Tsuburaya Productions still held on to the complete original English dubbing materials, which they had obtained from a warehouse in 1997, and refused to provide them for BCI. (Contrary to BCI's statements, the original English dubs were complete and uncut, except for a small cut in the conclusion of Episode 36, "Gift From The Sky.")

During the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series he called "Project Ultraman", un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring his own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, [[Ekin Cheng]] to the project.

On August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to [[China]]. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened "The Ultraman Copyright Study Group" in response to the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|title=Ultraman in Dispute!|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/10/05/ultraman-in-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite. The defendants were also fined [[Thai baht|THB]] 15,000,000 (approx. [[Japanese yen|JPY]] 50,904,959 or [[United States dollar|USD]] 428,673.50 c.

Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

On February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman. The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the sole copyright owner. Sompote was also required to pay THB 10,700,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent a year starting from December 16, 1997, when the original lawsuit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final ruling in Ultraman case|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=6&amp;id=30064541|website=The Nation|accessdate=August 9, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215145850/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=6&amp;id=30064541|archivedate=February 15, 2008|date=February 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Thai Intellectual Property Court and the Tokyo District Court both ruled in favour of the Thai company. This led to the Tokyo District Court on September 30, 2010, ordering Tsuburaya Productions Co of Japan to pay damages of 16.36 million yen (Bt5.9 million) to Sompote Saengduenchai of Thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on Ultraman characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THE NATION Published on October 7, 2010 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/10/07/business/Thai-wins-Ultraman-copyright-case-in-Tokyo-30139555.html |title=Thai wins Ultraman copyright case in Tokyo |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104171724/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/10/07/business/Thai-wins-Ultraman-copyright-case-in-Tokyo-30139555.html |archivedate=January 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement of the ''[[Dragon Force: So Long, Ultraman]]'' movie in July 2017, the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aiken|first1=Keith|title=Chinese Ultraman Movie Latest Chapter in Ongoing Rights Dispute|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2017/07/28/chinese-ultraman-movie-latest-chapter-in-ongoing-rights-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in November 20, 2017, through a Los Angeles court ruling by judge Judge Andre Birotte Jr, Tsuburaya won the lawsuit against Chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between Noboru Tsuburaya and Chaiyo was "not authentic".&lt;ref&gt;http://henshinjustice.com/blog/2017/11/22/the-fate-of-ultraman-rights-tsuburaya-defeats-chaiyo-in-latest-court-battle/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-26/tsuburaya-productions-wins-case-for-ultraman-international-licensing-rights/.124333&lt;/ref&gt; Despite UM Corporation and Chaiyo filing a counter-dispute,&lt;ref&gt;http://henshinjustice.com/blog/2018/03/14/ultraman-rights-challenged-once-again-tsuburaya-productions-back-in-court/&lt;/ref&gt; on April 18, 2018, the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid, forbidding UMC to use the Ultra Series and all its related characters and forced them to pay Tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/news/395&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Washington Generals''' are an [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] team, best known for their spectacular losing streak in [[Exhibition game|exhibition games]] against the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. The team have also played under several different [[Pseudonym|aliases]] in their long history as the Globetrotters' perennial opponents.

==Function==
[[File:Harlem Globetrotters bring their basketball talents to Camp Foster 141206-M-XX123-001.jpg|thumb|400px|A Globetrotter beats a hapless Generals defender to score a spectacular [[slam dunk]]]]
The Generals exist primarily as a part of the Harlem Globetrotters' act, effectively being [[Straight man (stock character)|stooges]] for the Globetrotters. While the Globetrotters play tricks and spectacular displays of skill for the crowd, the Generals appear to attempt to play a "normal" game of basketball. The Generals' games involve playing genuine basketball at times, but also not interfering in the Globetrotters' tricks. Almost always this results in resounding wins for the Globetrotters.&lt;ref name="SB2015" /&gt; Despite their losses, the Generals' roster consists of relatively competent players.&lt;ref name="SB2015" /&gt; A recurring part of the act is the "guest General", where, for a short period, an invited person (usually a local celebrity) comes on court to play for the Generals.&lt;ref&gt; Examples of guest Generals can be found in:&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|title=Harlem Globetrotters at XL Center|url=https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Harlem-Globetrotters-at-XL-Center-293328731.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=NBC Connecticut|date=21 February 2015|language=en}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite news|title=The Harlem Globetrotters Tip Off|url=https://www.si.com/si-kids/photos/2016/01/12/harlem-globetrotters-tip|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=SI.com|date=7 October 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can exist multiple teams of Generals simultaneously, each following different touring Globetrotters teams.&lt;ref name="NBA2018" /&gt; 

While the Generals were closely associated with the Globetrotters, they were, for most of their history, an independent franchise owned by their founder, [[Red Klotz|Louis "Red" Klotz]]. In 2017 they were purchased from the Klotz family by Globetrotters' owners [[Herschend Entertainment]] and officially revived from a two-year hiatus.&lt;ref name="epsn_comeback"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rovell|first1=Darren|title=Generals make comeback as Globetrotters' foe|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/nba/story/_/id/19455306/washington-generals-purchased-herschend-entertainment|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=ESPN.com|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Generals were created in 1952 by [[Louis Klotz|Louis "Red" Klotz]], a former player for the [[Philadelphia Sphas]], a former ABL team that became one of the Globetrotters' exhibition rivals. Globetrotters owner [[Abe Saperstein]] had invited Klotz to create a squad to accompany his team on their tours, in part because the Sphas had beaten the Globetrotters on more than one occasion while serving as one of the Globetrotters' exhibition teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball's Greatest Jewish Team|last=Stark|first=Douglas|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a nod to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the team was named the Washington Generals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtongenerals.com/history|title=Get to know the history behind the Washington Generals|website=www.washingtongenerals.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Generals remained a continuous presence in the Globetrotters act from then on, however to give the illusion of variety they often played under a variety of different names with changes of uniform. During the 1971–72 season, the Generals' name was alternated with the "Boston Shamrocks", "New Jersey Reds", "Baltimore Rockets", and "Atlantic City Seagulls". The team rotated between these identities for a few seasons before going back to the Generals identity full-time. In 1995 Klotz "disbanded" the Generals and formed the "New York Nationals" which again was only a nominal change.
[[File:Harlem Globetrotters dribbling 04 (cropped).jpg|thumb|From 1995 to 2007 the team played as the "New York Nationals" in maroon jerseys]]
John Ferrari, the son-in-law of Klotz, took over as general manager of the team in 1987.&lt;ref name=epsn/&gt;

After a 12-year hiatus, the team returned to their Generals identity on October 9, 2007, playing against the Globetrotters at the [[369th Regiment Armory|369th Harlem Armory]]. The Globetrotters won 54–50.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/faq/#5 |title=The Official Site of the Harlem Globetrotters: FAQ Page |publisher=Harlemglobetrotters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105045431/http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/news/faq#5 |archivedate=2014-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monikers of "International Elite" and the "Global Select" were adopted prior to the 2011–12 World Tour. For the 2013–14 Harlem Globetrotters World Tour, the team took on the moniker of the "World All-Stars."

The Generals would occasionally play teams other than the Globetrotters. Among these games, which were competitive, they managed to record victories against the [[Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team|Taiwanese national team]] and a low-level Red Army team.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;

In 2015, the Harlem Globetrotters management chose to end contractual relations with the Generals organization, resulting in the Generals ceasing operations. The Generals played their last game against the Globetrotters on August 1, 2015 in Wildwood, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/washington-generals-folding-harlem-globetrotters/|title=Losers' Lament: After decades of defeat, the Washington Generals have lost for the final time|first=Joe|last=Posnanski|accessdate=August 14, 2015|work=NBC Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epsn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13433859/harlem-globetrotters-drop-washington-generals-primary-opponent|title=After 63 years, Globetrotters drop rival Generals as primary opponent|work=ESPN.com|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 14, 2015|first=Darren|last= Rovell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Globetrotters had defeated the Generals over 16,000 times in their combined history.&lt;ref name="SB2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Rodger|title=A requiem for the Washington Generals|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2015/8/14/9152971/washington-generals-harlem-globetrotters-losing-all-the-time|accessdate=8 March 2018|work=SBNation.com|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015 the Globetrotters' opposition was organised by their own management. In 2017, [[Herschend Family Entertainment]], the owners of the Harlem Globetrotters, bought the Washington Generals from the Klotz family and revived them as an active team with [[Kenny Smith]] as general manager and [[Sam Worthen]] as coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2711659-washington-generals-to-play-globetrotters-once-again-after-being-bought|title=Washington Generals to Play Globetrotters Once Again After Being Bought|first=Scott|last=Polacek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBA2018" /&gt; The Generals held a tongue-in-cheek "draft" where they selected various unavailable persons including [[LaVar Ball]] and [[Conor McGregor]].&lt;ref name="Generals_draft"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Draft Results {{!}} Washington Generals|url=http://www.washingtongenerals.com/news/2017-draft-results|website=www.washingtongenerals.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FTW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jospeph|first1=Andrew|title=The Washington Generals held a ridiculous draft that included LaVar Ball and Conor McGregor|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/washington-generals-draft-lavar-ball-conor-mcgregor-tbt|website=For The Win|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generals–Globetrotters transfers==
Very rarely Washington Generals players have been "promoted" to the Globetrotters. [[Derick "Dizzy" Grant]] was transferred in 2010&lt;ref name="dizzy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Sally|title=Lifelong hoop dream comes true for Harlem Globetrotter|url=http://www.southjerseylocalnews.com/entertainment/lifelong-hoop-dream-comes-true-for-harlem-globetrotter/article_219f4e26-7d02-5a26-b7f7-f07581c9bdc8.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=South Jersey Local News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Too Tall Hall|Jonte "Too Tall" Hall]] made the transition in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klingaman|first1=Mike|title=Harlem Globetrotters: Hall stands tall for traveling basketball team|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-03-23/sports/bs-sp-globetrotter-0324-20120320_1_harlem-globetrotters-washington-generals-too-tall-hall|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=tribunedigital-baltimoresun|date=23 March 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures vary as to exactly how often the Generals have beaten their rivals. Some reports say six,&lt;ref name="SCS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitley|first1=David|title=Globetrotters won’t have Washington Generals to kick around anymore|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20150816/SPORTS/150819713|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|date=16 August 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the team's official website reports having three victories over the Globetrotters, one each in 1954, 1958 and 1971.&lt;ref name="Official_history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Get to know the history behind the Washington Generals|url=http://www.washingtongenerals.com/history|website=www.washingtongenerals.com|accessdate=9 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971 win is the most storied of these, and is sometimes reported as the team's sole victory.&lt;ref name="SB2015" /&gt;

Playing as the "New Jersey Reds", they won 100–99 on January 5, 1971 in [[Martin, Tennessee]], ending their 2,495-game losing streak. Klotz credits the overtime win to a guard named Eddie Mahar, who was team captain.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Time the Globetrotters Came Up Short, Newsday (New York) February 17, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Harlem's captain, [[Fred Neal|Curly Neal]], did not play in this game.&lt;ref name=Arkansas&gt;"Curly Neal says he's an athlete first.", ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'' (Little Rock, AR), January 7, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Globetrotters were entertaining the crowd that day, they lost track of the game and the score. They found themselves down 12 points with two minutes left to go. Forced to play normal basketball, the Globetrotters rallied but could not recover.&lt;ref&gt;"Showtime in NBA Can Be Traced to Trotters", ''[[Sporting News]]'', March 12, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Reds secured their victory when the 50-year-old Klotz hit the winning basket with seconds left. Then [[Meadowlark Lemon]] missed a shot that would have given the game back to the Globetrotters. The timekeeper tried to stop the clock but couldn't. When the final buzzer sounded, the crowd was dumbfounded and disappointed.&lt;ref name=Courant&gt;"[http://articles.courant.com/2000-03-19/news/0003190083_1_harlem-globetrotters-new-jersey-red-ex-nba An Upset That Shook The Globe]", ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' (Connecticut), March 19, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Klotz described the fans' reaction: "They looked at us like we killed [[Santa Claus]]."

Some children in the stands cried after the loss.&lt;ref name=Arkansas/&gt; The Reds celebrated by dousing themselves with orange soda instead of champagne. Lemon was furious, saying, "You lost, I didn't lose," but still visited the opposing team’s locker room to congratulate the Reds.&lt;ref name=Courant/&gt;
