The '''1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident''', occurring on 14 September 1961, was an incident during the [[Cold War (1953–1962)|Cold War]], in which two [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|''JaBoG 32'']] of the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe'') crossed into East German [[airspace]] because of a navigational error, before landing at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]. The two planes successfully evaded a large number of Soviet fighter planes by finding cover in a heavy layer of clouds,&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45139958.html STRAUSS-BEFEHL: Bier-Order 61] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 9 May 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the actions of an airman at the [[United States Air Force]] air route traffic control center at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] who ordered the planes on to Berlin rather than forcing them to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; The event came at a historically difficult time in relations between the two Germanies. Only a month before, the [[Berlin Wall]] had been built, which completely cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from [[East Berlin]]. It also came three days before the [[West German federal election, 1961|West German federal election]], held on 17 September 1961.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Background==
At the time, violations of airspace at the border between West and East Germany were common, with, on average, two aircraft a month belonging to members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) crossing into Eastern airspace while a much larger number of Soviet planes crossed into that of West Germany. There were 38 violations of West Germany's air space by Soviet aircraft in a period of just four weeks between August and September 1961. Some of the violations were deliberate, to determine the opposite side's reaction, while others were by mistake, caused by the difficulty in determining the border line from the air.&lt;ref name="Monat" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45141349.html LUFTZWISCHENFALL: Zweimal monatlich] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 29 August 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the end of the Second World War and the [[German reunification]], West German planes were not permitted to fly to West Berlin, regardless of whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The three existing [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] to the city were only open to planes from the three wartime [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]: the United States, France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Tages" &gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/angriffshoehe-800/394316.html Angriffshöhe 800] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', published: 2 March 2003, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On 14 September 1961, under the code name ''Checkmate'', the [[NATO]] high command mobilised the air forces of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and West Germany for the purpose of an [[military exercise|exercise]]. As part of this exercise, the ''[[Jagdbomber]]''s of ''[[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|Jagdbombergeschwader (JaBoG) 32]]'', based at [[Lechfeld Airbase]], south of [[Augsburg]], were to fly a triangular route from [[Würzburg]] to [[Laon]] and then to [[Memmingen]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two F-84 fighter-bombers, flown by [[Feldwebel]] Peter Pfefferkorn and [[Unteroffizier|Stabsunteroffizier]] Hans Eberl,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qRFggA1sMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+Eberl+14+September+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DmhvySvrU0&amp;sig=fafOuilSu-d-gI-tp-thRCLE1m4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lOL1TKfHN4nprAfn0p32Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20Eberl%2014%20September%201961&amp;f=false Krieg um Berlin?: die sowjetische Militär- und Sicherheitspolitik] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Matthias Uhl, accessed: 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; lost their course in the process of flying this route, with the compass on Pfefferkorn's plane misreading by between 40 and 60 degrees. Additionally, a strong westerly wind was greater in strength than had been forecasted. On their way from Würzburg to Laon, the two pilots had become so disoriented that they mistook [[Liège]] in Belgium for [[Reims]] in France.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Shortly after, the pair were picked up by NATO radar stations near [[Warburg]], in southern [[Westphalia]], heading east, in the direction of [[Königs Wusterhausen]], south of Berlin. The two pilots missed a radio call from the radar stations advising them to turn around because they were talking to each other, trying to establish their location.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

It was only when reaching a position north of [[Leipzig]], deep within East German air space, that Pfefferkorn sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] signal, which was picked up, to their surprise, by the French-controlled airport at Tegel in [[West Berlin]], which gave them permission to land. The planes had initially not been noticed by the radar operator at the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] because he was concentrating on an incoming [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-6]]. By the time they were noticed, the pair were being unsuccessfully chased by a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. An airman in the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center ordered the two pilots not to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes but instead to head for the Tegel airport as it had a longer runway than Tempelhof and was more suitable for jets.&lt;ref name="Fifty"&gt;[http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf 50 Jahre Jagdbombergeschwader 32] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193436/http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }} {{de icon}} 50 Years Jagdbombergeschwader 32, accessed; 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the actions of this airman and the heavy cloud cover, which the two pilots used to conceal themselves, Pfefferkorn and Eberl escaped the pursuing Soviet aircraft and successfully landed their planes without further incident at Tegel.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Reaction==
===International===
Immediately after the two aircraft landed, the French authorities at Tegel airport explained to the Soviet authorities in East Berlin that, because of technical difficulties, an [[emergency landing]] of the two planes had been absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The then-West German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]], [[Franz-Josef Strauß]], apologised to the Soviet ambassador in [[Bonn]] for the incident, sending his secretary of state, [[Volkmar Hopf]]. The government of the Soviet Union remained silent for a number of days with regards to the incident, before officially protesting against the West German "provocation" and threatening to shoot down any aircraft involved if the incident was repeated.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The Soviet air command in East Germany was less than impressed with the 'unpunished' flight of two Western fighter planes through their airspace. However, it chose to blame bad weather for the incident rather than the failure of its ground control to guide the Soviet fighter planes on to the West German ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RYYuSGcwq5AC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+and+Eberl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VHqzsIhtcf&amp;sig=by3WlbzluCGCPMVwWI0WHSU6Fwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8P70TIfGFsGecfmj4dcE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20and%20Eberl&amp;f=false Vor dem Abgrund: die Streitkräfte der USA und der UdSSR] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Dimitrij N. Filippovych, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0033, Josef Kammhuber retusche.jpg|thumb|200px|Josef Kammhuber]]
[[Willy Brandt]], the leader of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] in the upcoming federal elections, and the mayor of West Berlin, questioned how the two pilots could be put in a situation where they would be forced to violate international conventions in a time of strained relations between the East and the West. Initially, Strauß announced a stringent investigation into the incident; instead, however, he and [[Josef Kammhuber]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], transferred the commander of ''JaBoG 32'', [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Siegfried Barth]], and announced that any commander whose unit committed a violation of international borders would be immediately replaced.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

When Kammhuber announced this order at Lechfeld the following day, it was dubbed ''Bier Order 61'' (''Beer Order 61'') because it was formulated late at night over drinks between Kammhuber and Strauß. Barth, commander of ''JaBoG 32'', was not questioned with regard to the incident, and was not allowed to speak during Kammhuber's visit. Instead, [[Generalleutnant]] [[Martin Harlinghausen]], Barth's superior officer, who had once, in 1944, stood up to [[Hermann Göring]], spoke for Barth and demanded a proper investigation.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two weeks later, Harlinghausen was forced into early retirement. The non-commissioned officers of ''JaBoG 32'' sent a letter to Strauß requesting that Barth should retain his command, without receiving any answer. Eventually, a proper investigation was conducted which found Barth to be innocent, a result unacceptable to Kammhuber, who initiated a second investigation that found the ''Oberstleutnant'' partly at fault. A third investigation followed, which again found Barth to be innocent. Oberstleutnant Barth then lodged an official complaint against Franz-Josef Strauß. Strauß, as minister of defence, ordered all witnesses in the case - Generals Kammhuber, Harlinghausen, [[Werner Panitzki]] and [[Werner Streib]] as well as Lieutenant Colonels [[Walter Krupinski]] and [[Walter Grasemann]] - [[gag order|not to speak]], as they were all military personnel and therefore under his command. Nevertheless, his conduct in dismissing Barth was found to be at fault, and the latter had to be reinstated in his position. Strauß, however, ignored this decision until [[Hellmuth Heye]], [[Ombudsman]] for the Military, forced him to accept it.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; Strauß himself was later forced to resign from his post as Minister of Defence, in the wake of the [[Spiegel scandal|''Spiegel'' scandal]] in 1962. Kammhuber retired from his post in the same year.

==Aftermath==
Upon arrival at Tegel, the two planes were immediately hidden in [[hangar]]s and journalists were prohibited from taking pictures of them.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; For years after, it was believed that the two planes had been repainted as aircraft of the [[United States Air Force]] and returned to West Germany by USAF pilots, or that they had been disassembled and transported back to the West in pieces.&lt;ref name="Tages" /&gt; The arrival of two massive [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124]] at Tegel from [[Frankfurt am Main]] also fuelled speculations that the two F-84s would be transported back in these aircraft.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; Another theory (which turned out to be true) held that the two aircraft were hidden by the French authorities at Tegel and, later, buried at the airfield, where they were accidentally rediscovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgmannschaft.info/forum/upload/showthread.php?t=1117 Luftraumverletzungen und -zwischenfälle über dem Gebiet der DDR]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{de icon}}, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exhibition at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr|Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin-Gatow]]'' in 2006, pictures of the two buried and then rediscovered Thunderstreaks at Tegel were shown, finally clearing up the question of what became of the two planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt;

The pilots of the two Thunderstreaks, Pfefferkorn and Eberl, were banned from flying and transferred to the ground crew at Lechfeld.&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The F-84F Thunderstreak, in service with the ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' since inception of the unit on 22 July 1958, was phased out of service on 13 July 1966, the ''Geschwader'' having accumulated over 80,000 flight hours with the planes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKI9zAJBsmB2e5ezvqRcNGglFR9b31fj_zcVP0A_YLciHJHR0VFAN5emug!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjBfT0tD?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB060000000001%2FW27G5DLE422INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' website – History] {{de icon}} accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 incident===
[[File:Hawker Sea Hawks of the West German Marineflieger in August 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Marineflieger-Geschwader 1]]
Eleven months after the F-84 incident, the Soviet threat of to shooting down any aircraft violating the border materialized when a [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'', piloted by [[Kapitänleutnant]] Knut Anton Winkler, was shot at by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters when it accidentally crossed into East German airspace near [[Eisenach]]. Winkler, who had been returning from a training exercise on board {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} in the Atlantic Ocean, had to carry out an emergency landing at [[Ahlhorn]], 45&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The aircraft was eventually written-off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/veith/seahawk.htm  DDR-Luftwaffe.de – Sea Hawk] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler himself died less than four years later in a [[F-104 Starfighter]] accident on 10 May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cactus-starfighter-staffel.de/public/html/in_memoriam.html In Memoriam] List of German pilots killed in F-104 Starfighter accidents, accessed: 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmates of Abu Salim prison==
*[[Ahmed al-Senussi]], a current member of the NTC, was held here by Gaddafi until his release in 2001.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |last=Stock |first=Johnathan |title=Gaddafi-Opfer Al-Senussi: Gott entscheidet, was mit dir passiert |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |accessdate=25 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=13 March 2011 |agency=SPIEGEL-Verlag |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DGwSOUj?url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |archivedate=2011-08-25 |language=German |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

==Libyan civil war==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=RAW,Libya, Rebels and citizens setting prisoners free from Abu Salim Priso in Tripoli 24.08.2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHy2jmVocQ |work=[[YouTube]] |author=FreePressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter [[Matthew VanDyke]] from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in [[Brega]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=American fighting Kadhafi 'lunatics' dreams of free Libya |first=Jay|last=Deshmukh |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 October 2011 |work=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggq9gizU50QT6TMAe6WPD-7Xytrw?docId=CNG.63f3ecd569de01fd9d60c41e9a017daa.931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/25/libya.freed.american/|title = American held in solitary escapes Tripoli prison|author = Phil Gast|work = CNN|date =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a "writer and journalist," but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10562">'''Anthrax hoaxes''' involving the use of white powder or labels to falsely suggest the use of [[anthrax]] are frequently reported in the United States and globally. [[Hoax]]es have increased following the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], after which no genuine anthrax attacks have occurred. The [[FBI]] and [[United States Postal Inspection Service|U.S. postal inspectors]] have responded to thousands of "white powder events" and targets have included government offices, US embassies, banks and news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/08/nation/na-anthrax-threats8|title=Anthrax hoaxes pile up, as does their cost|last=Drogin|first=Bob|date=8 March 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=The Anthrax Letters: A Bioterrorism Expert Investigates the Attacks That Shocked America--Case Closed?|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-715-6|url=http://leonardcole.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boutique Week''' is a bi-annual shopping event in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. Boutique Week was launched in October 2010 in New York, Boston, and Los Angeles with over 40 [[boutiques]] participating in each city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919143430/http://www.boutiqueweek.net/ |archivedate=2010-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the participating boutiques offers their merchandise at a discount of at least 25% off during the selected week.

==support==
Boutique Week is supported by local government in these cities as an effort to stimulate the economy and raise awareness for small local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view%3Dpage%26pageId%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023054400/http://boutiqueweek.net/index.php?view=page&amp;pageId=3 |archivedate=2010-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page%3Dhappenings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708081449/http://boldfacers.com/index.cfm?page=happenings |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boutique Week also raises money for [[Nancy Lublin]]'s non-profit organisation [[Dress For Success (organization)|Dress for Success]], supplying women with [[interview suit]]s and resources they need for success in today's workforce.

==Founders==
Boutique Week was founded in July 2010 by Polina Raygorodskaya and Olga Vidisheva.

Polina Raygorodskaya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polinafashion.com|title=NYC Fashion PR, Marketing, Fashion Public Relations|website=www.polinafashion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the founder and president of Polina Fashion LLC. Formerly a top [[runway model]], Raygorodskaya earned a [[BS degree]] in [[Business Administration]] at [[Babson College]].  Her entrepreneurial endeavors have been recognized by [[Fox Business Channel]] and [[LegalZoom]]. In 2007, [[Business Week]] named her as one of the "Best 25 Entrepreneurs Under 25".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/oct2007/sb20071019_394343_page_2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/business-management/success-stories/hottest-young-entrepreneurs|title=The Hottest Young Entrepreneurs of 2008|date=1 December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olga Vidisheva is currently pursuing a [[Masters degree]] in Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]]. Most recently, she worked for [[Chanel]] in their 'Fashion' and 'Fragrance and Beauté' marketing divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20100914/Harvard+Goes+High+Fashion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918031704/http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20100914/Harvard%2BGoes%2BHigh%2BFashion |archivedate=2010-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catastrophism''' was the theory that the [[Earth]] had largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turney |first=C.S.M. |last2=Brown |first2=H. |year=2007 |title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe |journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=26 |pages=2036–2041 |bibcode= 2007QSRv...26.2036T |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (sometimes described as [[gradualism]]), in which slow incremental changes, such as [[erosion]], created all the Earth's [[geology|geological]] features. Uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as [[erosion]]) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the [[scientific consensus]] accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Catastrophism held that [[geological epoch]]s had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid [[orogeny|formation of major mountain chains]].  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were [[extinction|made extinct]], being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of [[Noah's flood]].

The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist [[Georges Cuvier]], who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="McG 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133" /&gt;

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
{{Main article|history of geology}}
In the early development of [[geology]], efforts were made in a predominantly [[Christian]] western society to reconcile biblical narratives of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Universal Flood Myth#Jewish|universal flood]] with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was "stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the [[Greeks]]", an example being [[Plutarch]]'s account of the [[Universal Flood Myth#Ogyges|Ogygian flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvardnb|King|1877|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. His motivation was to explain the patterns of [[extinction]] and [[faunal succession]] that he and others were observing in the [[fossil]] record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="McG 3"&gt;{{Harvardnb|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the intellectual climate of the [[French revolution]], avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier also believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast in Britain, where [[natural theology]] was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including [[William Buckland]] and [[Robert Jameson]] interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title ''Theory of the Earth''. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Buckland abandoned [[flood geology]] in favor of the [[glaciation]] theory advocated by [[Louis Agassiz]], following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] and an understanding of the immense stretch of [[geological time]], or as the concept came to be known [[deep time]], were found in the writing of [[James Hutton]], sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] ("The present is the key to the past") and [[gradualism]] (''geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time'') and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with [[religion]] and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered [[Miracle|miraculous]] rather than natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 [[J Harlen Bretz]] published a paper on the [[channeled scablands]] formed by glacial [[Lake Missoula]] in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Velikovsky's views===
{{Main|Velikovskyism}}
In the 1950s, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet [[Venus]] is a former "[[comet]]" which was ejected from [[Jupiter]] and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current [[orbit]]. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical [[Ten Plagues|plague]]s of [[Egypt]], the biblical reference to the "Sun standing still" for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of [[Atlantis]]. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krystek |first1=Lee |title=Venus in the Corner Pocket: The Controversial Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/velikov.htm |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goudie |first1=A. |year= |title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |page=709 |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. This paper suggested that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Impact event|struck Earth]] 66 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].

Since then, the debate about the [[extinction]] of the dinosaurs and other [[mass extinction]] events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Comparison with uniformitarianism===
One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |year=2007 |chapter=Uniformitarianism |chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |archivedate=2006-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon-formation===
{{Main|Giant impact theory}}
Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large [[moon]] was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in ''Icarus'' in 1975, [[William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]] proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large [[planetesimal]] early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the [[Moon]], thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Gott III |first=J. R. |year=2005 |title=Where Did The Moon Come From? |journal= [[The Astronomical Journal]] |volume= 129 | issue=3 | pages= 1724–1745 |arxiv=astro-ph/0405372 |bibcode=2005AJ....129.1724B |doi=10.1086/427539 |last1=Belbruno |first2=J. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact theory does have some faults; some computer simulations show the formation of a ring or multiple moons post impact, and elements are not quite the same between the earth and moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= |first1= |date=September 2009 |title=Moonwalk  |url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/webdav/site/GSL/shared/pdfs/Geoscientist/Download%20PDF%20copy%20of%20Geoscientist%2019.9%20September%202009.pdf |publisher=[[Geological Society of London]] |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Binder |first1=A.B. |year=1974 |title=On the origin of the Moon by rotational fission |journal=[[The Moon]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=53–76 |bibcode=1974Moon...11...53B |doi=10.1007/BF01877794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stevenson |first1=D.

'''''Chase's Calendar of Events''''' is an annual American publication, started in 1957 by brothers William (Bill) D. Chase (a [[journalist]] and [[publisher]] from [[Michigan]]), and Harrison V. Chase (a university [[social scientist]] from [[Florida]]).&lt;ref name="nyt-2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/30holi.html | title = Having a Snack?

The brothers gathered information on events and the first edition of 2,000 copies was printed for 1958. "It was 32 pages, contained 364 entries and sold for $1", while recent editions are 752 pages and contain more than 12,000 entries.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; A promotion sponsored by the US Chamber of Commerce was added in 1958: a pamphlet listed commercial promotions as Special Days, Weeks and Months, and remained in future editions.&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; Contemporary Books in Chicago, Illinois, took over publication in 1983 and the Chases retired in 1987 from compiling the calendar, which is now handled by an in-house staff of editors and researchers. Contemporary Books was acquired by [[Tribune Media|Tribune]] in 1993 and sold to [[McGraw-Hill Companies]] in September 2000. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Tribune acquisitions: Tribune Co. said Tuesday it reached...| work = tribunedigital-chicagotribune| accessdate = 2016-08-02| url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-06/news/9307070173_1_contemporary-books-tribune-distribution-of-interactive-multimedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGraw/&gt; McGraw-Hill sold the property to [[Rowman and Littlefield|Rowman and Littlefield Publishing Group]] in January 2015, where it is now published by Bernan Press, an imprint of RLPG. &lt;ref&gt;Rowman and Littlefield press release, Jan 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irish potato famine Bridget O'Donnel.jpg|thumb|An 1849 depiction of Bridget O'Donnell and her two children during the famine.]]
The '''Chronology of the Great Famine''' ({{lang-ga|'''An Gorta Mór'''}}&lt;ref&gt;The term has appeared in the titles of numerous books on the event, as demonstrated by [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22Gorta+Mo%CC%81r%22&amp;=Search&amp;qt=results_page this search on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''An Drochshaol'', litt: ''The Bad Life'') documents a period  of Irish history between 1845 and 1852&lt;ref&gt;Kinealy (1995), xvi–ii.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity, Gill &amp; Macmillan (1994), {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[proximate cause]] was [[famine]] resulting from a potato disease commonly known as [[late blight]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, ''Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives'', Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Ireland{{spaced ndash}}where a third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for food{{spaced ndash}}was exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain the subject of historical debate.

An important and controversial point of debate, that is notable amongst Irish people, was that Irish food supplies were sufficient until it was taken away by the British the feed the British, and the landlords kept economic benefits to themselves. Some commentators and writers controversially compared this explanation to "genocide".

&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith, ''The Great Hunger'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991, p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-14-014515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, pp. xvi–ii, 2–3. {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==

===1845===

====August====
At the beginning of August, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the British Prime Minister, received news of a potato disease in the South of England. This was the first recorded evidence that the 'blight' which had ravaged the potato crop in North America in 1843-1844 had crossed the Atlantic. Cecil Woodham-Smith would write that a failure in England would be serious, but for Ireland, it would be a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39&lt;/ref&gt;

====September====
Following earlier reports of incidences of the blight in England, on 13 September 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity'', Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7171-4011-3}} pg.32 put the date at the 16th&lt;/ref&gt; potato blight was first reported in Ireland. The crops at Dublin were suddenly perishing, it was reported in the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'', asking "where will Ireland be in the event of a universal potato rot?"  The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

====October====
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|[[Skibbereen]] 1847 by [[Cork (city)|Cork]] artist [[James Mahony]] (1810–1879), commissioned by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
*As soon as digging of potato crops began, devastating reports started coming in. Sir Robert Peel found the accounts 'very alarming' and writing to Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary on 13 October reminded him that there was always a tendency in Irish news to exaggerate.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.41&lt;/ref&gt; Constabulary Reports from the 15 reported great failures, Sir James Graham, the Home Secretary wrote that the truth about the potato crop, until digging was completed, could not be fully ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.42&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]] was prompted to act,&lt;ref&gt;''The Course of Irish History'' (1994) edited by T.W.Moody and F.X.Martin. Page 268. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|1-85635-108-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 15 October he decided to summon an emergency meeting of his Cabinet for 31 October. The remedy he decided was to repeal the [[Corn Laws]].&lt;ref name="cws-p50"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.50&lt;/ref&gt; Peel then decided to set up a Scientific Commission to go to Ireland and investigate the potato blight and report on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.44&lt;/ref&gt;
*The emergency Cabinet meeting met on 31 October till 1 November. The first day consisted of reading reports and memoranda from Ireland on the potato failure. Peel proposed that a relief commission be established in Ireland, and a sum of money be advanced to the Lord -Lieutenant. Differences arose when Peel pointed out that these measures required an advance of public money. The purchase of food for destitute districts would open the question of [[Corn Laws]]. Was it possible, it was asked, to vote public money for the sustenance of a people on account of "actual or apprehended scarcity" and still maintain restrictions on the free import of grain; Peel declared it was not.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'' pg.51&lt;/ref&gt; On this issue then the Cabinet split, the overwhelming majority voting against Peel.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland's Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, Dublin: University College Dublin Press, 2006, p. 7. {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to reach a decision, the Cabinet adjourned till 6 November.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;

The principle of the Corn Laws had been to keep the price of home-grown grain up. Duties on imported grain assured English farmers a minimum and profitable price. The burden of a higher price for bread was carried by the labouring classes, in particular factory workers and operatives. It was claimed that if the Corn Laws were repealed all those connected with the land would be ruined and the established social organisation of the country destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

According to Cecil Woodham-Smith, the rising wrath of Tories and landlords ensured "all interest in Ireland was submerged."  She writes that the Tory Mayor of Liverpool refused to call a meeting for the relief of Irish distress. She continues that the [[Mansion House Committee]] in Dublin was accused of 'deluding the public with a false alarm', and the blight itself 'was represented as the invention of agitators on the other side of the water'. The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the domestic issue of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, "slipped into the background."&lt;ref name="cws-p50"/&gt;

====November====

*On 9–10 November&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 54&lt;/ref&gt; Peel ordered the secret purchase of £100,000 worth of [[Maize|Indian corn]] and meal from America for distribution in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.38, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.49&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November the Scientific Commissioners reported that half the potato crop had been destroyed.&lt;ref name="cws-p51"/&gt;
*On 19 November the Mansion House Committee in Dublin claimed to have "ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt that considerably more than one-third of the entire potato crop...has been already destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, Jr, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing 2005, UK, {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}} pg.43&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 20 November the Relief Commission first met.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52, Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 57&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unable to persuade his Cabinet to repeal the Corn Laws, on 5 December Peel tendered his resignation &lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg.37&lt;/ref&gt; to Queen Victoria but was reinstated days later when [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] was unable to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846===
The first deaths from hunger took place in early 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keneally (1999) ''The Great Shame''. London: Vintage: 110&lt;/ref&gt; In March Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 78–86&lt;/ref&gt; The new Whig administration under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]], influenced by their [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 408–11&lt;/ref&gt; then halted government food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work, money or food.&lt;ref name="david2002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 224, 311&lt;/ref&gt; Grain continued to be exported from the country.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works, although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; The blight almost totally destroyed the 1846 crop and the Famine worsened considerably.&lt;ref name="david2002"/&gt; By December a third of a million destitute people were employed in public works.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===1847===
[[File:Emigrants Leave Ireland by Henry Doyle 1868.jpg|thumb|''Emigrants Leave Ireland'', engraving by Henry Doyle (1827–1892), from Mary Frances Cusack's Illustrated History of Ireland, 1868]]
There were average crop yields in the 1847 harvest, but due to lack of seed potatoes to plant, the crop was low.&lt;ref&gt;Líam Kennedy, Paul S. Ell, E. M. Crawford &amp; L. A. Clarkson, Mapping The Great Irish Famine, Four Courts Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-85182-353-0}} pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; Crowds began to throng the public works during the last months of 1846 and the start of 1847, which promoted exactly the social conditions for the spread of 'famine fever.'&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.173&lt;/ref&gt; In late January and February, legislation called the Temporary Relief Act went through the British parliament; it became popularly known as the Soup Kitchen Act and occasionally as Burgoyne's Act.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 136&lt;/ref&gt; This system of relief was designed to deliver cheap food directly and gratuitously to the destitute masses. This system of relief would be terminated in September.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg. 81–85&lt;/ref&gt; The government also announced an additional change in the system of relief. After August 1847, the permanent Poor Law was to be extended and was to become responsible for providing relief and as a result, all relief would be financed by the local Poor Law rates.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy, ''This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845–52'', Dublin: Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7171-1832-0}} pg 137&lt;/ref&gt; This put impossible loads on local poor rates, particularly in the rural west and south.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 174–187&lt;/ref&gt; With the mass emigration of the famine era, the horrors of the '[[coffin ships]]' and 1847 have ever since been associated in the popular mind, according to James S. Donnelly.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Donnelly, JR, ''The Great Irish Potato Famine'', Sutton Publishing (UK 2005 RP), {{ISBN|0-7509-2928-6}}, pg.179&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1847 The [[Crime and Outrage Bill (Ireland) 1847]] was enacted due to growing Irish nationalist agitation that was causing the British government concern about a possible [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|violent rebellion]] against British rule in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, Cecil [[The Great Hunger]] Ireland1845 1849 Harper and Row   New york pages 326-327&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill gave the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] the power to organise the island into districts and bring police forces into them at the districts' expense. It limited who could own guns, and required all of the men in the district between the ages of 16 and 60 to assist in apprehending suspected murderers when landlords were killed, or else be guilty of a misdemeanour themselves.

===1848===
The blight returned in 1848 and outbreaks of cholera were reported.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Evictions became common among the Irish who could not keep up with the demands of their British landlords. Famine victims on outdoor relief peaked in July at almost 840,000 people.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; On 29 July [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|an uprising against the government]] was led by [[William Smith O'Brien]]. After a skirmish at "[[Famine Warhouse 1848|Widow McCormack's house]]" in the village of [[Ballingarry, South Tipperary|Ballingarry]], [[County Tipperary]] the leaders of the rebellion fled to America or were sentenced to transportation.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kee (2000) ''The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism'': 270-89&lt;/ref&gt;

===1849===
The potato crop failed again in 1849 and famine was accompanied by cholera outbreaks.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; This deadly cholera epidemic killed one of Ireland's greatest poets: [[James Clarence Mangan]].&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt;

===1850===
The Famine ended.&lt;ref name="david20022002"&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===1851===
By 1851 census figures showed that the population of Ireland had fallen to 6,575,000 – a drop of 1,600,000 in ten years.&lt;ref name="david20022002"/&gt; Cormac Ó Gráda and Joel Mokyr have described the 1851 census as a famous but flawed source. They contend that the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete and biased count" of fatalities during the famine.&lt;ref name="cormac2006"&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda, Ireland’s Great Famine: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, University College Dublin Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904558-57-7}} pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The famine left in its wake up to a million dead and another million emigrated.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross (2002) ''Ireland: History of a Nation'': 226&lt;/ref&gt; The famine caused a sense of lasting bitterness by the Irish towards the British government, whom many blamed — then and now — for the starvation of so many people.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Woodham-Smith (1962) ''The Great Hunger: Ireland 1845-9'': 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; The fall-out of the famine continued for decades afterwards.

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

[[Image:Displace me X.jpg|thumb|Promotional poster]]

'''Displace Me''' was a nationwide event hosted by the nonprofit [[Invisible Children Inc]]. on April 28, 2007. In 15 cities across the [[United States]], 68,000 individuals came together to raise awareness about the situation of the [[Displaced persons camp|displacement camps]] in northern [[Uganda]].

The event had three main goals:
#To educate participants about displacement camps in the North by simulating, as best as possible, the experience of living in an IDP camp.
#To create greater national and international attention of the humanitarian crises in northern Uganda.
#To garner the political attention needed to see a peaceful resolution to the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]], primarily through the appointment of one senior level U.S. diplomat.

==The event==
Displace Me was created to be an experiential event. To encourage the simulation, participants were asked to bring the following:
*Enough cardboard to build something the size of a small tent.
*A sleeping bag.
*A 1.5-liter bottle of water (with an airtight seal—to be collected upon entry).
*A box of saltine crackers (with sealed packaging—to be collected upon entry).
*A current photo of you wearing a white T-shirt with a red X.

With 15 locations across the United States, participants had to travel long distances to reach their “camps.” The traveling aspect was reflective of the displaced individuals in northern Uganda who were given 48 hours to leave their homes and relocate to displaced camps throughout the region. Once Displace Me participants arrived at their camps, they built “huts” out of cardboard boxes. Throughout the remainder of the night, participants were rationed food and water and heard, via video, personal testimonies from those living in the IDP camps in the North.

Other aspects of the event included a speech at every city from an individual personally connected with the conflict. Speakers included the Gulu District Chairman [[Norbert Mao]], Invisible Children’s Ugandan Country Director '''Jolly Okot''', and the Senior Adviser to the International Crisis Group [[John Prendergast (activist)|John Prendergast]], among others. First Lady [[Laura Bush]] also directly addressed the Displace Me participants via a prerecorded speech shown on video. Participants concluded the night by writing letters to their government leaders and the President of Uganda, calling friends and family who were not aware of the conflict, as well as holding 21 minutes of silence for the 21 years of war.

During the night participants also helped film a video that was to be shown to members of the [[United States Senate]]. Participants in each city held up giant banners with their city's name and one to two phrases from the below statement.

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204025130/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]. [[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

'''Global Wind Day''' is a [[international observance|worldwide event]] that occurs annually on [[15 June]].  It is organised by EWEA ([[European Wind Energy Association]]) and GWEC ([[Global Wind Energy Council]]).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102949362881&amp;ca=e882c25a-f468-49fe-b235-801f5a25f67a GWEC Media Release: The local impact of wind energy in the spotlight on Global Wind Day]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a day when [[wind power|wind energy]] is celebrated, information is exchanged and adults and children find out about wind energy, its power and the possibilities it holds to change the world. 
In association with EWEA and GWEC, national wind energy associations and companies involved in wind energy production organise events in many countries around the world. In 2011, there were events organised in 30 countries, on 4 continents. Events included visits to onshore and offshore wind farms, information campaigns, demonstration turbines being set up in cities, wind workshops and a wind parade. Many events happened on Global Wind Day (15 June) itself, but there were also events on the days and weeks before and afterwards. In 2012 there were 250 events around the globe and a very popular photo competition. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/how-to-celebrate-global-wind-day-on-june-15-2293785.html |title=How To Celebrate Global Wind Day on 15 June|date=2011-06-06|publisher = The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==2007==
The inaugural year of Wind Day (it did not become Global Wind Day until 2009) was organised by EWEA. The main idea was to coordinate events organised by national wind energy associations and companies active in the wind energy field. Wind Day in 2007 reached 18 countries in Europe, with a participation of around 35,000 people.

==2008==
Wind Day 2008 reached 20 European countries and attracted 100,000 people.

==2009==
This was the first year that EWEA joined forces with GWEC and extended the reach from European wind energy associations and companies to coordinate Wind Day events across the globe (and changing the name to Global Wind Day). In 2009 there were 300 events in 35 countries, reaching 1 million people.

In 2009 in Portugal the Wind Day was celebrated with an event called Wind Parade. It was organised in the city of Cascais just in front of the ocean. This project aimed to promote renewable energy good practices and in particular Wind Energy. It was supported by the City Council and conceived by Energia Lateral and implied the installation of 7 skstream micro wind turbines in a very visible place by the sea in June–July 9. One of the purposes was to involve children in the event and they were invited for a contest to decorate/paint small dummy wind turbines. Over 50 applications were submitted by 30 schools. The winner decorated a dummy wind turbine with Don Quixote elements comparing his fight against the windmills but in this case the wind mills being allies of Don Quixote in an epic effort to improve the environment.

==2010==
In this year, 220 events took place in 30 countries, including the display of a 29.5 metre (96.7&amp;nbsp;ft) wind turbine blade in Brussels, Belgium, next to the main building of the [[European Commission]] and [[European Council]]. More than 1 million people were reached by Global Wind Day communications around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/topics/m/video/56693102/global-wind-day-2010.htm|title=Global Wind Day 2010|date=2010-06-15|publisher=renewableenergyworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Global Wind Day Wind Parade.jpg|thumb|Global Wind Day Wind Parade, Brussels 2011]] --&gt;

In [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], the home of EWEA and GWEC, a wind parade in [[Place de Luxembourg]] educated people working in the [[European Union|EU]] area on the benefits and importance of wind energy.

Global Wind Day events happened in 30 countries around the world in 2011. Some examples include:
In [[France]] there were 15 events, ranging from wind farm inauguration to a jobs-in-the-wind-industry question and answer session. 
In [[Austria]], journalists leapt from the top of a turbine and abseiled to the ground. 
In [[Japan]] there were 10 events, involving field trips to wind farms, experimental wind energy facilities and making wind turbines from a kit. 
In [[Australia]], an open day at a wind farm was available, with a community evening to finish off the day. 
In [[Mexico]], a public street fair featured a drawing competition for kids and a display of wind energy history.

==2012==

Global Wind Day partners organised 250 events around the globe in 2012, from wind farm open days to workshops, from
photo exhibition to regattas, from kite-flying to charity runs. For the first time, this included events in
[[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]] and [[South Africa]].
Global Wind Day 2012 gained the support of 18 GWD Ambassadors,who were joined by the Danish Presidency of the EU and the United Nations. Kandeh K. Yumkella, the Director-General of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), and the leader of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative said, ‘We need to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This can be achieved with significant contribution from wind energy, both grid connected andfor small-scale decentralised systems. The ‘Global Wind Day’ on 15 June, does play a central role in contributing to the UNSG’s Sustainable Energy For All initiative through galvanising the much needed support for the wind energy industry from political leaders around the globe’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalwindday.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GWD_report_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The ‘Wind in Mind’ photo competition saw 2,300 photos from over 40 countries submitted.

==2018==
For 2018, WindEurope and GWEC launched a global photo competition to capture the power of wind in the run up to Global Wind Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/photo-competition/ Global Wind Day Photo Competition “Wind Vision” 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/wind-vision-photo-competition-winners/ Wind Vision Photo Competition Winners (in all 3 categories)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently the Offensive Coordinator for the University of Tennessee. He is the former head coach of the [[University of Mississippi]]. Freeze served as the head football coach at [[Lambuth University]] from 2008 to 2009 and at [[Arkansas State University]] in 2011. He was previously a successful high school football coach at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he coached [[Michael Oher]] and [[Greg Hardy]]. He would later follow both of them to the University of Mississippi.

==Early life==
Freeze attended [[Senatobia Municipal School District|Senatobia High School]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], from which he graduated in 1992 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[mathematics]] and a minor in coaching and [[sports administration]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.astateredwolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&amp;ATCLID=204944063 Hugh Freeze Bio], Arkansas State University, retrieved December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Briarcrest Christian School===
In 1992, Freeze joined the staff at [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], as the football team's [[offensive coordinator]] and [[defensive backs coach]]. Freeze also served as dean of students.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giannotto |first1=Mike|title=At Briarcrest Christian School, Hugh Freeze's legacy is everywhere |url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/sports/2017/07/24/briarcrest-christian-school-hugh-freezes-legacy-everywhere/506677001/ |work=The Commercial Appeal|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he was promoted to head coach. Freeze ran the no huddle spread offense and led his team to the state championship twice, in 2002 and 2004, and the regional championship each year from 1995 to 1998 and in 2001 and 2002. He received Region 8-AA Coach of the Year honors five times and Associated Press Coach of the Year honors six times.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In ten years at Briarcrest, Freeze was 94–30 as head coach (.785 winning percentage) and 126–37 overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213161936/http://briarcrest.com/page.aspx?pid=821 |archivedate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze was depicted in [[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game|the book]] and motion picture ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'', about one of his former players, current free agent offensive tackle [[Michael Oher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/40483873/ns/sports-college_football/ Oher's HS Coach Gets Top Job at Arkansas State], NBC Sports, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Briarcrest Christian School, Freeze also coached the girls basketball team from 1992 to 2004, and actually had more success in this role, with an overall record of 305–63 (.829 winning percentage), seven straight championship appearances, and four championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/sports/ncaafootball/hugh-freeze-coach-at-ole-miss-follows-an-unlikely-blueprint.html|title=Hugh Freeze, Coach at Ole Miss, Follows an Unlikely Blueprint|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his dismissal from [[Ole Miss]], some former students alleged that Freeze had engaged in inappropriate conduct with female students while at Briarcrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heim|first1=Mark|title=Hugh Freeze stories emerge from former female students at Briarcrest Christian|url=https://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/07/hugh_freeze_stories_emerge_fro.html|work=AL.com|date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peter|first1=Josh|title=Who is Hugh Freeze?

===Ole Miss===
In 2005, the [[University of Mississippi]] hired Freeze as an assistant athletic director for football external affairs. The following season, he became the [[tight ends coach]] and [[recruiting coordinator]], positions he held through 2007.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; After [[2007 Ole Miss Rebels football team|that season]], he replaced head coach [[Ed Orgeron]] on an interim basis before the hiring of [[Houston Nutt]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Freeze interviewed for the offensive coordinator position with Nutt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtok.com/sports/headlines/13665882.html |title=Nutt Has Long List for New OC |date=January 9, 2008 |work=WTOK.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that eventually went to [[Kent Austin]].

===Lambuth===
In January 2008, [[Lambuth University]], a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), named Freeze its head coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambutheagles.com/article/252.php Hugh Freeze Named Lambuth University Head Football Coach], Lambuth University, January 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he led Lambuth to an 8–4 record and a first round loss in the NAIA playoffs, marking their first appearance in the playoffs since 2004 under then head coach Vic Wallace. He was considered for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's head coaching position following the 2008 season, but remained at Lambuth University for another season and compiled a 20–5 overall record, and defeating opponents 41–17 on average. In 2009, he led the Eagles to their best regular season record in school history with an unblemished 11–0 mark. Lambuth advanced to the second round of the NAIA playoffs for first time in 11&amp;nbsp;years—having won one game before suffering elimination to finish 12–1 as the sixth-ranked team in the NAIA.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

===Arkansas State===
In 2010, he joined the staff at [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] as offensive coordinator after a brief stint as offensive coordinator at [[San Jose State University]] under [[Mike MacIntyre]]. The Red Wolves finished with a 4–8 record, but their offensive rankings jumped from 95th in total offense and 90th in scoring offense in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I FBS]] to 43rd and 46th, respectively. The Red Wolves' offense broke nine school records including total plays (856), first downs (262), pass attempts (438), pass completions (266), completion percentage (.607), passing yards (3,057), passing yards per game (254.8), and passing touchdowns (23). The Red Wolves' offense averaged 403.4 yards per game, eclipsing over 300 yards all 12 times it took the field for the first time in the history of the program. A-State posted at least 400 yards of total offense in seven games during the 2010 campaign, the most ever as an NCAA FBS member, all in his first year as offensive coordinator. After [[2010 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|the season]], Freeze was promoted to replace head coach [[Steve Roberts (American football)|Steve Roberts]].&lt;ref name=hired&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5875374&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NCFHeadlines Hugh Freeze hired at Arkansas St.], ESPN, December 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, his only season as head coach at Arkansas State, he led the Red Wolves to a 10–2 record and their first Sun Belt Conference title since 2005. The Red Wolves' offense averaged 447.8 ypg (28th nationally, 1st in Sun Belt Conference) including 293.6 ypg passing and 154.2 ypg rushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109125126/http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/arkansas-state/2011.html |archivedate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeze left Arkansas State before the Arkansas State's appearance in the [[GoDaddy.com Bowl]] following the season.

===Ole Miss===
On December 5, 2011, Freeze was announced as the 37th head coach of the University of Mississippi. During the press conference to introduce Freeze as the head coach, he stated that he wanted to "retire at Ole Miss." He was signed to a four-year contract with an annual salary of $1.5 million plus incentives up to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="FreezeOMHire"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hugh Freeze is Rebels' new coach |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7319777/hugh-freeze-mississippi-rebels-emotional-accepting-coaching-job |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first season at Ole Miss, Freeze led the Rebels to a 6–6 record in the regular season, making Ole Miss bowl eligible for the first time since 2009 with a 41–24 victory over Mississippi State in the [[Egg Bowl]]. His Rebels accepted a bid to play in the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama, on January 5, 2013. They beat the University of Pittsburgh 38–17 to finish 7–6.

Freeze received national attention on [[National Signing Day]] 2013 as Ole Miss brought in the fifth ranked recruiting class in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/classrankings?class=2013 |title=2013 Football Class Rankings |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeze won the 2014 Grant Teaff Coach of the Year award by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org/2014/01/13/hugh-freeze-named-grant-teaff-coach-of-the-year/ |title=Hugh Freeze named coach of the year by Fellowship of Christian Athletes |work=FCA.org |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Freeze's third season at Ole Miss, he led the Rebels to a 7–0 start, the program's best start since the [[Johnny Vaught]] era. By October, they had risen as high as third in the nation, their highest ranking at that late stage in the season in almost half a century. They ultimately finished 9–3, only the third time since Vaught's tenure that Ole Miss has won that many games in the regular season. That netted them an appearance in the [[2014 Peach Bowl]]–their first major bowl appearance since the [[1970 Sugar Bowl]], and easily the biggest bowl they had attended since Vaught's tenure.

On September 19, 2015, Freeze's Rebels beat Alabama, 43–37, in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], making Freeze only the third head coach, along with [[Les Miles]] and [[Steve Spurrier]], to defeat a [[Nick Saban]]-coached team in back-to-back years (Michigan's Lloyd Carr beat Saban's Michigan State Spartans in three consecutive years, '96–'98). The victory catapulted the Rebels to #3 in the AP rankings. They went on to tally their second straight nine-win season, and garnered a berth in the [[2016 Sugar Bowl]], where they won 48–20 over [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]]. They finished ninth in the AP Poll and 10th in the Coaches' Poll—their first top-10 finishes in a final poll since 1969.

In January 2016, the NCAA charged Ole Miss with numerous recruiting violations. An investigation turned up evidence that Ole Miss employees and boosters arranged numerous "impermissible benefits" for players, such as car loans and cash. At least one recruit was suspected of getting help on his college entrance exam.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/2/22/14703296/ole-miss-ncaa-allegations-list-2017|title=The updated list of 21 NCAA allegations against Ole Miss football|author=Morgan Moriarty|publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date= February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The investigation reopened soon after star offensive tackle [[Laremy Tunsil]] admitted taking money from one of Freeze's assistants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laremy Tunsil says he took money from coach at Ole Miss |work=ESPN |date=April 28, 2016 |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/15424437/2016-nfl-draft-laremy-tunsil-admits-taking-cash-ole-miss-rebels-coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017—three months after suffering its first losing season since the year Freeze arrived—Ole Miss withdrew from bowl consideration for the upcoming season. The move came on the same day that the NCAA sent an updated notice of allegations charging the Rebels with eight additional violations. Most seriously, it accused Freeze of not monitoring his assistants, and also accused Ole Miss of not properly controlling the program.&lt;ref name=SBNviolations/&gt;

On July 13, 2017, Freeze's predecessor, [[Houston Nutt]], sued Ole Miss for defamation, contending that Freeze and school officials falsely blamed him for the violations. As part of discovery for the lawsuit, Nutt's attorneys filed a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request for calls Freeze made on his university-issued cell phone during January 2016. Nutt's attorneys contended that Freeze and others at Ole Miss leaked information to the press as part of an effort to smear their client.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-bc-fbc--mississippi-freezes-downfall-20170721-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

While reviewing those records, Nutt's attorneys discovered a call to a number associated with a female [[escort service]], and alerted Ole Miss officials about it.  Freeze claimed it was a misdialed number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2017/07/20/ole-miss-coach-hugh-freeze-called-number-tied-escort-service/498056001/|title=Ole Miss football coach Hugh Freeze made call to number tied to escort service|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; School officials investigated, and discovered what they later described as "a concerning pattern" of similar calls dating back to shortly after he arrived in Oxford. On July 20, chancellor [[Jeff Vitter]] and athletic director [[Ross Bjork]] gave Freeze an ultimatum: resign or be fired for violating the [[morals clause]] of his contract. Freeze opted to resign; offensive coordinator [[Matt Luke (American football)|Matt Luke]] was named interim coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited |title=Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze resigns; escort-service calls cited |last=Schlabach |first=Mark |date=July 20, 2017 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |author-link=Mark Schlabach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arizona Hotshots (AAF)===
On October 11, 2018, Freeze was named as the Offensive Coordinator for the [[Arizona Hotshots]] of the [[Alliance of American Football]].

'''Human response to [[disaster]]s''' has been recorded throughout human history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  In ancient times disasters were often perceived as a result of a deity, divine being, or spiritual creature showing their displeasure over human behavior.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This later changed as humans began to see disasters as natural events that caused physical destruction and social chaos to individuals, communities, and societies as opposed to responses to human actions.

The term "disaster myth" has been created to describe the belief that people will behave in an irrational, uncontrolled, and even extreme manner outside of normal and accepted social standards despite evidence that proponents state prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;John Drury, David Novelli, and Clifford Stott, “Psychological disaster myths in the perception and management of mass emergencies: Psychological disaster myths,” ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', 43 (2013): 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Aptekar, ''Environmental Disasters in Global Perspective'' (New York: G.K. Hall &amp; Co., 1994), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the term further state that people will only act irrationally in the direst of circumstances when terrible danger is imminent and no avenue of escape appears available. They argue that these disaster myths cause a negative impact when they cause people, officials, and disaster-relief organizations to make detrimental or incorrect [[disaster response|disaster planning and response]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panic/Scared ==
One commonly held disaster myth is that people develop an insurmountable, illogical fear in the face of a [[disaster]].  In turn, this fear becomes infectious, spreads to others, and causes people to flee without thinking and in a chaotic manner that could hurt those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, just the opposite can be expected in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when experiencing the increased stress from an [[earthquake]], since they arrive unannounced and it is not known when the aftershocks will end, people continue to act rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only do few people panic, most are unwilling to participate in an organized evacuation.  Those who live in the disaster area tend to stay in place.  The only ones who usually flee are the visitors, tourists, and transients.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Disaster]]s also draw people to the area.  Some want to help while others just want to see the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public and organizations involved in [[emergency management|emergency planning, management, and response]] all tend to accept this disaster myth as reality.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S191-S192.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Panic]]king can cause harm to others if people flee without thought.  Staying put can be even worse since the people are not getting away from the [[disaster|disaster’s]] damage and destruction.  When necessary, people should evacuate in an orderly manner to avoid the [[disaster]].  It also provides an opportunity to help others evacuate who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] can cause officials to be cautious when issuing public bulletins.  By not wanting to instigate or amplify the believed [[panic]], officials may wait too long to provide the information on which the populace should act.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid contributing to or increasing the level of this mythical [[panic]], officials have also chosen to not share information about preparations for some types of [[disaster]]s (e.g. [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare|biological]] attacks).&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of the panic myth was seen with Orson Welles’ [[The War of the Worlds]] radio broadcast in 1938, the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire]], and as [[Hurricane Carla]] approached the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rational behavior also dominated after [[earthquake]]s in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite many reports of widespread [[panic]], evidence later proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The myth of [[panic]] affecting the official warnings of authorities has been seen in Mexico when the Rio Grande River flooded, in Italy during the [[flood]]ing of the city of Florence, and after a volcanic eruption in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the instances when authorities chose to send the military instead of humanitarian organizations in response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], it was in some part to help manage and control the perceived [[panic]] among the population.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shock ==
Many people believe those who experience a [[disaster]] firsthand experience emotional trauma that has both immediate and lasting effects.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought the initial devastation of the [[disaster]] leaves people too fragile and in [[Acute stress reaction|shock]].&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, they are unable to cope with their situation or participate in recovery efforts.  They are consequently dependent on assistance from outside relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a small minority of cases does this myth turn out to be true.  And many times, the experienced shock is short-lived.  What in fact happens in most cases is people react immediately to the [[disaster]] and its effects.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[disaster]] can also be a jolt of energy which drives people to respond to the emergency.&lt;ref&gt;Claude de Ville de Goyet, “Stop Propagating Disaster Myths,” ''The Lancet'', 356, no. 9231 (August 26, 2000): 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who went through the [[disaster]] are the first engaged in relief and rescue efforts before any outside agency.  They come together along familiar lines such as family and friends and then move as needed to a larger scale involving groups with which they associate (e.g. churches).  If the familiar cannot be contacted or they are unable to respond, only then do most people look toward the faceless law enforcement, welfare, and relief organizations for assistance.  People will also seek help from outside the familiar when special equipment or medical skills are required.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of widespread shock leads outside relief organizations to plan their efforts as if they are the only ones who will be providing assistance.  This may create a disconnected rather than complementary relationship between them and the local agencies.  Additionally, the feeling on the part of the survivors that they do not need to rely on outsiders coupled with the relief organizations believing they are saviors creates a wall between the two which in turn inhibits communication, coordination, and effective relief and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

People’s reliance on self and the well-known was seen in a variety of disaster types such as the [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado|1953 tornado in Flint-Beecher, Michigan]], the 1955 flood of Marysville and Yuba City, California, [[Hurricane Audrey]] in 1957, [[Hurricane Carla]] in 1961, [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965, and the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both in [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|Mexico City in 1985]] and in [[1999 Izmit earthquake|Turkey in 1999]], thousands of local residents banded together to search for fellow victims in the earthquake wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neighbors performed more than half of the rescue activities after the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] hit Kobe City, Japan in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistance ==
People believe the population impacted by a [[disaster]] are unable to do anything about their situation so are standing by just waiting for the saviors from afar to swoop in with the solution to all of their suffering.  Not only that, relief organizations often think the aid must be provided immediately.  This myth is especially pervasive when the [[disaster]] strikes a third-world country and it is a “superior” western country coming to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762-763.&lt;/ref&gt;

While relief organizations with emergency managers, medical teams, and the like do offer assistance after a [[disaster]], most people are actually saved by other survivors and local authorities, agencies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this myth, more supplies are often sent than the disaster area typically needs.  In addition to excess quantity, much of the supplies end up being of little to no use.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relief organizations often do not wait for an assessment of the disaster area and an identification of needs which can be provided by local officials or performed by themselves.  As a consequence, money is often wasted on sending unneeded teams of experts or supplies when local authorities and victims would benefit more if that same money was allocated towards providing resources that filled gaps and complemented their efforts.  Donors compound the issue by donating used clothing, household items, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;  With too many supplies on-hand or in possession of supplies they cannot use, local officials are forced to waste manpower and resources on disposing of them.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of providing unwanted and unrequested goods, organizations and donors should send money which can be more easily applied to fulfilling local needs.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this myth’s impact was seen following the [[1993 Hokkaidō earthquake]] as authorities were forced to spend 1.2 million in U.S. dollars on the removal of unnecessary relief supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S193.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
Outside rescue, relief, and recovery agencies almost always miscalculate the amount of available resources for basic needs that are available locally in the aftermath of a [[disaster]].  They believe there are not enough materiel, supplies, and personnel for the initial response.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, there are usually enough supplies to last several weeks.  Enough food can normally be found in stores, warehouses, and people’s homes.  Clothing is rarely needed.  Medical supplies reside in hospitals, warehouses, or nearby communities.  Hospitals as well as police and fire departments often transition to 24-hour operations.  And no evidence is available that proves the unfound belief that key personnel will leave their posts to go attend to their families and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relief agencies tend to believe they must act immediately rather than assess the situation first.  As a result, they often provide supplies when there is already enough on-site for the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
The prevalence of [[looting]] in the wake of [[disaster]]s is another common myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that [[disaster]]s provide cover for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, people take advantage of law enforcement and other agencies responsible for maintaining the peace, safety, and security being occupied with disaster response and relief efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  People believe criminals will use the [[disaster]] as an opportunity to loot due to a prevalence of evacuated, abandoned, and unguarded homes and stores.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[looting]] can occur, they are always isolated incidents.  And much reported [[looting]] is either entirely false or, at worst, desperate survivors scavenging for necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

But because people believe [[looting]] happens, they frequently refuse to leave despite the disaster’s destruction and damage in order to protect their homes and property.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  When no [[looting]] occurs, people tend to believe it is because enough security was in place to prevent it rather than looters did not exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, officials who believe in this myth end up assigning personnel to a protection role rather than to a much more critical rescue, relief, or logistics support function.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 763.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of connection between [[disaster]]s and [[looting]] was seen in the rates for theft and burglaries actually falling after [[Hurricane Betsy]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This myth’s impact was also seen outside the United States as evidenced by many Guatemalans staying after the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake]] out of fear of having their animals, homes, and possessions stolen.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morale ==
People tend to believe that survivors are extremely negative after a disaster and need to assurance that the outside world cares and the future is bright for themselves and their community.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, people are most often optimistic and have very high [[morale]] in a disaster’s aftermath.  They frequently subordinate any personal feelings of loss and suffering in order to apply themselves to providing food, shelter, and other services to those in need.  Their motivation to help one another boosts the sense of community and togetherness.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the myth, dignitaries and officials feel the need to come to the disaster area to reassure the survivors.  They often make promises of aid that either are not kept or do not happen in a timely manner.  This can cause survivors to resent outsiders.  This resentment in turn can prevent the survivors from asking for needed skills and resources that the outsiders can in fact provide.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
When a [[disaster]] results in deaths, especially in large quantities, people often believe they are at considerable risk of catching a [[disease]] from them.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also believe [[epidemic|disease epidemics]] develop in the wake of [[disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that they died from the [[disaster]] does not make them a risk for spreading [[disease]]s.  If a body does carry a [[infection|communicable disease]], the person already had it when he or she was alive.  The fact that the body is now stationary and will remain in one place makes it less of a risk than prior to death.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  And an [[epidemic]] would happen only if either of two circumstances exist:  1) the [[disaster]] brings [[disease]] with it for which the people are not immune or 2) the disaster’s effects lead to [[malnutrition]], the [[malnutrition]] increases susceptibility to [[disease]], and finally, a large number of people contract the [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in the myth can result in the hurried disposal of the bodies without proper identification, burial, or involvement by the next of kin.  This can add to the suffering of survivors because they were not allowed to properly care for their loved ones.  In addition to the personal toll, needlessly disposing of dead bodies can divert personnel and supplies from other areas where at that time they are needed more (e.g. involved in actions that benefit those still living).&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear or rumor of an [[epidemic]] can also cause relief organizations to provide medicines, resources, and other aid for a problem that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth has been repeated many times such as in the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua]], [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, the [[1999 Izmit earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]], and the [[2000 Mozambique flood|2000 flooding in Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, rumors of [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[dysentery]], and [[typhus]] that were later proven to be false followed the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976 earthquake in Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetuation of myths ==
[[File:Hydra1.gif|thumb|Myths Live On]]

=== By people ===
People who have experienced a [[disaster]] often believe the dramatic accounts of their own suffering.  It allows them to pass off their actions as atypical and heroic.  In the process of telling others about their involvement, the mythic component of their story is spread along with the reality.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster survivors tend to worry about [[looting]].  Their increased anxiety can cause them to spread reports whether they definitely know of any or not.  While most people who are asked admit to not having personally witnessed or experienced [[looting]], many claim of being aware of it elsewhere.  The belief in [[looting]] can make people jump to the conclusion that looting was the cause of items going missing before considering the [[disaster]] may have moved, buried, or destroyed them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By organizations ===
Government agencies, civilian organizations, and [[first responder]]s all believe to some extent in disaster myths.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2266.&lt;/ref&gt;  When this happens, the myths in turn are often included in their [[disaster response|planning and response]] to [[disaster]]s, victims, and survivors.  And practices based even partially on disaster myths are not only likely to result in inappropriate or inefficient relief and response actions, they can also help to perpetuate the myths thereby affecting people and property in the next [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 2269.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of how organizations can perpetuate disaster myths takes place in the days following a [[disaster]] and up until official numbers are compiled.  During this time, officials from emergency, relief, rescue, and welfare organizations can overestimate the loss of life and destruction of property.  This sheds a more positive light on their organizations since they can point to effective emergency procedures and local heroism as the reason their figures turned out to be higher than the actual numbers.  If their calculations end up being lower than the official figures, they might be blamed for incompetence and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the inability to cope by a disaster-site’s community and people is a myth, it continues to be believed.  One reason is the justification relief agencies give while promoting the assistance they provide.  They feel they are needed because they believe facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, and other local first responders do not have the capacity to meet the sheer demand from a disaster.  And if their efforts do not go as planned, they often point to survivors’ irrationality rather than reassess the assumptions on which they developed their relief plans.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local, regional, and national officials make up a primary source of information for the media.  In the self-imposed small window the media has to get out the latest details of the disaster, fact-checking sometimes suffers and they rely solely on the officials' accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, officials substantially influence the media's portrayal and what viewers, listeners, and readers see.  An example of this is seen in officials highlighting the positives within their own organization's efforts while downplaying the information from and activities by unofficial groups and sources.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Goltz, "Are the News Media Responsible for the Disaster Myths? A Content Analysis of Emergency Response Imagery," ''International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 2'', no. 3 (1984): 365-366.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by the media, law enforcement officials frequently say they are taking sufficient action to prevent [[looting]] even if they have taken no action on the issue.  If the norm happens and little to no [[looting]] occurs, they may be credited for the absence of crime.  But if the exception to the rule happens, they do not want to be blamed for not protecting against the [[looting]].  Whether it is true or not, people believe local law enforcement is out keeping the area secure from looters and the myth continues to propagate.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By media ===
Many myths are perpetuated by the mass media to include newspapers, television, radio, and internet news.&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is largely due to the way they portray [[disaster]]s.  In fact, most people base their opinions and beliefs regarding [[disaster]]s and survivor behavior on what they see in the media.  The media strives to keep their viewers’ and readers’ attention for as long as possible.  Drama and destruction is interesting and compelling; most of everything else is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the most part, the media, regardless of country, takes a fairly standard approach to disaster coverage and reporting.  Immediately after the [[disaster]], they rely on statistics of destruction and damage followed by stories of victims and those providing the rescue and relief.&lt;ref&gt;Aptekar, 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media repeatedly moves away from discussing the [[disaster]] as a whole to focusing on individual parts and the drama involved in them.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of its manner in covering [[disaster]]s, the media may capture only pieces instead of the entire event while emphasizing the unusually heroic or unusually tragic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A main focus of media coverage centers on [[emergency management]] organizations performing rescue and relief actions in the disaster area.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 364-365.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media frequently portrays international relief teams as angels saving the victims from the disaster's destruction while simultaneously implying the local officials are negligent, inept, or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;de Goyet, 762.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this backdrop, the portrayal of a breakdown in society and social behavior is more likely to appear in coverage of [[disaster]]s occurring outside the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this type of portrayal that helps perpetuate disaster myths involves the frequent reports of people panicking in both small and large numbers to the point of fleeing when faced by an oncoming [[disaster]] such as a [[hurricane]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when the international media noticed few stories of [[looting]] coming out of [[Japan]] following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan Disaster in 2011]], they generally remarked on how well the Japanese people behave.  By believing in this myth, they assumed the Japanese showed more behavioral control than other societies rather than understanding it rarely happens in association with any [[disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Nogami and Yoshida, S192.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)
* [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]], between Venezuela and the United Kingdom
* [[Fashoda Incident]] (1898–1899)
*[[Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03]], between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy
* [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (1904–1906)
*[[Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908]], between Venezuela and the Netherlands
* [[Bosnian crisis]] (1908–1909)
* [[Agadir Crisis]] (1911)
* [[Åland crisis]] (1916–1920)
* [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] (1936)
* [[Anschluss]] (1938)
* [[May Crisis 1938|May Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Iran crisis of 1946|Iran crisis]] (1946–1947)

An '''international incident''' is a seemingly relatively small or limited action or clash that results in a wider dispute between two or more [[nation-states]]. International incidents can arise from unanticipated actions involving citizens, government officials, or armed units of one or more nation-states, or out of a deliberate but small provocative action by [[espionage]] agents of one nation-state, or by [[terrorists]], against another nation-state.

An international incident usually arises during a time of relative [[peace]] between nation-states, and in general is, on the surface, an unexpected event. Conflicts that grow out of a series of escalating [[skirmish]]es between nation-states generally are not considered international incidents; however, [[terrorist]] actions can and often do become international incidents. However, historical views of past international incidents often reveal the incident was the flashpoint of a simmering conflict between nation-states, or organizations opposing nation-states.

Wars have often been provoked by international incidents, and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts to prevent international incidents from growing into full-scale armed conflicts often have been unsuccessful. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the [[League of Nations]] was established to help nations who were parties to an international incident achieve a solution to the incident through diplomatic means. Initially, the League of Nations had some success in working to find diplomatic solutions, however the failure of the League of Nations to prevent [[World War II]] resulted in the disbandment of the League of Nations in favor of the [[United Nations]]. As with its predecessor, the United Nations provides a means by which nations involved in an international incident can work to resolve the matter diplomatically rather than through the use of force.

The term is also applied to various incidents that can disrupt international [[commerce]], and to [[celebrities]] or other well-known people who commit [[gaffe]]s or otherwise act inappropriately, causing the [[Mass media|press]] and sometimes governments to criticize their actions.

The [[International Court of Justice]] keeps a list of legal disputes between nation-states, many of which result from international incidents. The [[Royal Mail]] of the [[United Kingdom]] keeps a list on its website of current international incidents that might disrupt mail service.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/service-update/international Royal Mail – International Incident Bulletin].  Retrieved March 12, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents listed may or may not conform to the definitions given above.

'''Jessica McClure Morales''' (born March 26, 1986) became famous on October 14, 1987, at the age of 18&amp;nbsp;months after she fell into a [[water well|well]] in her aunt's backyard in [[Midland, Texas]]. Between that day and October 16, rescuers worked for 56 hours to free her from the {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on|spell=in}} [[casing (borehole)|well casing]] {{convert|22|ft|m}} below the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc13.com/30-years-ago-rescue-of-baby-jessica-from-the-well/1555516/|title=30 years ago: Rescue of 'Baby Jessica' from the well|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/18-month-old-girl-saved-1987-article-1.2386153|title=Jessica McClure, an 18-month-old girl, is saved after 58 long hours trapped in a well in 1987 - NY Daily News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained worldwide attention (leading to some criticism as a [[media circus]]), and later became the subject of a 1989 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television movie ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]''.

== Rescue ==
McClure's rescue proved to be a much more difficult ordeal than was first anticipated.  Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling another shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil-drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the  shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the [[jackhammer]]s used were designed for drilling downward, rather than sideways. A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. TV viewers watched as paramedics and rescuers, drilling experts and contractors worked tirelessly to save the baby's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard Jessica singing “[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]” from deep in the well. As long as she was still singing, they knew she was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Darla|title=Baby Jessica 30 Years Later: 'My Life Is a Miracle'|url=http://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-30-years-later-my-life-is-a-miracle/|accessdate=15 October 2017|website=People.com|date=31 May 2017|quote=Television viewers watched as hundreds of paramedics, rescuers, drilling experts and contractors feverishly worked to save the baby's life.

The relatively new technology of [[Water jet cutter|waterjet cutting]], used to cut through the hard rock surrounding the well, was a vital part of the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Week|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-0dAQAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Science Foundation (U.S.)|title=Annual report for fiscal year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EEc-gZcTJkC|year=1987|publisher=The Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Short, a muscular roofing contractor who was born without collar bones because of [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] and so could collapse his shoulders to work in cramped corners, arrived at the site and offered to go down the shaft. They considered his offer, but did not use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= J.

Midland Fire Department paramedic Robert O'Donnell was ultimately able to inch his way into the tunnel and wrestle McClure free from the confines of the well, handing her to fellow paramedic Steve Forbes, who carried her up to safety.

== Media coverage ==
[[CNN]] was on the scene with around-the-clock coverage of the rescue effort. This massive media saturation of the ordeal prompted then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] to state that "everybody in America became godmothers and godfathers of Jessica while this was going on."

From the beginning and throughout the incident, the switchboard of local media outlet [[KMID-TV]] was flooded with telephone calls from news organizations and private individuals around the world, seeking the latest information on rescue efforts. In some cases, they shared their own insight into this and similar incidents.

In 1988, McClure and her parents appeared on ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'' to talk about the incident.

The photograph of McClure being rescued fetched the [[1988 Pulitzer Prize|1988]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography|Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]] to Scott Shaw of the ''[[Odessa American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988 |title= 1988 Winners and Finalists |work= The Pulitzer Prizes |publisher= Columbia University |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC made a television movie of the story in 1989, ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]'', starring [[Patty Duke]] and [[Beau Bridges]]. It featured many participants in the actual rescue and its coverage as extras.

On May 30, 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'' ranked McClure number&amp;nbsp;22 on its list of "25&amp;nbsp;lives of indelible impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koch |first=Wendy |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/top25-people.htm |title=Lives of Indelible Impact |work= [[USA Today]] |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following McClure's rescue on October 16, 1987, surgeons had to amputate a toe due to [[gangrene]] from loss of circulation while she was in the well. She also has a scar on her forehead where her head rubbed against the well casing. She had 15 surgeries over the years and has no first-hand memory of the event.&lt;ref name=Blaney&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www9.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |last= Blaney |first= Betsy |title= Baby Jessica turns 25, gains access to trust fund |work= Xfinity News |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= March 25, 2011 |accessdate= March 25, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110326215656/http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |archivedate= March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced a few years after the rescue.

Paramedic Robert O'Donnell, battling [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] as a result of the arduous rescue effort and struggling to cope with the abrupt decline of the fame and recognition that had been lavished on him following his heroic act, committed suicide in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belkin|first1=Lisa |title=Death on the CNN Curve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/magazine/death-on-the-cnn-curve.html |accessdate=July 18, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=July 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McClure graduated from [[Greenwood Independent School District|Greenwood High School]], in a small community near Midland, in May 2004. On January 28, 2006, nineteen-year-old McClure married Daniel Morales at [[Church of Christ]] in [[Notrees, Texas]], about 40 miles from Midland. They met at a day care center where she worked with his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Celizic |first= Mike |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19165433/ |title= Baby Jessica 20&amp;nbsp;Years Later |publisher= [[MSNBC]] |date= November 6, 2007 |accessdate= November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, a boy born 2007 and a girl born 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-on-the-30-year-anniversary-of-her-rescue-from-a-well-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom/|title=Baby Jessica On the 30 Year Anniversary of Her Rescue from a Well: Her Life as a Wife and Mom|first=Steve|last=Helling|date=October 16, 2017|publisher=[[People magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When McClure turned 25 on March 26, 2011, she received a [[escrow|trust fund]] of donations worth up to $800,000. Her father said she had discussed setting up a trust fund for the college education of her children. It had earlier helped in the purchase of her present home, which is less than {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from the site of the incident.&lt;ref name=Blaney /&gt;

* In the 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', a heavily fictionalized version of the Jessica McClure story plays out in TV and radio newscasts throughout the film. The entire nation is transfixed as a nine-year-old boy named "Ricky Newman" is believed to have fallen down a well in Fresno, California. Rescuers similarly dig a second well parallel to the one they think he is in, but James Cole (Bruce Willis) tells Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that the boy is, in fact, hiding in a barn. He is later proven right. He knows this because he is a time traveler and remembers the events from when he was a child.

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;

|The Battle of Cajamarca was the unexpected [[ambush]] and seizure of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] ruler [[Atahualpa]] by a small Spanish force led by [[Francisco Pizarro]], on November 16, 1532. The Spanish killed thousands of Atahualpa's counsellors, commanders and unarmed attendants in the great plaza of [[Cajamarca]], and caused his armed host outside the town to flee. The capture of Atahualpa marked the opening stage of the conquest of the [[pre-Columbian]] Inca civilization of Peru.

|[[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day]] (1835)&lt;br/&gt;"Massacre at Paris" (1600)&lt;ref&gt;Notable for the historically first use of "massacre" in the name of an event, by Marlowe (c. 1600); the name used by Marlowe was "The massacre at Paris". The now-current name of "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day" dates to the first half of the 19th century (Francis Alexander Durivage, ''A Popular Cyclopedia of History'', 1835), translating French 
''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{sort|America North|[[Boston]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]}}
|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

This is a '''list of serious injuries and deaths''' in which one or more subjects of a [[selfie]] were killed or injured, either before, during or after having taken a photo of themselves, with the accident at least in part attributed to the taking of the photo.

The [[United States Department of Transportation]] estimated that during 2014, the so-called "year of the selfie",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/tech/twitter-selfie-trend/index.html|title=Twitter declares 2014 year of the selfie|last=CNN|first=Naomi Ng, for|website=CNN|access-date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ie/trends/2014/story/selfies.html|title=The year of the selfie|website=www.google.ie|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 33,000 people were injured while driving and using a cell-phone in some fashion, which can include talking, listening, and "manual button/control actuation" including taking, uploading, downloading, editing, or opening  of selfies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812260 |title=Distracted Driving 2014 (DOT HS 812 260) |publisher=DOT NHTSA |author= |date=April 2016 |access-date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 survey by [[Erie Insurance Group]] found that 4% of all drivers admitted to taking selfies while driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/romantic-encounters-behind-the-wheel-are-a-driving-distraction/2015/03/30/f76c8baa-d3f1-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html |title=Flossing, selfies, romantic encounters: Driving distractions, by the numbers |work=Washington Post |author=Ashley Halsey III |date=March 30, 2015 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported in January 2016 that "about half" of at least 27 "selfie related" deaths in 2015 had occurred in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/01/14/more-people-die-taking-selfies-in-india-than-anywhere-else-in-the-world/|title=More people died taking selfies in India last year than anywhere else in the world&amp;nbsp;— The Washington Post|date=14 January 2016|access-date=6 March 2016|author=Annie Gowen|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; No official data on the number of people who died taking selfies in India exists, but reports show from 2014 up to August 2016, there have been at least 54 deaths in India while taking selfies.&lt;ref name="ht" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Tourism (India)|Indian Ministry of Tourism]] asked states to identify and barricade ‘selfie danger’ areas, its first national attempt to deal with the selfie deaths. [[Mumbai Police]] identified at least 16 danger zones after a man drowned attempting to save a selfie-taker.&lt;ref name="ht"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-no-selfies-allowed-in-front-of-national-memorials-from-august-12-18/story-8BrHFgmxKpnvOUzdsT6U1N.html |title=Freeze frame: States asked to spot ‘selfie danger’ areas  |work=Hindustan Times |author= |date=August 10, 2016 |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No-selfie zones were also established in certain areas of the [[Kumbh Mela]] because organizers feared bottlenecks caused by selfie-takers could spark stampedes.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

A 2018 study of news reports showed that between October 2011 to November 2017, there were 259 selfie deaths in 137 incidents reported globally, with the highest occurrences in India followed by Russia, United States, and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bansal |first1=Agam |last2=el al |title=Selfies: A boon or bane? |journal=Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care |date=July 2018 |doi=10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_109_18 |pmid=30234062 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131996/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean age was 22.94 years old with male deaths outnumbering female about three to one.

In [[journalism]], '''local news''' refers to coverage of events, by the [[news]], in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Louis Anthony McCall Sr.''' (December 28, 1951 – June 25, 1997) was an American singer, songwriter, drummer, and [[event planner]]. McCall is best remembered as the co-founder and drummer of the American [[Funk]]/[[R&amp;B]] band [[Con Funk Shun]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.last.fm/music/Con+Funk+Shun LastFM - Con Funk Shun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Confunkshun.html Soulwalking - Con Funk Shun]&lt;/ref&gt; which gained fame during the 1970s and 1980s with R&amp;B songs such as: "[[Ffun]]" (1978), "Chase Me" (1979) and "Baby I'm Hooked (Right into Your Love)" (1983). McCall's wife is music business consultant and songwriter Linda Lou McCall. In 1997, McCall was murdered in a home invasion robbery at age 45.

==Career==
===Con Funk Shun===
Louis A. McCall Sr. and singer/guitarist Michael Cooper formed Con Funk Shun as high school students in [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=saG0kc0lG7wC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=louis+mccall&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj47pbn-NLUAhWM7IMKHTO-Di04FBDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=louis%20mccall&amp;f=false African Americans in Vallejo – By Sharon McGriff-Payne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxtrafoxxmusic.com/con_funk_shun/|title=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC – Con Funk Shun|work=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC|date=2007-2014|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding members Karl A. Fuller, Paul A. Harrell, Cedric A. Martin, [[Felton C. Pilate]] and Danny A. Thomas, the band started out as a backing group for the [[Soul Children]] under the name Project Soul. They began working with [[Stax Records]] staff songwriters, and while [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] at Audio Dimensions, a sound studio in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, producer Ted Sturges both named the group (after an [[instrumental]] recording by [[The Nite-Liters]]) and produced their first album, ''Organized Con Funk Shun''.

In 1976, Con Funk Shun signed to [[Mercury Records]], releasing eleven albums over a span of ten years. The group's 1977 album, ''Secrets'', was certified [[gold album|gold]] in the U.S., as were ''Loveshine'' (1978), ''Candy'' (1979), and ''[[Spirit of Love]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Search for "Con Funk Shun" performed at [[RIAA]].com on December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They scored a string of [[Top 40|top ten]] [[hit single|hits]] on the [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] black singles [[record chart|chart]], including "Ffun" (#1 in 1977), "Shake and Dance with Me" (#5 in 1978), "Chase Me" (#4 in 1979), "Got to Be Enough" (#8 in 1980) and "Too Tight" (#8 in 1981). Tensions from within the group built over the 1980s, and the group's final album, ''Burning Love'', was recorded without songwriter and vocalist [[Felton Pilate]], who had left Con Funk Shun following a physical altercation involving McCall.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; The band let McCall go after he missed two concert dates in order to deal with medical problems resulting from a teenage car crash.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; After leaving Mercury Records, the band broke up in 1986, but some members of the group reunited alongside touring musicians for concerts in the 1990s.

===Later career===
After leaving Con Funk Shun in 1986, McCall joined forces with his wife, a music business consultant, and started an artist management company in the [[Washington, DC]] area. In 1989, they discovered [[Keith Martin (musician)|Keith Martin]], an aspiring R&amp;B artist, and signed on as his managers. When Linda Lou McCall was hired by rapper [[MC Hammer]] in 1990, the McCalls put Martin on Hammer's ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em]]'' tour as a backup musician and vocalist, which launched Martin's career in the music industry. In 1992, Linda Lou formed her own company, The Entertainment Qartel, Inc. (EQartel), specializing in music business administration and entertainment marketing and promotions.&lt;ref name=LindaLou&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exxtrafoxxmusic.com/linda_lou_mccall.html|title=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC – Linda Lou McCall CEO|work=Exxtra Foxx Music LLC|date=2007-2014|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to doing radio promotion for EQartel's Atlanta-based street team, the Rhyme Scene Unit, McCall also became a successful event planner, most notably producing a celebrity benefit for actor/activist [[Danny Glover]] at [[Fairmont San Francisco|The Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco]] in January 1993.

==Death and aftermath==
On June 25, 1997, Louis McCall was found murdered outside a friend's home in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]], the apparent victim of a home-invasion robbery.&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; His wife, Linda Lou, fought to keep the case active for eleven years, even asking the Governor of Georgia to assist in reopening the case in 2003. Finally, a suspect was indicted in 2007 in connection with the murder, but it took another year before the case made it to trial on July 21, 2008, with 29-year-old Marques Clair as defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simpson |first=David |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/07/21/mccall.html?cxntlid=inform_sr/ |title=Trial starts today in musician's '97 death |date=July 21, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525001311/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/07/21/mccall.html?cxntlid=inform_sr%2F |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clair was originally arrested with another suspect in McCall's slaying in 1999, but prosecutors had dropped the charge due to the District Attorney's refusal to bring the case before a jury with insufficient evidence.

Just two days after the start of Clair's murder trial, the proceedings were halted by Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams. A spokeswoman for the DeKalb County Georgia district attorney's office, Jada Hudspeth, stated that the suspension of the trial was "based on an omission" of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simpson |first=David |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2008/07/24/slain_musician_mistrial.html |title=Mistrial declared in case of slain musician |date=July 24, 2008 |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604101702/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2008/07/24/slain_musician_mistrial.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudspeth said that District Attorney, Gwen Keyes Fleming, and her staff would evaluate the evidence in the case before deciding whether to retry Clair. On August 7, 2008, after a mistrial was declared, the charges against Clair were formally [[dismissal with prejudice|dismissed with prejudice]].

==Legacy==
In recognition of the fact that Louis McCall was born in Alameda, CA, his name was chosen by the Alameda City Planning Board in April 2014 for naming one of the streets in the proposed residential community, Alameda Landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boitano |first=Dave |url=http://thealamedan.org/news/navy-loses-battle-over-street-names |title=Navy loses battle over street names |publisher=The Alamedan |date=April 29, 2014 |access-date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2014, Louis McCall and the other six members of Con Funk Shun were honored by the National R&amp;B Music Society with a Lifetime Achievement Award at a black tie dinner and award ceremony in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnbmusicsociety.com/#!4th-black-tie-gala-award-cerem/c10cc The National R&amp;B Music Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823055009/http://www.rnbmusicsociety.com/#!4th-black-tie-gala-award-cerem/c10cc |date=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same event, McCall's wife Linda Lou was presented with the "Unsung Heroine" award for her key role in the success of Con Funk Shun and her continued role in keeping the group's legacy alive, in addition to her tireless contribution to R&amp;B music for over four decades.&lt;ref name=LindaLou/&gt;

As well as being the band's leader, responsible for booking many of their most lucrative tours, Louis (along with Linda Lou) wrote several songs for Con Funk Shun, including "California 1", "Bad Lady", and "Honey Wild" (co-written with Con Funk Shun member Danny Thomas). In 2007, "Honey Wild", from the 1980 ''Spirit of Love'' album, was sampled by [[Lil Wayne]] for his Grammy Award-winning CD ''[[Tha Carter III]]''.

==Personal life==
In 1968, at the age of sixteen, McCall was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Vallejo, California.&lt;ref name="unsung"&gt;"Con Funk Shun."  ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]''. Exec. Prod. Frank Sinton, Arthur Smith, and Kent Weed. Co-Exec. Prod. Mark Rowland. Nar. Gary Anthony Williams. TV One, 9. Jul. 2012. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; He experienced medical problems in his adult life as a result of the accident.

Louis met his wife, the former Linda Lou Bolden from Washington, DC, in 1973, when both were working at Stax Records. The couple married on January 15, 1976, in a civil ceremony in [[San Francisco]], California. They had two children, Lindsay Chérie (born in 1979) and Louis Anthony II (born in 1982). McCall and his wife separated not long before his death,&lt;ref name="unsung"/&gt; but the pair remained close both personally and professionally.

McCall's first grandchild, Liam Richard Long, was born on March 2, 2014, to his daughter Lindsay, a [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] police officer, and her husband in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].

{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called? (Cannettes)|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

'''Pete Lawrence''' is a conceptualist, social entrepreneur, recording artist, DJ, event organiser, music programmer writer and broadcaster based in the UK.

==Background==

Lawrence created the concept for [[The Big Chill (music festival)|The Big Chill]] in February 1994, originally as a new type of Sunday multimedia club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.petelawrence.net/the_big_chill|title=The Big Chill|newspaper=Pete Lawrence|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his partner at the time, Katrina Larkin, he put together an event at which people were able to network and enjoy an experimental, audio-visual environment, as part of a multi-faceted eight-hour event. It was the first London club to have its own website and to offer free internet access and was initially noted for its ambient and downtempo soundtrack, contributing to the development of the chill out’ boom at the turn of the Millennium.

This “festival in a club” concept adapted relatively easily to an outdoors setting and in 1995 Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin staged the first Big Chill Festival, reaching a capacity of 35,000 by 2007 as one of the top UK festivals. He was also instrumental in taking The Big Chill concept to several locations worldwide in collaboration with The [[British Council]].

Lawrence was also involved in The Big Chill's expansion into opening London venues. The Big Chill Bar in Brick Lane, was followed in autumn 2006 with the three story Big Chill House in Kings Cross as well as releasing his own recording project [[Chilled By Nature]]. It included a number of EPs, one-off tracks and collaborations, live performances at The Big Chill festival, and the debut album ''Under One Sun''.

In the mid 80s, he established the [[Cooking Vinyl]] label and recorded 'The Texas Campfire Tapes' with singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked which went to No 1 in the UK Independent album charts. He co-edited the book ''Crossfade - a Big Chill Anthology'' (Serpents Tail). In December 2007, Pete Lawrence and Katrina Larkin were voted into Time Out's Top 100 ‘movers and shakers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/Pete-Lawrence|title=Pete Lawrence - Virtual Festivals|last=Jasinski|first=Mr|newspaper=Virtual Festivals|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence stood down as a director and shareholder of Chillfest (The Big Chill) in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/09/pete-lawrence-big-chill|title=My greatest mistake: Pete Lawrence|last=Snowdon|first=Graham|date=2010-10-08|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Lawrence's new project [https://campfireconvention.uk Campfire Convention] launched as a social network and membership based events community. Campfire's aims include :
Building a social movement around values, bringing people together to find common ground, real life meet ups, connections and conversations : campaigning, initiatives and engagement at local level via Campfire Beacons, building resources for reference and activism, pioneering a new journalistic media voice, creating new models for a post-capitalist world which reward engagement and global cultural exchange.

Campfire's first outdoor Convention was in August 2016 in Michaelchurch Escley, Herefordshire which included keynote addresses from their patron Brian Eno and peace activist Scilla Elworthy as well as panels, thinkshops, music, art and yoga.

The '''Rio Nuñez incident''' or '''Rio Nuñez affair''' was an [[international incident]] which occurred on the [[Nunez river|Rio Nuñez]] near [[Boké]], in modern-day [[Guinea]], in 1849. The incident occurred when vessels of a joint [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[French Second Empire|French]] naval force fired on two [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] traders in the area. 

During the 1840s and 50s, [[West Africa]] was the site of fledgling colonial rivalry between European powers. The Nuñez region lay between the [[French conquest of Senegal|French colony of Senegal]] and [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. French traders were increasingly challenged by commercial trading expeditions from Britain, Belgium and America.

The French regional commander, [[Louis Édouard Bouët-Willaumez|Édouard Bouët-Willaumez]], hoped that the Nuñez region could be formally annexed as a protectorate of the [[French colonial empire]]. The attack, far from securing the region for France, went contrary to Bouët-Willaumez's plans. Both France and Belgium led a [[cover-up]]. Attempts by the British Prime Minister, [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]], to force France to pay reparations for the incident were ultimately unsuccessful and the affair lasted four years.

The incident formed part of the "Prelude to the [[Scramble for Africa]]" and, as Bouët-Willaumez had hoped, did lead to increased French control of the Nuñez. In 1866, French forces occupied Boké. The affair was therefore one of the first signs of future French hegemony in West Africa in what would become [[French West Africa]] (AOF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5777">'''Bruce Robert Isabell''' (June 2, 1952 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[Event planning|event planner]] who was behind lavish and innovative events including weddings and funerals of the richest and most famous. He helped make Christmas at the [[White House]] during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]] and helped create innovative events that made [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]] into the place to be in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Isabell was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], where he worked in a flower shop as a youth. After graduating from high school he moved to [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/nyregion/11isabell.html "Robert Isabell, Who Turned Events Into Wondrous Occasions, Dies at 57"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 2009. Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1970s and was hired by [[Ian Schrager]] at [[Studio 54]], after Schrager had seen the creative designs Isabell had developed while he was working for event planner Renny Reynolds who had done work at the club and was the leading planner in his day. Schrager described how Isabell "never tried to do too much, it was never design on steroids, yet there was always the razzle-dazzle".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He started on his own operating a floral shop within [[Bergdorf Goodman]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. He established "a full-service event-production house" in the city's [[West Village]] where he would oversee the creation of events around the world, in which the entire setting including flowers, lighting, sound and table decorations would be part of his craft. [[Anna Wintour]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine described him as "the king of the event world" who was "a magician"&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; and the first person that top hostesses would approach to create spectacular events. Isabell created roughly 30 events for writer and editor [[Tina Brown]]. She regarded him as "sort of a genius" who had the ability to "take any space and make magic in it".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For over a decade, he designed the annual [[Met Ball]] for ''Vogue''.&lt;ref name=TCBG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/shopping/fashion/features/11894/|title=The Charity Ball Game|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=2005-05-21|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, he had four tons of [[glitter]] dumped on the floor of [[Studio 54]] for a New Year's Eve event, with club co-owner Ian Schrager describing how guests felt "like you were standing on stardust".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Bracketed between the 1986 wedding of [[Edwin Schlossberg]] to [[Caroline Kennedy]] and the 1996 nuptials of [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]] and [[Carolyn Bessette]], he worked on the 1994 funeral of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; For the July 1995 wedding of billionaire [[Robert Warren Miller]]'s daughter [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] to [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]] at [[Saint Sophia (London)|Saint Sophia]] in [[Bayswater]], [[London]], Isabell created a virtual Greek temple in a tent, including pillars topped with roses, with a budget variously estimated at $5–8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Bob.

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For the wedding of [[Alexandra von Fürstenberg]], Marie-Chantal's sister, to Prince Alexandre Egon von Fürstenberg, son of [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], Isabell transformed a tent in [[Battery Park]] into a Chinese teahouse complete with a throne room that included hanging lanterns and bamboo trees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzy Menkes|Menkes, Suzy]].

Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For Christmas 1998 at the Clinton White House, Isabell created a massive fir wreath with 1,500 lights individually colored a shade he called "Presidential blue".&lt;ref&gt;Bumiller, Elizabeth. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/22/nyregion/a-star-floral-designer-s-flights-of-fancy.html "A Star Floral Designer's Flights of Fancy"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 22, 1998. Accessed July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His last project was an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] event he co-prepared for [[Lally Weymouth]] in [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]].&lt;ref name=WWDObit&gt;Feitelberg, Rosemary. [http://www.wwd.com/lifestyle-news/robert-isabell-a-list-party-planner-dies-2209256?gnewsid=bd9eca87a8f58bd9363f4db087fd936b "Robert Isabell, A-List Party Planner, Dies"], ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', July 10, 2009. Accessed July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Schrager]] stated that Isabell had headed home from [[The Hamptons]] on the night of July 4 and had not been heard from before his death.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

A resident of [[Manhattan]]'s [[Greenwich Village]], Isabell was found dead on July 8, 2009, aged 57, in his townhouse at 16 Minetta Lane, where he had suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack). He is survived by his mother, two brothers and a sister.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

It is celebrated in a grand way by the [[Thevar]] community in the southern districts of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/28tn1.htm |title=Security beefed up in Madurai for Thevar Jayanthi |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an official public holiday, many schools and businesses in the area remain closed on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/31/stories/2006103105270300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/31/stories/2005103116560300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions pass off peacefully |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/31/stories/2007103159910300.htm |title=Thevar jayanthi processions peaceful |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thevar's legacy==
Whilst having been active in politics, it is mainly the spiritual discourse of Thevar that explains his following after his death. Also, the fact that his date of birth and death lie some close to each other has been interpreted as a sign of supernatural powers.&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

==Thevar Samadhi==
One of the main events on Thevar Jayanthi takes place at the ''samadhi'' (burial place) of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar, located at some 50 miles distance from [[Madurai]]. Pilgrims gather to take part in the ceremonies at the ''samadhi'' on 30 October. In later years the ceremony at the ''samadhi'' has begun to attract prominent politicians.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Robinson, Rowena. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cIOqGcvHqoC&amp;pg=PA167 Sociology of Religion in India]''. New Delhi [u.a.]: SAGE, 2004. pp. 165-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversy==
The [[All India Forward Bloc]], the [[political party]] to which Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar belonged, has demanded that Thevar Jayanthi be declared a public holiday in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=710090655&amp;cat=&amp;n_date=20071009 |title=Mid term polls linked to Cong stand on US nuke pact: AIFB|publisher=webindia123.com |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is not entirely uncontroversial. The [[CPI(ML) Liberation]] has charged that the Tamil Nadu government should stop sponsoring Thevar Jayanthi celebrations, claiming that the event is utilised by [[caste]]ist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpiml.org/liberation/year_2009/jan_09/reports.html |title=Kerala : Land Reforms Undone |publisher=[[Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation]]|date= |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 centenary celebrations==
On 30 October 2007, the birth centenary of Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar was celebrated. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[M. Karunanidhi]] took part in the celebrations in [[Pasumpon]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/10/30/karunanidhi-jaya-pay-floral-tributes-to-muthuramalinga-thevar-1193737346.html |title=Karunanidhi, Jaya pay floral tributes to Muthuramalinga Thevar|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]|date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in two decades that Karunanidhi participated in Thevar Jayanthi.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; At the celebrations, Karunanidhi suggested that [[Madurai Airport]] be renamed after Pasumpon Muthuramalingam Thevar. These moves were seen as an attempt by Karunanidhi's [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) party to challenge the supremacy of the rival [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) over the Thevar community. The AIADMK leader [[J. Jayalalitha]] criticised Karunanidhi's participation in the Thevar Jayanthi centenary programme, stating that he did not believe in Thevar's ideas. Moreover, she claimed that her previous government had allocated 30&amp;nbsp;million [[Indian rupee|rupees]] for the Thevar Jayanthi centenary, but that Karunanidhi's government had spent only five million rupees.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianchristians.in/news/content/view/1732/48/ |title=New Icon, Old Wounds |publisher=All India Christian Council|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the geographical place see [[Tonto Basin]]

'''''Tonto Basin''''' is a western novel written by [[Zane Grey]].

==Origin==
''Tonto Basin'' is the original version of the shorter novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To The Last Man]]'' (1921). Grey submitted the manuscript of ''Tonto Basin'' to the magazine ''The Country Gentleman,'' which published it in serialization as ''To the Last Man'' from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the  original leaving out much of the [[backstory]] and [[Characterisation|character development]]. This shorter version was published as a [[book]] by [[Harper Brothers]] in 1921.

==Plot introduction==
A story of a feud between two families, the evil it causes, and the power of love to transcend all.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with 24-year-old Jean Isbel in the last stages of a multi-week trip from Oregon to the frontier in Arizona where his family had moved four years earlier to start a cattle ranch. As he nears his destination he meets a woman in the woods, and falls in love at first sight. As they part they learn that they are mortal enemies. She is Ellen Jorth, and her family is locked in a deadly feud with his.

Jean dreads the part his father, Gaston, wants him to play in the feud. He can’t get Ellen out of his mind. They meet again and his words awake in her doubt and fear that her father, Lee Jorth, is not an honorable man but in fact a horse thief and cattle rustler. As events unfold her fears are proved true. Through thick and thin Jean Isbel defends Ellen’s honor and believes the best of her.

The feud erupts into fatal gun battles, first at the Isbel ranch house, and then at the general store in the nearby town. Most of the Isbel and Jorth clans are killed, with several of their allies. The remnant of the Jorths flee with Ellen in tow to a hide-out hidden in a deep box cañon.

Jean and his allies track them and there is a deadly gun battle in the woods nearby. Ellen is forced by one of the three remaining Jorth allies to flee once again. During their flight their horse is shot out from under them. Ellen now on foot meets one of the dying Isbels and finally learns the certain truth that her father, family, and their allies were horse thieves and cattle rustlers as she feared.

When she finally makes her way back to the hide-out, she arrives just after Jean has been forced to take refuge in the loft, unknown to her. One of the two remaining rustlers attacks her with rape in mind but is interrupted by the arrival of the other rustler. Ellen discovers Jean during this interruption. When the rustler returns a few minutes later, Ellen is forced to kill him to protect herself and Jean. A minute later Jean kills the last rustler.

The story ends with Jean and Ellen declaring their love for each other.

==Themes==
The book is concerned with the destruction deadly violence wreaks on those family members who survive. Grey writes about the intense concern Jean feels for the impact the violence will have on the wives and children whose husbands and fathers will die in the feud.

The feud is caused by a love triangle between Gaston Isbel, Lee Jorth, and Ellen the woman both love, and the mother of Ellen Jorth. The story explores how love, betrayal, and jealousy can engender a hate which leads two men to destroy their families, without a thought to the pain and suffering of those relatives who will be left to bury the dead.

Ellen grows from a naïve girl to a woman of understanding under the severe trial of the events which overtake her. She begins to examine critically her own behavior with wisdom and insight. She grows and matures emotionally and psychologically, becoming aware that her father whom she had supported with unquestioning trust, is in fact a scoundrel, a thief, and a thoroughly dishonorable rogue. At the end she acts decisively and fatally to protect herself, her virtue, and the man she loves.

==Publication==
In the early 1990s, [[Jon Tuska]], was researching the [[filmography]] of Zane Grey. During this research he discovered that ''[[Last of the Duanes (novel)|Last of the Duanes]]'' and ''[[Rangers of the Lone Star]]'' were much altered from the [[holograph]] found "in the bottom drawer of a file cabinet in the Zane Grey, Inc. room where it had survived for eighty years.".&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 8. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused him to request that they "tell me of any other manuscripts...that had  met a similar fate."&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Zane: "Tonto Basin", (quote from the ''Foreword'' by Jon Tuska) page 9. Five Star, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59414-050-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was the discovery of the complete holographic [[manuscript]] of the novel ''[[To the Last Man (Zane Grey)|To the Last Man]]''. A comparison of the holograph with ''To the Last Man'' revealed that the holograph was much longer, and contained detail which altered the meaning of the story. The complete uncut version was published in 2004.

The term '''use error''' has recently been introduced to replace the commonly used terms '''[[human error]]''' and '''[[user error]]'''. The new term, which has already been adopted by [[international standard]]s organizations for [[medical device]]s (see [[#Use errors in health care]] below for references), suggests that [[accident]]s should be attributed to the circumstances, rather than to the human beings who happened to be there.

==The need for the terminological change==
The term "use error" was first used in May 1995 in an [[MD+DI]] guest editorial,  [http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error “The Issue Is ‘Use,’ Not ‘User,’ Error,”] by [http://biomed.tamu.edu/people/faculty.php?lname=Hyman William Hyman].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mddionline.com/article/issue-use-not-user-error&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, human errors are considered as a special aspect of [[human factors]]. Accordingly, they are attributed to the human [[Computer operator|operator]], or [[user (computing)|user]].
When taking this approach, we assume that the system design is perfect, and the only source for the use errors is the human operator. For example, the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[HFACS]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://uscg.mil/careercentral/cg113/docs/ergo_hfacs/hfacs.pdf], Department of Defense Human Factors Analysis and Classification System: A mishap investigation and data analysis tool&lt;/ref&gt; 
classifies use errors attributed to the human operator, disregarding improper design and configuration setting, which often result in missing [[alarms]], or in inappropriate [[alert messaging|alerting]].

The need for changing the term was due to a common [[malpractice]] of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s (the responsible organizations, the authorities, journalists) in cases of accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lu.se/upload/Trafikflyghogskolan/TR2002-01_ReInventionofHumanError.pdf], Dekker: Reinvention of Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of investing in fixing the error-prone design, management attributed the error to the users.
The need for the change has been pointed out by the accident investigators: 
* Early in 1983, Erik Hollnagel&lt;ref&gt;
[https://sites.google.com/site/erikhollnagel2/], Erik Hollnagel home page
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the term Human Error refers to the outcome, not to the cause. A user action is typically classified as an error only if the results are painful &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ida.liu.se/~eriho/Bellagio_M.htm], Hollnagel: Why "Human Error" is a Meaningless Concept&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the story “Leap of Faith” of his book “Set Phasers on Stun”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegeanpublishing.com/phaser1.html], Steve Casey: Set Phasers on Stun&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Casey suggested that the accident of the [[Indian Airlines Flight 605]] near Bangalor in 1990 could have been avoided, should the investigators of the [[Air France Flight 296]] accident of 1988 past the Mulhouse-Habsheim airport considered the circumstances (exceptional situation), rather than the pilots (human errors).
* In his book “Managing the Risks of Organizational Accidents” ([[Organizational models of accidents]]) James Reason explained and demonstrated that often, the circumstances for accidents could have been controlled by the responsible organization, and not by the operators. 
* In his book “The Field Guide to Understanding Human Errors”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260],  Sidney Dekker:  The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Dekker argued that blaming the operators according to “The Old View” results in defensive behavior of operators, which hampers the efforts to learn from near-misses and from accidents.

==Use errors vs. force majeure==
A mishap is typically considered as either a use error or a force majeure:
&lt;ref name="Weiler"&gt;[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/ITS-Alarms-Apr2011.pdf], Weiler and Harel: Managing the Risks of Use Errors: The ITS Warning Systems Case Study&lt;/ref&gt;
* A use error is a mishap in which a human operator is involved. Typically, such mishaps are attributed to the failure of the human operator &lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9780754648260], Dekker, 2007: The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A force majeure is a mishap that does not involve a human being in the chain of events preceding the event.

==Use errors in health care==
In 1998, Cook, Woods and Miller presented the concept of [[hindsight bias]], exemplified by celebrated accidents in medicine, by a workgroup on patient safety
.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ctlab.org/documents/A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Stories.pdf], Cook RI, Woods DD, Miller C [1998] A Tale of Two Stories: Contrasting Views of Patient Safety
&lt;/ref&gt;
The workgroup pointed at the tendency to attribute accidents in health care to isolated human failures.
They provide references to early research about the effect of knowledge of the outcome, which was unavailable beforehand, on later judgement about the processes that led up to that outcome. They explain that in looking back, we tend to oversimplify the situation that the actual practitioners faces. They conclude focusing on the hindsight knowledge prevents our understanding of the richer story, the circumstances of the human error.

According to this position, the term Use Error is formally defined in several [[international standard]]s, such as [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 62366, [[ISO 14155]] and [[ISO 14971]], to describe
: ''an act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device response than intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user.''

[[ISO standards]] about medical devices and procedures provide examples of use errors, which are attributed to human factors, include slips, [[lapses]] and mistakes. Practically, this means that they are attributed to the user, implying the user’s accountability.
The  U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] glossary of medical devices provides the following explanation about this term:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/InfusionPumps/ucm202502.htm], FDA, Medical Devices, Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Safe and effective use of a medical device means that users do not make errors that lead to injury and they achieve the desired medical treatment. If safe and effective use is not achieved, use error has occurred. Why and how use error occurs is a [[human factors]] concern."

With this interpretation by ISO and the FDA, the term ‘use error’ is actually synonymous with ‘user error’.
Another approach, which distinguishes ‘use errors’ from ‘user errors', is taken by IEC 62366. Annex A includes an explanation justifying the new term:
:"This International Standard uses the concept of use error. This term was chosen over the more commonly used term of “human error” because not all errors associated with the use of medical device are the result of oversight or carelessness of the part of the user of the medical device. Much more commonly, use errors are the direct result of poor user interface design."

This explanation complies with “The New View”, which Sidney Dekker suggested as an alternative to “The Old View”. This interpretation favors investigations intended to understand the situation, rather than blaming the operators.

In a 2011 report draft on health IT usability, the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) defines "use error" in healthcare IT this way: “Use error is a term used very specifically to refer to user interface designs that will engender users to make errors of commission or omission. It is true that users do make errors, but many errors are due not to user error per se but due to designs that are flawed, e.g., poorly written messaging, misuse of color-coding conventions, omission of information, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;''NISTIR 7804: Technical Evaluation, Testing and Validation of the Usability of Electronic Health Records, Draft, Sept. 2011, pg. 10. '' [https://www.nist.gov/healthcare/usability/upload/Draft_EUP_09_28_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Example of user error ===
An example of an accident due to a user error is the ecological disaster of 1967 caused by the [[Torrey Canyon]] supertanker. The accident was due to a combination of several exceptional events, the result of which was that the supertanker was heading directly to the rocks. At that point, the captain failed to change the course because the steering control lever was inadvertently set to the Control position, which disconnected the rudder from the wheel at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Casey, A memento of your service, in Set Phasers on Stun, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of user failure to handle system failure===
Examples of the second type are the [[Three Mile Island accident]] described above, the [[New York City blackout of 1977|NYC blackout]] following a storm and the chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India ([[Bhopal Disaster]]).

==Classifying use errors==
The URM Model &lt;ref name="Task-oriented"&gt;
[http://avi.har-el.com/eng/Articles/Task-Oriented-SE.pdf], Zonnenshain &amp; Harel: Task-oriented SE, INCOSE 2009 Conference, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes use errors in terms of the user’s failure to manage a system deficiency. Six categories of use errors are described in a URM document:
#Expected faults with risky results;
#Expected faults with unexpected results;
#Expected user errors in identifying risky situations (this study);
#User Errors in handling expected faults;
#Expected errors in function selection;
#Unexpected faults, due to operating in exceptional states.

==Critics==
Erik Hollnagel argues that going from and 'old' view to a 'new' view is not enough. One should go all the way to a 'no' view. This means that the notion of error, whether user error or use error might be destructive rather than constructive. 
Instead, he proposes to focus on the performance variability of everyday actions, on the basis that this performance variability is both useful and necessary. In most cases the result is that things go right, in a few cases that things go wrong. But the reason is the same.

'''Year zero''' does not exist in the [[anno Domini]] system usually used to number years in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and in its predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]. In this system, the year {{nowrap|[[1 BC]]}} is followed by {{nowrap|[[AD 1]]}}.  However, there is a year zero in [[astronomical year numbering]] (where it coincides with the Julian year {{nowrap|1 BC}})  and in [[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (where it coincides with the Gregorian year {{nowrap|1 BC}}) as well as in all [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu calendar]]s.

The ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era was introduced in 525 by [[Scythia Minor|Scythian]] monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (c. 470–c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. He introduced the new era to avoid using the ''[[Diocletian Era|Diocletian era]]'', based on the accession of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]], as he did not wish to continue the memory of [[Diocletianic Persecution|a persecutor of Christians]]. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the "present year" was "the [[consulship]] of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]] [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]" which was also 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Dionysius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|title=DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS. LIBER DE PASCHATE SIVE CYCLUS PASCHALIS|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109025617/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; How he arrived at that number is unknown.

Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric [[Bede]] (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English [[Anno Domini|before Christ]] once, but that practice did not catch on until very much later. Bede did not sequentially number [[Roman calendar#Months|days of the month]], weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the [[week#numerical|days of the week]] using a counting origin of one in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. Previous Christian histories used ''[[anno mundi]]'' ("in the year of the world") beginning on the first day of [[Creation myth|creation]], or ''anno Adami'' ("in the year of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the [[Genesis creation narrative]]), used by Africanus, or ''anno Abrahami'' ("in the year of [[Abraham]]") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the [[Septuagint]], used by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], all of which assigned "one" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.

In chapter II of book I of ''Ecclesiastical history'', Bede stated that [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Britain "in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord", while stating in chapter III, "in the year of Rome 798, [[Claudius]]" also invaded Britain and "within a very few days … concluded the war in … the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html|title=Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term "before Christ" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, ''not'' a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' ("before the time of the lord's incarnation"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Neither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of [[Roman numerals]]. The [[Babylonian numerals#Numerals|Babylonian system]] of the BC era had used the idea of "nothingness" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use [[Latin]] number words, or the word ''nulla'' (meaning "nothing") alongside Roman numerals.&lt;ref name=Dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans. ''Bede: The Reckoning of Time'' (725), Liverpool: Liverpool Univ. Pr., 2004. {{ISBN|0-85323-693-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Byrhtferth's Enchiridion'' (1016). Edited by Peter S. Baker and Michael Lapidge. Early English Text Society 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-19-722416-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zero was invented in India in the sixth century, and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century. The [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero ([[0 (number)|0]]) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.

The ''anno Domini'' nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the {{nowrap|1 January}} to {{nowrap|31 December}} historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in ''Fasciculus Temporum'' by [[Werner Rolevinck]] in 1474, alongside years of the world (''anno mundi'').&lt;ref&gt;Werner Rolevinck, ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''anno Domini'', ''Dionysian era'', ''Christian era'', ''vulgar era'', and ''common era'' were used interchangeably between the [[Renaissance]] and the 19th century, at least in [[Latin]]. But ''vulgar era'' was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after ''vulgar'' acquired the meaning of "offensively coarse", replacing its original meaning of "common" or "ordinary". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.

Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|500 BC}} and {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|AD 500}}, there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage ''anno Domini'' 1 is preceded by the year 1 [[Ante Christum Natum|BC]], without an intervening year zero.&lt;ref&gt;While it is increasingly common to place ''AD'' after a date by analogy to the use of ''BC'', formal English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year as in Latin (e.g., {{nowrap|100 BC}}, but {{nowrap|AD 100}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the choice of calendar system (whether [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) nor the era (''Anno Domini'' or [[Common Era]]) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (1958), page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomers ===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}

In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is &amp;minus;1, and so on.

The letters "AD", "BC", "CE, or "BCE" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to &amp;minus;1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Univ Science Books| isbn = 1-891389-85-8| editor1-first = Sean E. | editor1-last= Urban | editor2-first = P.

==== History of astronomical usage ====
In 1627, the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. He labeled the year ''Christi'' and inserted it between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (BC) and ''Post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae – Ioannes Keplerus] (1627) 191 (42), 197 (48), 203 (54), 209 (60), 215 (66), 221 (72), 227 (78).&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1702 the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae – Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (AD).&lt;ref&gt;[Jacques] Cassini, ''Tables astronomiques'' (1740), Explication et usage 5; Tables 10, 22, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISO 8601 ===

[[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. Because it also specifies the use of the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era. The "basic" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Several "expanded" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an [[absolute value]] one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only [[ISO 646]] (7-bit [[ASCII]]) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a [[hyphen-minus]].

== Other traditions ==

=== South Asian calendars ===
All eras used with [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist calendar]]s, such as the [[Saka era]] or the [[Kali Yuga]], begin with the year 0. All  these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a [[24-hour clock]]: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, ''n'' minutes.

A '''Zero Waste Event''' (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as [[paper cup]]s, food scraps, and plastic [[water bottle]]s that are generated by the event.  ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/conference/ |title=Future of Business Conference- Sustainable Strategies for 2013 — Sustainable Connections |publisher=Sconnect.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/tzw/TZW08_insert_v4.pdf/ |format=PDF |title=Think Local - Buy Local : Be waste Free |publisher=Sconnect.org|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabletransforum.ca/presentations.html] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/jill-donello-zero-in-on-zero-waste/ |title=Jill Donello – Zero In on Zero Waste &amp;#124; |publisher=Theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of [[Zero waste|Zero Waste]] Events is spreading.  Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations. Increasingly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322144442/http://zerowasteevents.org/protocol/ Zero Waste Events] are sharing best practices and developing new ways to divert event materials from landfills.

==Strategy==
ZeeWee's utilize many if not all of the following strategies.

'''Front-end waste prevention'''
* Eliminating race packets in favor of emailed sponsor coupons for participants;
* Eliminating commercial [[bottled water]] distribution in favor of bulk water stations and compostable cups;
* Purchasing recycled content products, from event [[t-shirt]]s to paper products; and
* Providing discounted entries or incentives for participants who travel to the event using alternative transportation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153628/http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp |date=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse of event equipment'''
* Reusable, weatherproof banners and stands;
* Adaptable date panels on banners and signs so they can be reused year after year; and
* Use of durable dishware "lending libraries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925211512/http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of always buying disposables.

'''Recycling event materials'''
* Many items from unsoiled paper, cardboard, glass, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, aluminum cans and plastic tarps to corrugated polypropylene signs can be recycled depending on the services available in a given municipality or county.  In many cases, such services are less costly than disposal of the same items;
* Having a dedicated Recycling Team onsite throughout the event to supervise recycling stations and sort materials to maximize landfill diversion and minimize contamination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dunn |url=http://runningmagazine.ca/sections/news/vancouver-half-recycles-95-of-waste/ |title=Vancouver half-marathon produces only four bags of garbage - Canadian Running Magazine |publisher=Runningmagazine.ca |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Where programs require subsidy, ZeeWee organizers may use a "green fee" to help move the event toward sustainability by paying for [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]], buying recycled products, or more recently purchasing carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norkarecreation.com/hcrewards.htm |title=Bellingham/Whatcom County Washington |publisher=NorKarecreation.com |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Olympics==
When the bid was submitted for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], [[LOCOG]], The London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, pledged not just to host the biggest sporting event in the world but also to stage the first truly sustainable Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13160540 |title=London 2012 Olympics team publishes first green report - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this was an ambitious target to send zero waste from Games-time venues directly to landfill &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/locog-publications/london-2012-sustainability-plan.pdf |title=Official Reports, Studies, Publications &amp;#124; Downloads &amp;#124; Olympic.org |publisher=London2012.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – something that no Games has attempted before. 
In February 2012 an initiative was launched to share the lessons learnt from delivering a zero waste games with the wider waste and events community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerowasteevents.org/front/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327035411/http://zerowasteevents.org/front/ |date=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
