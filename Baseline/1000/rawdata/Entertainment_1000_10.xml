{{distinguish|Art director}}
An '''artistic director''' is the executive of an arts organization, particularly in a theatre or dance company, who handles the organization's artistic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Actor Prepares|last = Stanislavski|first = Constantin|publisher = Theatre Arts Inc. New York|year = 1936|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meyerhold the Director|last = Rudnitsky|first = Konstantin, Transl. G. Petrov|publisher = Ardis, Ann Arbor, MI|year = 1981|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Empty Space|last = Brook|first = Peter|publisher = Harmondsworth, UK: Pelican|year = 1972|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally a [[Theatrical producer|producer]] and [[Theatre director|director]], but not in the sense of a [[Business magnate|mogul]], since the organization is generally a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] organization. The artistic director of a [[Theatre|theatre company]] is the individual with the overarching artistic control of the theatre's production choices, directorial choices, and overall artistic vision.  In smaller theatres, the artistic director may be the founder of the theatre and the primary director of its plays.  In larger non-profit theatres (often known in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] as [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatres]]), the artistic director may be appointed by the [[board of directors]].

==Overview==
The artistic director of a performing arts company is similar to the [[Music director|musical director]] of an orchestra, the primary person responsible for planning a company's season. The artistic director's responsibilities can include (but are not limited to) choosing the [[Play (theatre)|material]] staged in a season, the hiring of creative/production personnel (such as [[theatre director|directors]]), and other theatre management tasks. He or she may also [[Theatre director|direct]] productions for the company. Artistic directors work closely with the general manager of the theatre, and contribute the artistic evaluation of projects and productions to be included in promotional, funding, and press materials. An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors who are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support, counsel, and/or artistic input where requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication in Theatre Directing and Performance from rehearsal to production|last = Lanipekun|first = Jennifer|publisher = Cambria Press, New York|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = Appendix I: Interview with Director 1, Artistic Director of Opera Company 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic director is usually prepared to assume the production should the director become unable to complete his/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic representatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their theatre to the press.  In the United States, artistic directors often have [[fundraising]] responsibilities as well. 

In some ensemble companies, the artistic director is responsible for recruiting performers to act as a talent pool for the company's productions.  This ensemble may include actors and artists of various disciplines. The artistic director functions as leader of this group, with the aim to create and/or realize various new and established works. 

In [[ballet]], the artistic director is the head of a [[ballet company]]. They have overall responsibility for training the dancers as well as selecting and mounting productions. They are almost always a retired dancer. Often they also [[Choreography|choreograph]] some of the company's productions. 

In some companies, the artistic director may also manage the day-to-day operations of the company, but in many (particularly larger) companies, the artistic director is often exempt from routine administrative duties, freeing him or her to concentrate on the art.  In those cases, decisions about administration, business issues, finances, fundraising, board relations, donor relations, publicity, and marketing devolve to the responsibility of the general manager, chief operating officer, managing director, etc. or are discussed collaboratively.

'''''Attack of the Killer Tomatoes''''' is a 1978 [[Musical film|musical]] [[dark comedy]] [[horror film]] produced by J. [[Stephen  Peace]] and John DeBello, and directed by John DeBello based upon an original idea by [[Costa Dillon]]. The screenplay was written by Dillon, Peace, and  DeBello. The film is a spoof of [[B movie]]s. Made on a budget less than [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000, the story involves [[tomato]]es becoming sentient by unknown means and revolting against humanity.    

The success of the film led to three sequels, all co-written by the same three writers and directed by DeBello.

==Plot==
The film opens with a scroll saying that when [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a precredits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's [[garbage disposal]]. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance with which she is covered is not blood, but tomato juice.

A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occurs (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'').  While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that no credible threat exists, the President puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes, led by a man named [[Mason–Dixon line|Mason Dixon]]. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]; scuba diver Greg Colburn; [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.

Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could "pass the ketchup." Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the President sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency Mind Makers, where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys, including a bumper sticker with "STP" for "Stop Tomato Program" on it, a satirical reference to both the real "[[whip inflation now]]" campaign with its widely ridiculed "WIN" slogan and [[STP_(motor_oil_company)|STP motor oil]] decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s. A human is revealed to be also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him, but misses. A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor, who sends Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him.

Gretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the West Coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon, but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died, and he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin in a "slow car chase" that has since been copied by other comedies. Dixon is eventually knocked out by his own car. Awakening, Dixon finds himself captured by Richardson. Though he did not create the killer tomatoes, he has discovered how to control them and plans to do so once civilization has collapsed - leaving him in control. He is about to reveal his secret of control to Dixon when Finletter charges in and runs him through with his sword. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that he has seen the  tomatoes retreat at the sound of the song "Puberty Love", but had not put two and two together until now. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium. Finletter remarks that "only crazy people" are left in the nearly deserted city, resulting in a motley assortment of people in costumes facing the attacking tomatoes at the stadium.

The tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. "Puberty Love" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs, hence cannot hear the music. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to "Puberty Love". He professes his love to her, in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the soil and says "All right, you guys. They're gone now."

The film also contains the first screen appearance of [[Dana Ashbrook]], then aged 10 or 11, as Boy on Boat (uncredited).

==Production==
The finished film contains footage of a real helicopter crash.  In a scene showing law enforcement officers firing their weapons to ward off tomatoes in a field, a $600,000 [[Hiller Aircraft]] UH-12E that had been rented for the production was supposed to have landed in the tomato patch behind the officers, but during the landing, its tail rotor struck the ground, causing the craft to spin out of control near the ground, roll over, and burst into flames.  The helicopter pilot escaped without serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Movie_Crash2.htm | title=Movie Crash from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, July 11th, 1978 | accessdate=April 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash was caught on film as the cameras were rolling at the time. The crash was later worked into the film.
&lt;!-- what? It was done saying of character Von Schauer who survived the crash saying the helicopter was attacked by a "kamikaze" tomato.
 --&gt;
==Music==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2015}}
The theme song, written by DeBello, describes the tomatoes' rampages through the world, describing that they have killed a man named Herman Farbage while he was taking out the garbage, that the mayor is on vacation to get out of stopping them, that they have scared off the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], and that they have even eaten the [[narrator]]'s sister. This theme song is used in different variations over the course of the series, here simply sounding like the score of an old monster movie with lyrics and a more catchy tune. All other music was written by [[Gordon Goodwin]] and Paul Sundfor with lyrics by Dillon, DeBello, and Peace.

The song "Puberty Love" was sung by the then-teenaged [[Matt Cameron]], who later became the drummer for [[Soundgarden]] and since 1998 has been the drummer for [[Pearl Jam]].

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The film received negative reviews and has become a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tomatoes-ripe-a-redo-106635|title='Tomatoes' ripe for a redo|last=Goldstein|first=Gregg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 11, 2008|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "isn't even worthy of sarcasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1978/film/reviews/attack-of-the-killer-tomatoes-1200424541/|title=Review: 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'|author=&lt;!-- Staff --&gt;|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|year=1978|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
A number of sequels and other spin-off material have been done in various media as a result of this movie. They include three movie sequels:

* ''[[Return of the Killer Tomatoes]]!'' (1988)
* ''[[Killer Tomatoes Strike Back]]!'' (1990)
* ''[[Killer Tomatoes Eat France]]!'' (1991)

The sequel ''Return of the Killer Tomatoes'' picks up the story 10 years later. The film is notable for the casting of [[George Clooney]] in one of his first film roles.
 
American composer and orchestrator Gordon Goodwin, one of the original composers for the film, later wrote an Emmy-nominated, big-band piece inspired by the music for this film, to be played with his jazz ensemble [[Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band]].   

===Adaptations, parodies, and spin-offs===
* The film was adapted in 1990 as ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (TV series)|Attack of the Killer Tomatoes]]'', a [[cartoon]] [[TV series]] which ran on [[Fox Kids]], but despite the name, it was based on ''Return of the Killer Tomatoes''. 
* A novel released in 1997, ''[[Attack of the Killer Potatoes]]'', pays tribute to the film.
* Different video games were developed: a [[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (1986 video game)|1986 video game]] released for [[8-bit]] computers, which was based on the film, and a [[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (1991 video game)|1991 video game]] released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Game Boy]] game consoles, which was based on the animated series.
* [[Viper Comics]] released a [[comic book]] adaptation of the film in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/news/121304381210723.htm Viper Comics Launches All Horror Imprint "Black Mamba Books"], [[Comics Bulletin]], June 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kim Harrison]]'s book series ''The Hollows'' is based in a world where genetically engineered tomatoes killed off a significant portion of the human population. The author admitted inspiration came from this movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourgaggleofgirls.com/books/2008/02/09/author-interview-kim-harrison/ |title=A Gaggle of Book Reviews &amp;#124; Author Interview: Kim Harrison |publisher=Ourgaggleofgirls.com |date=February 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comedy rock''' is rock music mixed with [[Comedy music|comedy]], often satire and parody.&lt;ref name=AllmusicComedyRock&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul'' (Backbeat Books, 3rd Edition., 2002), pp. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early bands and songs===
Early American examples include [[Stan Freberg]], who lampooned artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[The Platters]], and [[Sheb Wooley]]. The latter's "[[Purple People Eater]]" reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart in 1958 and stayed there 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Bronson  | first = Fred  | title = The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits: The Inside Story Behind Every Number  | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]  | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-8230-7677-6  | page = 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s comedians such as [[Charlie Drake]] and [[The Goons]] frequently appeared in the top ten with humorous rock 'n' roll records—the latter, along with [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]], were to influence the word-play of [[John Lennon]]'s lyrics. Later British groups specialised in comedy: these included [[The Scaffold]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and [[Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias]]. Later in Britain, in the 2000s, [[Mitch Benn]] released several studio albums that satirised current affairs using various musical genres, but mainly rock. His 2012 ''Breaking Strings'' album was critically acclaimed for its rock sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John-Paul |last=Stephenson |title=CD Review: Mitch Benn &amp; The Distractions – Breaking Strings.|url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/02/cd-review-mitch-benn-the-distractions-breaking-strings/ |work=Giggle Beats |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]] described [[Frank Zappa]] as the "godfather" of comedy rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pop rock]] and [[folk rock]] band [[The Turtles]] released a comedy rock album, ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', in 1968, though the band had previously incorporated humor into their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r20668 |tab=review |label="''The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands'' &gt; Review" |Michael |last=Ofjord |accessdate={{date|2011-09-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its members, [[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]] later performed more explicitly comedic songs as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]] with their own band and with Frank Zappa.

===Contemporary bands===
Several modern comedy rock bands have experienced mainstream commercial success. Duos [[Tenacious D]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]] both released platinum-selling albums and starred in their own respective comedic television series. [[Dan Finnerty]] with his [[The Dan Band]] has made comedy rock appearances in the [[Todd Phillips]] films ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' and ''[[The Hangover]]'' spoofing "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" and "[[Candy Shop]]", as well as his live show, which parodies female cover songs and was filmed as a one-hour TV special directed by [[McG]] and executive produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. [[Stephen Lynch (musician)|Stephen Lynch]] from New York developed a following with several Opie and Anthony appearances which led to two specials on Comedy Central. He performed on Broadway with the production of Grease.

With over 12 million albums sold, song parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] remains the highest-selling comedy act in history, with his 2014 album ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' having debuted at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the first comedy album to do so since [[Allan Sherman]]{{'}}s ''[[My Son, the Nut]]'' in 1963.&lt;ref name="billboardnews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6176745/weird-al-yankovic-billboard-200-mandatory-fun-number-one | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Gets First No. 1 Album On Billboard 200 with 'Mandatory Fun' | first = Keith | last = Caulfield | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has been the target of many [[Parody|spoof]]s and several spoof bands have gone on to have hit records, for example [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] in the U.S., and [[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]] and [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] in the UK. The band [[Steel Panther]] has become a fixture on the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Sunset Strip]] with their parody of 80s [[glam metal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feeling The Steel Panther: Interview with Michael Starr |publisher=The Aquarian Weekly |date=4 October 2009 |work=Nightlife |url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2009/10/04/interview-steel-panther-michael-starr-feeling-the-steel/ | accessdate=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success has opened the doors for other spoof bands such as [[The Jimi Homeless Experience]]. Other spoof bands such as [[Dread Zeppelin]], [[Beatallica]] and [[Those Darn Accordions]] rely on unusual or intentionally contrasting genre-mixing for comic effect. Comedy rock duo [[Ninja Sex Party]], who have collaborated with Steel Panther on occasion, blend rock and [[synthpop]] and have produced songs that parody the [[dubstep]] and heavy metal genres. They have enjoyed success from their online popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |last=Milne |first=Gregory |title=Ninja Sex Party: Tales of Strawberries and Cream |date=11 July 2013 |newspaper=Living Myth Magazine |publisher=Living Myth Magazine |accessdate=29 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525175156/http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |archivedate=25 May 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another band, [[Primus (band)|Primus]], is known for their wacky lyrics and comedic music videos.

Many bands within the [[alternative rock]] and [[college rock]] spectrum are known for their incorporation of humorous and satirical songs, with bands such as [[They Might Be Giants]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[System of a Down]], [[Ween]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]] finding both mainstream and independent success in the United States, as well as successful foreign bands such as [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and [[Knorkator]].

[[Punk rock]] and [[pop punk]] has made its contribution to the comedy rock ranks, with such bands as [[The Aquabats]], [[Blink-182]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[Patent Pending (band)|Patent Pending]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[The Dead Milkmen]], [[The Meatmen]] and [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]]. [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] has also produced many humor-oriented and satirical bands, including [[Green Jellÿ]], [[Lawnmower Deth]], [[Massacration]], [[M.O.D.]], [[Big Dumb Face]], [[Psychostick]], Crotchduster, [[Ludichrist]] and [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], while other bands like [[Gwar]] and [[Rosemary's Billygoat]] utilize outrageous costumes and over-the-top stage shows. The [[virtual band]] [[Dethklok]] is [[death metal]] spoof featured in the [[Adult Swim]] animated TV Show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p882076|pure_url=yes}} allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and their album entitled ''[[The Dethalbum]]'' debuted at No. 21 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 list.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 Dethalbum Debuts At #21 On Billboard Top 200] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705003124/http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 |date=5 July 2009 }}" 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17294">'''Comic book therapy''' is a form of [[art therapy]] in which those undergoing rehabilitation or those who have already completed rehabilitation express their experiences through personal narratives within a comics format. The combination of text and image enables patients to process their memories and emotions through two different, yet compatible mediums. Comic book therapy can also be used in a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] setting, whereby clients are encouraged to read specific [[comic book]]s, often surrounding topics similar to their own diagnoses. Clients are encouraged to present their thoughts and feelings they experienced while reading as well as to draw parallels with their own lived experiences based on the events that occur within the books.&lt;ref name="Comicspedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicspedia.net/|title=Comicspedia: the intersection of comic books and clinical psychology|last=O'Connor|first=Patrick|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in an effort to reach a [[Catharsis|cathartic]] moment of clarity and understanding of one's own life.

Both forms of therapy can be used throughout a patient's treatment process: immediately after diagnosis, throughout rehabilitation, and during the events that follow, including readjustment and general coping.

Comic book therapy is currently being applied to a variety of populations, including patients diagnosed with life-altering diagnoses (i.e. cancer, Dementia, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes, etc.), patients and family members experiencing severe illness or death, families undergoing therapy, sexual assault survivors, and soldiers returning from war.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McMullin|first=Juliet|date=2016-06-01|title=Cancer and the Comics: Graphic Narratives and Biolegitimate Lives|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maq.12172/abstract|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=149–167|doi=10.1111/maq.12172|issn=1548-1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warson|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-04-01|title=Healing Pathways: Art Therapy for American Indian Cancer Survivors|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13187-012-0324-5|journal=Journal of Cancer Education|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1007/s13187-012-0324-5|issn=0885-8195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czerwiec|first=M.

== Comic Book Therapy and Graphic Medicine ==
{{main|Graphic medicine}}

Graphic medicine, originally coined by [http://myriadeditions.com/creator/ian-williams/ Ian Williams], is a literary genre that combines the medium of comics and the discourse of medicine. Within the last ten years, graphic stories, which are also referred to as adult themed comics, have slowly become a rising pop-culture trend.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It owes its success in part to the rise of [[medical humanities]], an interdisciplinary study of medicine and healthcare related topics. While medical humanities incorporates a variety of language-based subjects (i.e. philosophy, ethics, religion, etc.), graphic medicine strives to analyze the same healthcare-related topics using an artistic lens. The genre combines the conventionality of text with the eccentricity of images to present intimate narratives related to healthcare or medical experiences. These narratives are also sometimes referred to as "graphic pathologies", as they commonly discuss diagnoses of injury, illness, or disease.

Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a collection of novels that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and their loved ones, but that serve as an educational tool for medical students as well.

The general concepts of graphic medicine and comic book therapy are often used interchangeably as they both strive to develop healthcare-related stories using both text and graphics. There is however a distinction that should be made. Graphic medicine acts as an umbrella term that encompasses a host of therapeutic techniques. Therefore, comic book therapy comfortably fits under its heading as just one of many therapies that the field of graphic medicine investigates.

== History ==
The foundations of the comics industry began in the early 1920's just after the culmination of the First World War.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/history-of-comics/|title=The History of Comics: Decade by decade {{!}} The Artifice|website=the-artifice.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially starting out as small black-and-white strips, comics predominantly acted as entertaining filler space within national and local magazines and newspapers around the country. It was not until 1929 with the publication of ''The Funnies #1'' that the first collection of comics material came about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The years following witnessed a spurt of comics publication that lasted up until present day with children and adults alike still knowing names like ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]], [[Superman (comic book)|Superman]], [[Peanuts]],'' and ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]].''

Professionals within the graphic medicine field trace the history of comics back further than the early 1920's, however. Instead, they claim the origin of their academic field can be traced back to prehistoric cave drawings and man's desire to express himself with pictures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this light, professors of graphic medicine and clinicians of comic book therapy include Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan and Aztecs drawings, and the great art of the Greeks, the Persians, and the Romans within the history of comic books as well.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.graphicmedicine.org/a-short-history-of-art-comics/|title=A Short History of "Art" Comics {{!}} Graphic Medicine|last=Williams|first=Ian|date=|work=Graphic Medicine|access-date=2018-02-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do, of course, begin the story of comics specifically in 1938 with the publication of [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics #1'']], the first to detail the adventures and heroic efforts of Superman.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=M|date=2017|title=Graphic Novels: A Brief History, Their Use in Business Education, and the Potential for Negotiation Pedagogy|url=|journal=Negotiation and Conflict Management Research|volume=10|pages=324–335|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of radio, television, and film only heightened the popularity of comic books and comic book characters; and by 1980, the merchandising of comic books hit an all time peak.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, comic books have slowly begun to matriculate within select topics of academia, now regarded as significant contributions to literary expression, covering topics of medicine, politics, economy, and social change.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Current Uses in Today's Medical Setting ==
Since its beginning, graphic medicine as a field of study has steadily become more relevant. As such, the use of comic book therapy as well as its functions have expanded as well. Today, comic books and graphic novels alike are being implemented in a variety of clinical and educational settings, likely due to its efforts in serving a variety of needs for a diverse target audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=M.J|date=1971|title=The use of graphic images in psychotherapy|url=|journal=American Journal of Art Therapy|volume=10|pages=153–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book therapies can serve multiple purposes. Some authors hope to relay information, creating a graphic encyclopedia of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=E|date=1997|title=The symbolic graphic life-line: Integrating the past and present through graphic imagery|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=14|pages=261–267|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapists often collaborate with patients in comic book therapy to develop a closer relationship based on the tenants of empathy and understanding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=A.J.|date=2017|title=Using comics to communicate about health: An introduction to the symposium on visual narratives and graphic medicine|url=|journal=Health Communication|volume=32|pages=523–524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients, more often than not, are encouraged to process difficult emotions and memories in the attempt to process, readjust, and engage in healthier coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Al-Jawad|first=Muna|date=2015-12-01|title=Comics are Research: Graphic Narratives as a New Way of Seeing Clinical Practice|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=36|issue=4|pages=369–374|doi=10.1007/s10912-013-9205-0|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its multiple functions, graphic medicine and comic book therapy have been implemented both therapeutically and educationally in the medical field.

=== Therapeutic Tool ===

==== Creating a comic book ====
One form of comic book therapy involves the creation of a comic strip, a comic book, or a graphic novel. The process by which a patient, family member, caregiver, or practitioner creates a comic book is complex and involves extensive research. In essence, the process of developing a comic book serves as a therapeutic coping mechanism that goes beyond text-based story telling. Instead, patients are pushed to think through multiple mediums. The process can sometimes, hopefully frequently, lead to significant cognitive and emotion breakthroughs. These effects are likely due to the sheer versatility of the comic book medium, as they allow for the simultaneous expression of body image, verbal expression, physical action, and emotion.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulholland|first=M.J.|date=2004|title=Comics as Art Therapy|url=|journal=Art Therapy|volume=21|pages=42–43|doi=10.1080/07421656.2004.10129317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapists often encourage patients to develop characters first, as this first step situates the patient in relation to their environment, past and present.&lt;ref name="McMullin 149–167"/&gt; Most often, the characters of comic book therapy novels imitate those within the author's own life, developing an autobiography of sorts. Occasionally, their experiences are identical to those of reality; often, an author chooses to reshape the narrative altogether, providing the reader an augmented reality of some kind.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Patients take this opportunity to rewrite their story, making choices they didn't or couldn't during their own experiences. The comic book aspect acts as a safe avenue of release, in which a patient can comfortably create a world in which the consequences of actions are limited to panels in which they develop.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, M.J. &amp; Myers, K.R.|first=|date=|title=Graphic medicine: use of comics in medical education and patient care.|url=|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=340|pages=574–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Reading a comic book ====
Another form of comic book therapy encourages patients, their support systems, and their healthcare providers to read already published graphic novels and comic books. As the field of graphic medicine has grown, so too have the collection of comic books and novels. As such, current graphic novels and comic books cover a wide range of topics, including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[eating disorder]]s, and so on. Popular novels include ''Cancervixen: a True Story'' by [[Marisa Acocella Marchetto]], ''Tangles: A Story About Alzheimer's, My Mother, and Me'' by [[Sarah Leavitt]], and ''Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo and Me'' by [[Ellen Forney]]. Therapists recommend novels that discuss similar experiences, similar diagnoses, similar personal histories to those of their own patients. Patients are encouraged to read them critically in the efforts of finding some kind of parallel between their own experiences and those described  within the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karno|first=M.|last2=Brunon|first2=J|last3=Arch|first3=M|last4=Waldron|first4=P|date=1977|title=Therapeutic use of generative graphics|url=|journal=Art Psychotherapy|volume=4|pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of therapy goes beyond just reading a recommended autobiography. The images and graphics within each panel add to the narrative, bridging a gap between words and meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The way in which an author chooses to depict their characters, the environment, and the text are all important and contribute largely the reading experience.

=== Educational Tool ===
Current professionals within the field are striving to develop a field of study that can act not only as a therapeutic tool for patients and healthcare providers alike, but that can serve as an educational tool for medical students as well. With the advancement of technology and the diversification of the patient population, medical practices has undergone significant change within the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmond|first=S.W.|last2=Echevarria|first2=M|date=|title=Healthcare Transformation and Changing Roles for Nursing|journal=Orthopedic Nursing|volume=36|issue=1|pages=12–25|doi=10.1097/NOR.0000000000000308|issn=0744-6020|pmc=5266427|pmid=28107295}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the education process prior to medical practice has remained arguably stagnant. Present day medical school programs cover material in three broad categories, including the scientific basis of medicine, patient care, and physicianship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu/medical-education/md-program|title=M.D. Program {{!}} Medical Education|website=medicaleducation.weill.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of teaching vary across universities, but the basic curricula remain the same across the board. With the evolution of medical practice arriving so quickly, some argue that medical training should follow in suit. According to the scholars of Graphic Medicine, there are multiple parallels between comic book therapy, when used as educational tool, and the everyday practice of medicine. In this way, having medical students engage in comic book therapy during their medical training could prove significant later on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael J.|last2=Myers|first2=Kimberly|last3=Watson|first3=Katie|last4=Czerwiec|first4=M. K.|last5=Shapiro|first5=Dan|last6=Draus|first6=Stephanie|date=2016-12-01|title=Creativity in Medical Education: The Value of Having Medical Students Make Stuff|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=475–483|doi=10.1007/s10912-016-9397-1|issn=1041-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hustle and bustle of medical practice can prove stressful, especially for a new doctor fresh out of medical school. In order to prove oneself within the medical field, many believe an individual must possess characteristics like 'competency', 'professionalism', and 'brilliance'; rarely are physicians referred to as 'artistically creative' or 'creative' at all.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One professor of graphic medicine believes this could be a problem in the future as it pushes medical students to stay within the limitations of an unoriginal box.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">'''Corporate entertainment''' describes private events held by [[corporation]]s or [[business]]es for their staff, clients or stakeholders. These events can be for large audiences such as conventions and conferences, or smaller events such as retreats, holiday parties or even private [[concert]]s.

It is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the process of entertaining guests at corporate events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.showsinabox.com/what-is-a-corporate-event/|title=What Is A Corporate Event? - Shows In a Box|date=2012-12-12|work=Shows In a Box|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies that provides corporate [[entertainment]] are called corporate event planners or corporate booking agencies.

== Types of corporate entertainment events ==
There are various types of corporate events that make use of entertainment.  An Opening General Session may include entertainment that adds excitement and presents the overall theme of the meeting. Mixers or pre-dinner parties many times use entertainment meant to provide a backdrop for conversation, perhaps an acoustic ensemble or pre-recorded music. Awards or Gala events, usually the last event in a series of meetings, can make use of many options, from [[celebrity]] entertainers to exciting bands providing dance music or other options that will leave the attendees with a feeling of excitement and looking forward to the next meeting. There are many different types of corporate entertainment.

=== Corporate team building ===
Corporate entertainment can also include a day of [[team building]] activities. These activities include traditional camp activities like tug of war, scavenger hunts, and relay races. They could also include sports such as volleyball, soccer, or basketball. The goal of team building corporate entertainment is to have employees recognize how the challenges of the activities relate to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jada A.

=== Corporate awards events ===
Awards or gala events are usually lavish events that celebrate accomplishment or milestones of a person or group of people in similar industries. Often these events serve as fundraisers for a specific cause. In addition to celebrating and recognizing achievements, it allows attendees to network with others with similar backgrounds or professions.

=== Corporate holiday celebration events ===
Holiday celebration events are ways for companies or departments to celebrate holidays and to show appreciation to employees. Entertainment at these events vary from raffles and door prizes, [[mystery dinner]]s, music and an overall casual, social setting that can build social relationships. For Christmas celebrations, companies have used the "[[A Christmas Story]]" theme.

=== Corporate seminars and educational events ===
Corporate seminars, workshops, symposiums, and conferences are more informative in nature and often focussed on educational purposes.  A conference refers to a formal meeting where participants exchange their views on various topics.  A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at a university or offered by a commercial or professional organization.  A workshop includes all the elements of the Seminar, but with the largest portion being emphasized on “hand-on-practice” or laboratory work.  A symposium is a formal gathering in an academic setting where participants are experts in their fields. Entertainment for these events varies from kick-op brunches to start, special industry guest speakers, and mixers, dinners  afterwards.  There are also booths set up for trade shows to display a companies strengths and for better marketing.

=== Corporate charity events ===
Corporate charity events, whether concerts, golf tournaments, or anything else, play an important role in how businesses interact with the community. Corporate charity events unite people from all levels of the organization; such events are another form of team building which positively influence other aspects of work.

[[File:Tihanyi The Critic.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Critic'' by [[Lajos Tihanyi]]. Oil on canvas, c.1916.]]

A '''critic''' is a professional who communicates an assessment and an opinion of various forms of creative works such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture, and food. Critics may also take as their subject social or government policy. Critical judgments, whether derived from [[critical thinking]] or not, weigh up a range of factors, including an assessment of the extent to which the item under review achieves its purpose and its creator's intention and a knowledge of its context. They may also include a positive or negative personal response.

Characteristics of a good critic are articulateness, preferably having the ability to use language with a high level of appeal and skill. Sympathy, sensitivity and insight are important too. Form, style and medium are all considered by the critic. In architecture and food criticism, the item's function, value and cost may be added components.

Critics are publicly accepted and, to a significant degree, followed because of the quality of their assessments or their reputation. Influential critics of art, music, theatre and architecture often present their arguments in complete books. One very famous example is [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' and ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''. Critics may base their assessment on a range of theoretical positions. For instance, they may take a Feminist or Freudian perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdP2BgxsM3wC|title=The Feminist Spectator as Critic|last=Dolan|first=Jill|date=2012-10-24|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472035193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via websites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to produce their assessment and opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet companies. When their personal opinion outweighs considered judgment, people who give opinions, whether on current events, public affairs, sports, media or art are often referred to as "[[pundits]]" instead of critics.

Critics are themselves subject to competing critics, since the final critical judgment always entails some [[subjectivity]]. An established critic can play a powerful role as a public [[arbitration|arbiter]] of taste or opinion. Also, critics or a coordinated group of critics, may award symbols of recognition.

== Derivation ==

The word "critic" comes {{ety|gre|''κριτικός'' (kritikós)|able to discern}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkritiko%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Kritikos'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a Greek derivation of the word {{lang|grc|κριτής}} ''(krités)'', meaning a person who offers reasoned judgment or analysis, value judgment, interpretation or observation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkrith%2Fs Greek-English Lexicon, at Perseus], ''Krites'', Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; Early English meaning of criticism was based mainly on the criticism of literature and it was in the 17th century that more general forms of criticism began.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Critics' views of criticism ==

Cultural critic [[Clement Greenberg]] wrote that a good critic excels through "insights into the evidence … and by … loyalty to the relevant"; poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]] wrote "a critic must have a very highly developed sense of fact".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art and Culture – Critical Essays|last = Greenberg|first = Clement|publisher = Beacon Press|year = 1961|isbn = |location = Boston|page = 239|chapter = T.S. Eliot: A Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Harold C. Schonberg]], chief music critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 1960 to 1980, said that he wrote for himself, &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;not necessarily for readers, not for musicians. ...It's not a critic's job to be right or wrong; it's his job to express an opinion in readable English.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/nyregion/harold-c-schonberg-87-dies-won-pulitzer-prize-as-music-critic-for-the-times.html|title=Harold C.

[[Daniel Mendelsohn]] described the equation of criticism for critics as [[knowledge]] + [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] = meaningful [[judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-critics-manifesto|title=A Critic’s Manifesto|last=Mendelsohn|first=Daniel|date=2012-08-28|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/everyones-a-critic-1455147994|title=Everyone’s a Critic|last=Spiegelman|first=Willard|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurant critic Terry Durack explained that from a critic "you hope for a thorough, objective and legitimate discussion" that puts "opera, art or book into context, so that it adds to your own body of knowledge"; in the context of a restaurant criticism, this means it is "not about me liking it or not; it's about me helping you decide whether you are going to like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-role-of-a-restaurant-critic-in-the-digital-age-20161201-gt1ndf.html|title=The role of a restaurant critic in the digital age|last=Durack|first=Terry|date=3 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=5 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotebox|quote=''Rothko's dilemma was that he wanted to employ the vocabulary of symbolism{{snds}}the palpitating indeterminate space, the excruciatingly refined colour, the obsession with nuance, the presence of Mallarmé's "negated object"{{snds}}to render the patriarchal despair and elevation of the Old Testament.

== Social and political critics ==

Social and political critics have used various forms of art to express their criticism, including literature and music. [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], for example, prior to the [[French Revolution]], used his play [[The Marriage of Figaro (play)|''The Marriage of Figaro'']] to denounce aristocratic privilege. A critic's influence is enhanced by subsequent reworkings such as the operatic versions of Beaumarchais's play (''[[The Barber of Seville]]'') by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'') by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. Among the most famous social/political criticism in literary form are [[Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift's]] [[satire]] ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and [[George Orwell]]'s satire ''[[Animal Farm]]''. Some political critics, such as [[Ai Weiwei]] use visual art as their medium. Throughout history, political critics have faced higher risks, including the risk of imprisonment or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/hrw-calls-for-release-of-thai-government-critic/3238970.html|title=HRW Calls for Release of Thai Government Critic|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2016/03/21/zambian-opposition-leader-arrested-for-defaming-president-lungu/|title=Zambian opposition leader arrested for ‘defaming’ President Lungu|website=africanews.channel|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pakistanis-throng-for-funeral-of-man-hanged-for-killing-critic-of-blasphemy-laws-1456855688|title=Pakistanis Throng Funeral of Man Hanged for Killing Critic of Blasphemy Laws|last=Shah|first=Saeed|last2=Nauman|first2=Qasim|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-nemtsov-idUSKCN0W00M4|title=Thousands march in Moscow to honor slain Kremlin critic Nemtsov|date=2016-02-28|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/beijing-critic-family-detained-china-internet-crackdown/3256261.html|title=Beijing Critic Says Family Detained in China in Internet Crackdown|website=VOA|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online critics ==

Several websites have developed for the purpose of compiling or publishing original critical reviews. Examples include ''[[Blogcritics|BlogCritics Magazine]]'', [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and [[Yelp]]. According to [[A. O. Scott]], chief film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', everyone on the Internet is a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/sunday-review/everybodys-a-critic-and-thats-how-it-should-be.html|title=Everybody’s a Critic.

== Responses to critics ==

People whose work is the subject of criticism have a full range of responses to it. For example, they may be appreciative, offended, distressed, encouraged, amused or nonplussed.
{{Quotebox|quote=''We do not object to criticism; and we do not expect that the critic will read the book before writing a notice of it.

'''Dance''' is a [[performing art]] [[art form|form]] consisting of purposefully selected sequences of [[kinesiology|human movement]]. This movement has [[aesthetic]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular [[culture]].{{refn|group=nb|Many definitions of dance have been proposed. This definition is based on the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Dance is human movement created and expressed for an aesthetic purpose."&lt;ref name="Fraleigh1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sondra Horton Fraleigh|title=Dance and the Lived Body: A Descriptive Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4FN1lOcR-wC&amp;pg=PA43|year=1987|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre|isbn=978-0822971702|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Dance is a transient mode of expression performed in a given form and style by the human body moving in space. Dance occurs through purposefully selected and controlled rhythmic movements; the resulting phenomenon is recognized as dance both by the performer and the observing members of a given group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joann Kealinohomoku|editor1-last=Copeland|editor1-first=Roger|editor2-last=Cohen|editor2-first=Marshall|title=An Anthropologist Looks at Ballet as a Form of Ethnic Dance|work=What is Dance? Readings in Theory and Criticism|date=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|edition=1983|url=http://lodev.wesleyan.edu/wespress/acceleratedmotion/primary_sources/texts/ecologiesofbeauty/anthro_ballet.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104220818/http://lodev.wesleyan.edu/wespress/acceleratedmotion/primary_sources/texts/ecologiesofbeauty/anthro_ballet.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Dance is human behaviour composed (from the dancer’s perspective, which is usually shared by the audience members of the dancer’s culture) of purposeful (individual choice and social learning play a role), intentionally rhythmical, and culturally patterned sequences of nonverbal body movement mostly other than those performed in ordinary motor activities. The motion (in time, space, and with effort) has an inherent and aesthetic value (the notion of appropriateness and competency as viewed by the dancer’s culture) and symbolic potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Lynne Hanna|title=The performer-audience connection: emotion to metaphor in dance and society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ze8TAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0292764781}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dance can be categorized and described by its [[choreography]], by its repertoire of movements, or by its [[History of dance|historical period]] or [[List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances by origin|place of origin]].

An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of [[Concert dance|theatrical]] and [[Participation dance|participatory]] dance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsalive.ca/en/dan/dance101/forms.asp Canadian National Arts Centre – Dance Forms: An Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether [[Social dance|social]], [[ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[competitive dance|competitive]], [[erotic dance|erotic]], [[war dance|martial]], or [[sacred dance|sacred]]/[[liturgical dance|liturgical]]. Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronized swimming]], marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.

==Performance and participation==
[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Members of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]

Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].

Participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.

==Origins==
[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]

[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC. It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="lecomte"&gt;Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp&amp;nbsp;94–108.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of dance in [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] and healing rituals (as observed today in many contemporary "primitive" cultures, from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]]) is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance.&lt;ref name="guenther"&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v. 30, 1975–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

References to dance can be found in very early recorded history; [[Greek dance]] (''[[horos]]'') is referred to by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Raftis, Alkis, ''The World of Greek Dance'' Finedawn, Athens (1987) p25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible]] and [[Talmud]] refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kadman|first=Gurit|date=1952|title=Yemenite Dances and Their Influence on the New Israeli Folk Dances|jstor=835838|journal=Journal of the International Folk Music Council|volume=4|pages=27–30|doi=10.2307/835838}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[History of Chinese classical dance|Chinese]] pottery as early as the [[Neolithic]] period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.chnmuseum.cn/Default.aspx?TabId=549&amp;AntiqueLanguageID=3002|title=Basin with design of dancers|publisher=National Museum of China|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-23}} Pottery from the [[Majiayao culture]] (3100 BC to 2700 BC)&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest Chinese word for "dance" is found written in the [[oracle bones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The history of Chinese dance|last=Kʻo-fen|first=Wang|date=1985|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=9780835111867|oclc=977028549|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance is further described in the ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]''.&lt;ref name="aesthetic tradition"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1eZuB2xwYwC&amp;pg=PA5|title=The Chinese aesthetic tradition|first=Zehou|last=Li|first2=Maija Bell|last2=Samei|date=2010|publisher=University of Hawaiʻi Press|isbn=9780824833077|oclc=960030161|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&amp;id=23281|title=Lü Shi Chun Qiu|last=Sturgeon|first=Donald|website=Chinese Text Project Dictionary|language=cn|access-date=2017-05-23|quote=Original text: 昔葛天氏之樂，三人操牛尾，投足以歌八闋}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.

During the first millennium [[common era|BCE]] in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''"the text of dramaturgy"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types – secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive – and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other contemporary dance forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.

==Dance and music==
{{main|Dance music}}

Dance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].

== Dance and rhythm ==
'''[[Rhythm]] and dance''' are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; "The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish."&lt;ref name="Shawn 50"&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the "beat" or "tactus") that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.
[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]
Dances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a "slow", lasts for one beat, so that a full "right–left" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted – "slow-slow" – while many additional figures are counted "slow – quick-quick.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as musical rhythms are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depends on alternating "strong" and "weak" muscular movements.&lt;ref name="Kirstein 4"&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. However, since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other – such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike – some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.

[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund – The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p. 107), The inscription reads; "Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity."]]
The very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an "initial skeleton of rhythmic beats" that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.&lt;ref name="Kirstein 4"/&gt;

Musical accompaniment therefore arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the "measures and perfect concords of harmony" that fall upon the human ear,&lt;ref name="Kirstein 4"/&gt; while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying "I have piped and ye have not danced",&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 11:17&lt;/ref&gt; writes;

{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest. If thou wouldst have me spring aloft, sing thou and I will spring, into love and from love to knowledge and from knowledge to ecstasy above all human sense&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s celebrated 16th century dance-treatise ''Orchésographie'', indeed, begins with definitions of over eighty distinct drum-rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dancing with Helen Moller; her own statement of her philosophy and practice and teaching formed upon the classic Greek model, and adapted to meet the aesthetic and hygienic needs of to-day, with (14784705065).jpg|thumb|right|Helen Moller]]
As has been shown above, dance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as [[Lincoln Kirstein]] implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance. Shawn concurs, stating that dance "was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew" and that even the "[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously"&lt;ref name="Shawn 50"/&gt; – an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term "foot" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.

[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the "incalculable" influence of dance upon music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Dance |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him "to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism", to develop "a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves" and ultimately to seek the connections between "the art of music and the art of dance", which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, "it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance", nevertheless the "two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music",&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named "[[waltz]]" or "[[minuet]]", for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of "measure" or "metre" from poetry.

Shawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents "according to physiological law", that of "plastic rhythm" (i.e. dance) "is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations".

Shawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a "man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all", being "the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that "it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble."&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to dance==

===Concert dance===
Concert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely "plotless" ballets in the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&amp;dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

The [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,&lt;ref&gt;Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].

Ballet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the "rhythm and shape" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2, 4 ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt; while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of "primitive rhythmic movements",&lt;ref&gt;Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.&lt;ref&gt;Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and "pure" dance. In this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.

Japanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).&lt;ref name="Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki « MIT Global Shakespeares | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Furyū Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.&lt;ref name="Ortolani"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage&amp;q=mugen-no%20Genzai-no%20waki-no&amp;f=false |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=978-0691043333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participatory and social dance===
[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ayansu, E.S. and Whitfield, P. (eds.), ''The Rhythms Of Life'', Marshall Editions, 1982, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural traditions==

Dance in Africa is deeply integrated into society and major events in a community are frequently reflected in dances: dances are performed for births and funerals, weddings and wars.&lt;ref name="WelshHanley2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kariamu Welsh|author2=Elizabeth A. Hanley|author3=Jacques D'Amboise|title=African Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXDWJiRr0PYC|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1604134773}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} Traditional dances impart cultural morals, including religious traditions and sexual standards; give vent to repressed emotions, such as [[grief]]; motivate community members to cooperate, whether fighting wars or grinding grain; enact spiritual rituals; and contribute to [[structural cohesion|social cohesiveness]].&lt;ref name="Hanna1973" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanna|first1=Judith Lynne|title=African Dance: the continuity of change|journal=Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council|date=1973|volume=5|pages=165–174|jstor=767501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of dances are performed around the continent. These may be divided into traditional, neotraditional, and classical styles: [[folklore|folkloric]] dances of a particular society, dances created more recently in imitation of traditional styles, and dances transmitted more formally in schools or private lessons.&lt;ref name="WelshHanley2010" /&gt;{{rp|18}} African dance has been altered by many forces, such as European [[missionaries]] and [[colonialist]] governments, who often suppressed local dance traditions as licentious or distracting.&lt;ref name="Hanna1973" /&gt; Dance in contemporary African cultures still serves its traditional functions in new contexts; dance may celebrate the inauguration of a hospital, build community for rural migrants in unfamiliar cities, and be incorporated into Christian church ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Hanna1973" /&gt;

[[File:Nandini Ghosal.jpg|thumb|left|An Indian classical dancer]]

===Asia===

All [[Classical Indian dance|Indian classical dances]] are to varying degrees rooted in the ''[[Natyashastra]]'' and therefore share common features: for example, the ''mudra''s (hand positions), some body positions, and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or [[abhinaya]]. Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.

There are now many regional varieties of [[Indian classical dance]]. Dances like ''"Odra Magadhi"'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P.C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.

The [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient "[[Ayurvedic]]" concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology. Their influence can be seen on the [[classical dances of Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankalibrary.com/rit/yakun%20natuma.htm Lankalibrary.com], "The yakun natima&amp;nbsp;— devil dance ritual of Sri Lanka"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Eastern dance|dances of the Middle East]] are usually the traditional forms of [[circle dance|circle dancing]] which are modernized to an extent. They would include [[dabke]], [[tamzara]], [[Assyrian folk dance]], [[Kurdish dance]], [[Armenian dance]] and [[Turkish dance]], among others.&lt;ref name="Badley 2000. pp 391-395"&gt;Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi.

Hacaloğlu, 1992; p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; All these forms of dances would usually involve participants engaging each other by holding hands or arms (depending on the style of the dance). They would make rhythmic moves with their legs and shoulders as they curve around the dance floor. The head of the dance would generally hold a [[Walking stick|cane]] or [[handkerchief]].&lt;ref name="Badley 2000. pp 391-395"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subhi Anwar Rashid, Mesopotamien, Abb 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and North America===
{{Main|Concert dance}}
[[Folk dance]]s vary across Europe and may date back hundreds or thousands of years, but many have features in common such as [[group dance|group participation]] led by a [[Caller (dancing)|caller]], hand-holding or arm-linking between participants, and fixed musical forms known as caroles.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ballet in Western Culture: A History of Its Origins and Evolution|pages=10–11|year=2002|isbn=978-0415942577|author=Carol Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as the [[maypole]] dance are common to many nations, while others such as the [[céilidh]] and the [[polka]] are deeply-rooted in a single culture. Some European folk dances such as the [[square dance]] were brought to the [[New World]] and subsequently became part of American culture.

[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Académie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.&lt;ref name="lecomte"/&gt;

[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].

[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. [[Tap dance]], [[disco]], [[jazz dance]], [[swing dance]], [[hip hop dance]], the [[lindy hop]] with its relationship to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]] and [[rock and roll (dance)|rock and roll dance]] have had a global influence.

===Latin America===
Dance is central to [[Latin America]]n social life and culture. Brazilian [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|Samba]], Argentinian [[tango]], and Cuban [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] are internationally popular partner dances, and other national dances—[[merengue (dance)|merengue]], [[cueca]], [[plena]], [[jarabe]], [[joropo]], [[marinera]], [[cumbia]], and others—are important components of their respective countries' cultures.&lt;ref name="Chasteen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Charles Chasteen|title=National Rhythms, African Roots: The Deep History of Latin American Popular Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBvvvrydCNwC&amp;pg=PR8|date=1 January 2004|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0826329417|pages=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[Carnival]] festivals incorporate these and other dances in enormous celebrations.&lt;ref name="MusmonHanley2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret Musmon|author2=Elizabeth A.

===United States===
Hip Hop originated in New York, specifically in the area known as the Bronx. It was created for those who struggled in society and didn't seem to have a voice in the community that surrounded them because of their lack of wealth. It helped those in the same situation come together and speak about difficult topics by using movement and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thoughteconomics.com/the-role-of-hip-hop-in-culture/|title=The Role of Hip Hop in Culture |date=2015-11-03|work=Thought Economics|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance education==

Dance studies are offered through the [[The Arts|arts]] and [[humanities]] programs of many higher education institutions. Some universities offer [[Bachelor of Arts]] and higher [[academic degree]]s in Dance. A dance study curriculum may encompass a diverse range of courses and topics, including dance practice and performance, choreography, [[ethnochoreology]], [[kinesiology]], [[dance notation]], and [[dance therapy]].

==Occupations==
{{Main|List of dance occupations}}

===Professional dancers===
Professional dancers are usually employed on contract or for particular performances or productions. The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagolla|first=Lisa|date=April 24, 2008|title=Untitled|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fa35d8ae-239b-4764-b82f-f58a07a15475%40sessionmgr4006&amp;vid=11&amp;hid=4104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=32038206&amp;db=ibh|journal=International Bibliography of Theatre &amp; Dance with Full Text|volume= 15| issue = 17 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance teachers===
Dance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, [[dancesport]] teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by [[dance school]]s or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.

===Choreographers===
[[Choreography (dance)|Choreographers]] are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.

==Competitions==

A '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes. There are several major types of dance competitions, distinguished primarily by the style or styles of dances performed. Major types of dance competitions include:
* '''[[Competitive dance]]''', in which a variety of theater dance styles, such as [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[tap dance|tap]], are permitted.
* '''Open''' competitions, that permit a wide variety of dance styles. An example of this is the TV program ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''.
* '''[[Dancesport]]''', which is focused exclusively on [[ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[latin dance]]. Examples of this are TV programs ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.
* '''Single-style''' competitions, such as; [[Scottish highland dance|highland dance]], [[dance squad|dance team]], and [[Irish dance]], that only permit a single dance style.

In addition, there are numerous dance competitions shows [[Dance on television|presented on television]] and other mass media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11914">A '''dance squad''' or '''dance team''', sometimes called a '''pom squad''' or '''song team''', is a team of participants that participates in [[competitive dance]]. In a routine, a squad will incorporate a specific dance style (i.e. [[hip hop]],  [[jazz]], or [[lyrical dance|lyrical]]), technical work (leaps, turns, kicks, splits, jumps), and, depending on the routine, [[pom-pom]]s and/or [[cheering|cheers]]. A pom squad slightly differs from a regular dance squad in that it uses pom-poms in all its dance routines, whilst a regular dance squad may or may not do pom work in a dance routine. Dance teams are also popular in [[Concert dance|performance dance]], especially at sporting events, most commonly performing during the pre-game and halftime periods (and, in a number of cases, on the sidelines) of football and basketball games.
[[File:Spartan Gs Dance Team.JPG|thumb|The [[UNC Greensboro Spartans|Spartan Gs]], a collegiate dance team]]
Dance is a highly competitive activity. Youth/association, middle school, high school, collegiate, all-star, and professional teams, compete on local, regional, state, national, and international levels. Teams are judged on a number of criteria including form, team unison, showmanship, precision of motions, jumps, leaps, turns, choreography, enthusiasm, and, in the case of pom squads, visual use of poms-poms. Pom squads are like cheerleading or dance, but they use poms (pom-poms). Pom squads also use kicklines in their routines, after they set down their poms, or choose to hold them during the kickline. A kickline routine is a routine of kicks, which cheerleaders also use:  high kicks, fan kicks, low kicks, and kicks that go to their waist. Pom squads regularly compete in competitions and perform at sporting events.

==Overview==
Dance squads emphasize precise, synchronized motions along with technical dance skills (such as jumps, turns, and leaps). Their routines encompass various styles of dance including the more usually incorporated [[hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], and [[kickline]] styles, to the more unusually used styles like [[disco]], [[rock and roll]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. A key feature of the dance is the ability to change formations very smoothly.

==Types of dance squads==

===High school and collegiate pom===

Traditional high school dance/pom squads include competition, performance dance, and promoting school spirit with dance. Dance/pom is usually a year-round sport, performing in competitions and at sporting events, most commonly football and basketball games. Some schools also have their dance team perform short sideline dances, and some dance teams also perform at school [[pep rally|pep rallies]].

College dance squads are like traditional high school squads in that both include competition and performance dance, but there are many differences between the two. For example, a college squad will most likely dance on the sidelines at games or have a specific spot in the stands, whereas high schools usually reserve this activity for [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsity.com/event/1164/college_dance.aspx |title=Dance Team - College Dance Team |publisher=Varsity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-star===

The [[U.S. All Star Federation]] governs all-star dance-pom squads.

Tryouts for all-star dance squads may be conducted in different ways. Some teams have only one tryout in the spring, whereas others may have a tryout in the spring and another in the fall. Some squads have year-round open tryouts where anyone can try out at any time during the season. The opportunity to compete in many large competitions attracts dancers to all-star programs. All-star dance teams can compete regionally, nationally, and even internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varsity.com/event/1163/allstar_dance.aspx |title=Dance Team - All Star Dance Team |publisher=Varsity.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas dance/drill teams===

Most high schools in Texas have a precision dance/drill team, usually with 25-75 members. The traditional uniform for teams typically includes a white hat and white boots, with team officers wearing a solid white uniform while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies. They often conclude the year with a spring show in late April or early May.

Texas dance/drill teams are structured with a chain of command similar to the military including captains and lieutenants leading squads. Traditionally, Texas drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years.

Several colleges in Texas also have dance teams. Well-known teams include the [[Kilgore College Rangerettes]] and the [http://www.tjc.edu/belles/ Tyler Junior College Apache Belles]. A fierce but friendly rivalry between KC &amp; TJC has existed since the Apache Belles were formed in 1947. The Rangerettes were the first college drill team created in 1939 by Miss Gussie Nell Davis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/history_drillteam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, created the [[Texas State University Strutters|Strutters]] at Southwest Texas State University (now [[Texas State University]]), the first precision dance team created at a four-year university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/history_drillteam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSHSL dance team===

In Minnesota, competitive high school dance team is regulated under the [[Minnesota State High School League]]. The season begins after a two-week choreography period in October and ends after the state tournament in February each year. Team selection is led by the coaching staff in a tryout process individual to each participating school.

Teams within this league are able to compete in one of three class divisions: A, AA, or AAA and in one or both of two categories: high kick or jazz. The high kick division requires a routine that ranges from 2:30 to 3:00 in length, contains 45-60 kicks performed by all members, and consists of up to 34 competing members. The jazz division has a range between 2:30 and 3:00 in length and may have up to 26 competing members. Music selection is done by the coaching staff and/or members of the team. Throughout the state, a wide variety of costume styles are worn to enhance the theme or mood of each routine.

During the competition season, teams compete within their designated conference, at team invites, within designated sections, and may qualify to compete at the state tournament. Visit [[MSHSL dance team judging]] for more information on dance team scoring process. In addition to competitions, MSHSL dance teams also can perform at invitationals and school events including pep fests and basketball games.

===Professional===
Professional cheerleading incorporates a lot of pom dance styles, particularly in [[National Football League Cheerleading|NFL Cheerleading]] and [[National Basketball Association Cheerleading|NBA Cheerleading]].

==Tryouts==
Many dance squads both in high school and  college require everyone to attend a tryout. These are typically held in the spring or early summer, before most sports begin. There are many different aspects of a tryout. The first thing many tryouts do is go through basic dance techniques that will be used during the season. These include but are not limited to toe touches, fouetté turn combinations, kicks, and switch leaps. Other things that are many times included in a dance team tryout is the expectation that you can quickly master multiple short routines in different styles. Depending on what type of dance team the tryout is for will depend on what styles of dance you must know. NDA teams compete with routines that must incorporate jazz, hip hop, and pom styles, so many times you will learn a routine in each of these types of dance and then perform them shortly thereafter in front of a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/1344 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520161625/http://www.dancespirit.com/articles/1344 |date=May 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
In 1967, the legendary Dr. [[Kay Teer Crawford]] (1914-2001) founded [[Miss Dance Drill Team USA]], which is historically verified as the first [http://www.mddtusa.com national dance team competition] for precision dance teams, drill teams, and dance-sport teams in the United States. This event is recognized as the origin of the worldwide dance competition industry and hosts dance squads from elementary schools, secondary schools, and dance studios from across the United States. In 1981, Crawford started the world's first international dance/drill competition (Miss Dance Drill Team International World Championships) which has regularly hosted past international dance teams from the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], and [[South Africa]]. In 1991, Crawford founded the world's first [http://www.mddtusa.com/street-dance-usa-national-hip-hop-dance-competition/ national hip hop dance competition]: National Street Dance USA. All events are held in the continental United States, with national events held in California each year.

On October 7, 2016, during the [[2016 United States presidential election]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a video and accompanying article about then-presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] and television host [[Billy Bush]] having "an extremely lewd conversation about women" in 2005. Trump and Bush were in a bus on their way to film an episode of ''Access Hollywood'' (now [[Access (U.S. TV program)|''Access'']]), a show owned by [[NBCUniversal]]. In the video, Trump described his attempt to seduce a married woman and indicated he might start kissing a woman that he and Bush were about to meet. He added, "I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the [[Pussy#Female genitalia|pussy]]. You can do anything." Commentators and lawyers have described such an action as [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-10-07/hot-mic-catches-donald-trump-bragging-about-sexual-assault|title=The Very Definition of Sexual Assault|last=Arrowood|first=Emily|date=October 7, 2016|work=U.S. News|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the recording broke two days before the second [[United States presidential election debates, 2016#Second presidential debate (Washington University in St. Louis)|2016 presidential debate]] between Trump, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]. Trump gave a statement in which he apologized for the video's content, but deflected by saying that [[Bill Clinton]] had "said far worse to me on the golf course".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Ian|title=Trump claims Bill Clinton said 'far worse to me' amid storm over lewd remarks about women|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-women-grab-them-bill-clinton-far-worse-a7351376.html|work=The Independent|date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recording provoked strong reactions by media figures and politicians across the political spectrum. Statements from Republican officials were varied. Some, including Trump's [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] [[running mate]] [[Mike Pence]], [[United States Senate Majority Leader|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]], and [[Republican National Committee]] Chairman [[Reince Priebus]], indicated their disapproval of Trump's words but did not renounce their support or call for his resignation from the ticket. Other Republicans, most prominently former presidential nominee [[John McCain]], stated that they would no longer support Trump's presidential campaign, and some called for his withdrawal from the ticket. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Paul Ryan]] announced that he would no longer defend or support Trump's campaign, although he did not officially retract his endorsement of Trump. Bush resigned from his position as a host on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show, while Trump received [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|allegations of sexual misconduct from several women]].

==Recording==
The video was recorded in September 2005 in the [[The Burbank Studios|NBC Studios]] parking lot while Trump was preparing to appear in an episode of the NBC [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. ''[[Access Hollywood]]'',&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold/&gt; a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] entertainment news program owned by [[NBCUniversal]],&lt;ref name="WP-LewdTape-RaceWasOn" /&gt; conducted a behind-the-scenes interview with Trump about the guest appearance in which Trump and Bush arrived in a [[tour bus]] for the ''Access Across America'' series of segments produced in commemoration of the program's 10th season. It features audio of Trump talking with Billy Bush, then co-anchor of ''Access Hollywood'', on a bus embellished with the show's name. Trump and Bush were wearing microphones, [[microphone gaffe|which recorded their casual conversation]]. Trump was later described as "apparently aware at the time that he was being recorded by a TV program".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/nbc-delayed-publication-of-lewd-trump-tape-because-of-lawsuit-fears/2016/10/08/a3c6850e-8db9-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html |title=NBC waited for green light from lawyers before airing Trump video |last=Farhi |first=Paul |date=October 8, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post |issn=0190-8286|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2016/10/08/how-access-hollywood-unearthed-donald-trumps-vulgar-video/ |title=How 'Access Hollywood' unearthed Donald Trump's vulgar video |last=Tacopino |first=Joe |date=October 8, 2016 |work=New York Post|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an ''Access Hollywood'' spokesperson, there were seven other people on the bus: a camera crew of two, the bus driver, the show's producer, a [[production assistant]], Trump's security guard, and Trump's public relations representative. Upon arriving at the lot, the camera crew was let off the bus so they could record Trump and Bush disembarking and meeting with [[Arianne Zucker]], who portrayed [[Nicole Walker]] on the soap opera and appeared alongside Trump in the episode in which he guest starred.&lt;ref name = "explain"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/donald-trump-comments-women-access-hollywood-229331 |title=Access Hollywood, Washington Post explain how they found the Donald Trump video |publisher=[[Politico]] blogs|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/trump-reax-groping-tape-apology/503462/ |title=Trump Apologizes for Groping Video and Attacks the Clintons |last=Graham |first=David A. |newspaper=The Atlantic |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video, Trump tells [[Billy Bush]] about a failed attempt to seduce [[Nancy O'Dell]], who was Bush's co-host at the time (circa 2005) of the recording:&lt;ref name="UST O'Dell"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Deerwester |first1=Jayme |title=Nancy O'Dell breaks her silence on vulgar Donald Trump recording |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/10/08/donald-trump-billy-bush-were-talking-nancy-odell-leaked-audio/91786526/ |work=USA Today |date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Access Hollywood'', the discovery of the video was prompted by "Mr. Trump's denial of claims contained in an [[Associated Press]] story in which 20 former ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|Apprentice]]'' employees described Mr. Trump's behavior toward women as lewd and inappropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.accesshollywood.com/videos/donald-trump-the-comments-on-women-you-hadnt-heard/ |title=Donald Trump: The Comments On Women You Hadn't Heard |publisher=Access Hollywood|access-date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An NBC source said that an ''Access Hollywood'' producer remembered the conversation on Monday, October 3, and located it in the show's archives.&lt;ref name="WP-LewdTape-RaceWasOn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/07/media/access-hollywood-donald-trump-tape/index.html|title=How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposed|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=October 7, 2016|publisher=CNNMoney|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrity news website ''[[TMZ]]'' reports a different chronology: when senior executives at NBC learned about the video, they thought it was too early in the presidential campaign season to release it with maximum effect, and (according to ''TMZ'') those executives publicly said they learned of the video long after they actually learned about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.tmz.com/#article/2016/10/12/nbc-trump-tape-billy-bush-plan-election-debate/ "NBC Planned to Use Trump Audio to Influence Debate, Election"], [[TMZ]] (October 12, 2016): "Multiple sources connected with NBC tell us ... top network execs knew about the video long before they publicly said they did, but wanted to hold it because it was too early in the election.

NBC discussed whether to release the tape and had lawyers review the legality of the publication, as is common among other news media due to the possibility that the involved parties might file a lawsuit if the video was released.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By Tuesday, October 4, NBC had drafted a story that it declined to broadcast for another three days.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fernandez"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://people.com/politics/donald-trump-hot-mic-tape-leaked/ |title=This Is How the Hot Mic Tape of Donald Trump Was Leaked |last=Fernandez |first=Alexia |date=October 8, 2016 |publisher=People |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday, October 7, at around 11 a.m., an unidentified source gave a copy of the tape to ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter [[David Fahrenthold]], who contacted NBC for comment, notified the Trump campaign that he had the video, obtained confirmation of its authenticity, and released a story and the tape itself by 4 p.m.&lt;ref name = Fahrenthold/&gt;&lt;ref name=WP-LewdTape-RaceWasOn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-caller-had-a-lewd-tape-of-donald-trump-then-the-race-was-on/2016/10/07/31d74714-8ce5-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html |title=A caller had a lewd tape of Donald Trump.

[[John F.

It has been argued, however, that despite Trump having stated "I don't even wait," his full remarks could imply something akin to consent.

===Involved parties===
====Billy Bush====
While the controversy has focused mainly on Trump, Bush also faced backlash as a result of the tape,&lt;ref name="Yahr"&gt;{{cite news |author=Emily Yahr |author2=Elahe Izadi |title=Billy Bush was already polarizing. His lewd Donald Trump conversation makes things much worse. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/07/billy-bush-was-already-polarizing-his-lewd-donald-trump-conversation-makes-things-much-worse/ |work=The Washington Post |date=October 7, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to his statement that Zucker "[is] hot as shit" and his goading her into hugging Trump after they get off the bus. Bush received online criticism and calls for his resignation from ''[[The Today Show]]'', where he was an anchor at the time. ''The Washington Post'' stated, "Bush's public image was damaged—perhaps beyond repair."&lt;ref name="Yahr"/&gt; There were so many negative comments on Bush's social media accounts following the tape's release that his [[Twitter]] account was taken down on the evening of October 7.&lt;ref name = "Yahr"/&gt; That evening, Bush issued an apology, saying, "Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago—I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry."&lt;ref name="Yahr" /&gt;

The controversy has led to speculation that Bush's spot on ''Today'' could be in jeopardy, both because of the backlash against him on social media and the possibility that the tape's release could create a [[Workplace conflict|toxic work environment]] between Bush and the show's mostly female production staff.&lt;ref name ="Busd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/billy-bush-declared-safe-in-today-show-gig-has-a-lot-of-work-to-do-monday-229407 |title=Billy Bush, declared 'safe' in 'Today' show gig, has a lot of work to do Monday |publisher=Politico blogs |date=October 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] executives confirmed on the evening of October 8 that Bush's job was safe and he would address the controversy on the October 10 episode of ''Today''.&lt;ref name ="Busd"/&gt; ''[[Politico]]'' noted that the audience of ''Today'' is disproportionately female so that a significant ratings drop in the wake of the controversy could still lead to Bush's dismissal.&lt;ref name="Busd"/&gt; On Monday, October 10, NBC reversed course and announced that Bush would be suspended from ''Today'' indefinitely pending further review;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/09/media/billy-bush-nbc-today-show-donald-trump/ |title=Billy Bush suspended from "Today" show |last=Stelter |first=Brian |date=October 10, 2016 |publisher=CNNMoney |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was an anchor, his suspension was briefly addressed during that day's broadcast.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 20161011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Billy Bush and NBC working on separation agreement | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=October 11, 2016 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/11/billy-bush-and-nbc-working-on-separation-agreement/ | accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, on October 11, multiple media sources reported that NBC was "negotiating his exit".&lt;ref name="Washington Post 20161011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pagesix.com/2016/10/11/nbc-insiders-say-billy-bush-will-be-fired/ |title=NBC insiders say Billy Bush will be fired |newspaper=New York Post |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Koblin | first=John | title=Billy Bush Negotiating Exit From NBC After Lewd Tape | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 11, 2016 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/business/media/billy-bush-to-make-abrupt-exit-from-nbc-after-lewd-tape.html | accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, NBC announced that Bush had resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Koblin |title=Billy Bush Officially Departs NBC |date=October 17, 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/business/media/billy-bush-officially-departs-nbc.html |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's status as a member of the [[Bush family]] (specifically, as the cousin of former President [[George W. Bush]] and the nephew of former president [[George H. W. Bush]]&lt;ref name="Washington Post 20161011"/&gt;) was also noted in the wake of the controversy. ''[[The Economist]]'' noted, "Who would have thought that Mr. Bush, a presenter of NBC's ''Today'' news show, could end up playing a more influential role in this election than his cousin [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]], whom many Republicans had expected to win it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=J.A. |title=Lecher-in-chief: Donald Trump boasts of groping women |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/10/lecher-chief |work=[[The Economist]] |location=London |date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====People and entities mentioned by Trump====
Nancy O'Dell, the married woman that Trump spoke of, said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Politics aside, I'm saddened that these comments still exist in our society at all. When I heard the comments yesterday, it was disappointing to hear such objectification of women. The conversation needs to change because no female, no person, should be the subject of such crass comments, whether or not cameras are rolling. Everyone deserves respect no matter the setting or gender. As a woman who has worked very hard to establish her career, and as a mom, I feel I must speak out with the hope that as a society we will always strive to be better.&lt;ref name="UST O'Dell" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to having their product referenced by Trump on the tape, [[Tic Tac]] issued a statement on Twitter stating, "Tic Tac respects all women. We find the recent statements and behavior completely inappropriate and unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=TicTacUSA|number=784831611531436032 |publisher=Tic Tac USA|title=Tic Tac respects all women.

Reacting to her unwitting role in this incident, Zucker wrote on TwitLonger, "How we treat one another, whether behind closed doors, locker rooms or face to face, should be done with kindness, dignity and respect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Arianne Zucker]] |url=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/nn05u1 |publisher=TwitLonger |date=October 9, 2016 |title=My name is Arianne &lt;!-- there is no real title here; these are the first words --&gt; |accessdate=October 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011140125/http://www.twitlonger.com/show/nn05u1 |archivedate=October 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/10/10/arianne-zucker-responds-to-donald-trumps-comments-about-her-on-access-hollywood-bus.html |publisher=FOX News |date=October 10, 2016 |title=Arianne Zucker responds to Donald Trump's comments about her on Access Hollywood bus |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican Party===
The incident was condemned by numerous prominent Republicans. [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC) Chairman [[Reince Priebus]] said, "No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever." The RNC suspended all support of Trump's campaign shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/rnc-halts-all-victory-project-work-for-trump-229363 |title=RNC halts Victory project work for Trump |newspaper=Politico |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/reince-priebus-says-rnc-will-stand-trump-n663996 |date=October 10, 2016 |title=Lines Drawn.

Pence himself released a statement on October 8, saying, "As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday ... I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them." However, he said he still supported Trump since he "has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people."&lt;ref name="Support"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flores |first1=Reena |title=Mike Pence: "I cannot defend" Trump's words |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-i-cannot-defend-trumps-words/ |publisher=CBS News |date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pence"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/10/08/pence-says-he-cant-defend-trumps-comments/91786874/ |title=Pence says he can't defend Trump's comments |author=Maureen Groppe |author2=Chelsea Schneider |author3=Tony Cook |newspaper=The Indianapolis Star |date=October 8, 2016 |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Withdrawal of political support====
As the day wore on, a growing number of Republicans went beyond criticizing Trump's remarks or rescinding endorsements of him and began calling for Trump to drop out of the presidential race, ceding the Republican nomination to another person.&lt;ref name="CanhamBurr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VitaliSarlin"/&gt; On the afternoon of October 8, Trump responded with a tweet: "The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #[[Make America Great Again|MAGA]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=realDonaldTrump|number=784840992734064641 |title=The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA|author=Donald J.

Trump acknowledged making the remarks, but tried to deflect by saying that Bill and Hillary Clinton had said and done worse.

After the release of the ''Access Hollywood'' video, Trump's first public response came in the form of a written statement published on his campaign website:

Early on Saturday morning, October 8, Donald Trump issued a lengthier statement, released by video. In it, Trump said of the video's contents, "I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize." He went on to "pledge to be a better man" and ended the video with the allegation that Bill Clinton, former President of the United States and husband of Trump's Democratic rival [[Hillary Clinton]], had "abused women", and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-defends-lewd-2005-conversation-about-women-as-locker-room-banter/ |title='I never said I'm a perfect person,' Trump says about lewd comments|access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's video ended with assurances that the Clinton allegations would be discussed in coming days.&lt;ref name="lewd-apology-nyt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/donald-trump-apology.html |title=Donald Trump's Apology That Wasn't |last=Haberman |first=Maggie |date=October 8, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's statement was criticized severely by the media and members of the public as insincere, and an attempt to divert attention away from Trump's comments and onto unsubstantiated accusations against his political opponents.&lt;ref name="lewd-apology-nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewd-apology-huff"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lavender |first1=Paige |title=Donald Trump 'Apologizes' In Recording That Looks Like A Hostage Tape |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-women_us_57f8535ae4b0e655eab47f82/ |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewd-apology-cnn"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=Trump issues defiant apology for lewd remarks -- then goes on the attack |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/07/politics/donald-trump-women-vulgar/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump tweeted the next day: "Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tweets-leaked-audio-women-billy-bush-2016-10 |title=TRUMP: 'Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!' |date=October 8, 2016 |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |author=Pamela Engel |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=realDonaldTrump|number=784767399442653184|author=Donald J.

He reiterated that it was "locker room talk", then said, "I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript of the Second Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/transcript-second-debate.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump's wife [[Melania Trump|Melania]] said, "The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know." She added that she hopes "people will accept his apology, as I have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/08/melania-trump-urges-america-forgive-trump-vulgar-comments/91791400/ |title=Melania blasts 'offensive' Trump, says she accepts apology |last=Collins |first=Eliza |date=October 8, 2016 |work=USA Today |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, it was reported that Trump had questioned the authenticity of the tape in multiple private conversations that year, including one with a Republican senator, even though he had already acknowledged that the voice was his, and apologized, after the tape was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/us/politics/trump-roy-moore-mcconnell-alabama-senate.html|title=Why Trump Stands by Roy Moore, Even as It Fractures His Party|author1=Jonathan Martin|author2=Maggie Haberman|author3=Alexander Burns|authorlink2=Maggie Haberman|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faulders |first1=Katherine |last2=Santucci |first2=John |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-privately-questioned-authenticity-access-hollywood-tape-sources/story?id=51396299|title=Trump has privately questioned authenticity of 'Access Hollywood' tape, sources say |date=November 26, 2017 |work=ABC News |accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Trump told a Republican senator that he wanted to investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women's genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/trump-access-hollywood-tape.html|title=Trump Once Said the 'Access Hollywood' Tape Was Real.

==Effects and aftermath==

===The Clinton–Trump debates===
The release of the tape led to a renewed anticipation towards the [[United States presidential debates, 2016#Second presidential debate (Washington University in St. Louis)|October 9 debate]] between Trump and Hillary Clinton, as it would be the first time for each candidate to directly address the controversy. Less than two hours before the debate began, Trump held a surprise press conference in [[St. Louis]] with [[Paula Jones]], [[Kathleen Willey]], and [[Juanita Broaddrick]], who have [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations|previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct]], and [[Kathy Shelton]], a rape victim whose rapist had been represented in the 1970s by Hillary, an appointed [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]]. Describing the conference as his "debate prep", Trump described the women as "courageous" and "victims of the Clintons", with each of the women repeating their grievances with the Clintons.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cheney |first1=Kyle |last2=Goldmacher |first2=Shane |title=Trump launches sneak attack ahead of debate |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-debate-hypocrites-republicans-229408?lo=ap_c1 |work=Politico |date=October 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference, Trump refused to answer journalists' questions about the ''Access Hollywood'' tape.&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt; Clinton's campaign dismissed the conference as "an act of desperation" and denounced Trump's "destructive race to the bottom".&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt; First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] said referring to the controversy, "It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Kelly | first=Amita | title=WATCH: Michelle Obama Says Trump Comments Have 'Shaken Me To My Core' | publisher=NPR | date=October 13, 2016 | url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/13/497817419/michelle-obama-trump-comments-have-shaken-me-to-my-core | accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate itself, [[debate moderator|co-moderator]] [[Anderson Cooper]] pressed Trump about whether the conversation on the tape meant that Trump had committed sexual assault. Trump said it "was locker room talk" and "I'm not proud of it," and said he wanted to move on to other things, but finally responded "I have not."&lt;ref name=DebateFact&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/10/09/497056227/fact-check-clinton-and-trump-debate-for-the-second-time Fact Check: Clinton and Trump debate for the second time], NPR (October 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that Trump had arranged for the women to sit in his family box and that they were to walk into the audience at the same time as Bill and confront him on live TV, but debate officials intervened and prevented the planned stunt from happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/10/trumps-debate-plan-to-seat-bill-clintons-accusers-in-family-box-was-thwarted/ |title=Trump wanted to put Bill Clinton's accusers in his family box.

===Response of athletes and coaches===
[[File:Trump Supporters Disgusted by Lewd Tape, But Still in His Corner.webm|thumb|right|250px|News report of voter reactions by [[Voice of America]].]]
Numerous professional athletes and coaches rejected Trump's claim that what he said on the tape was "locker room talk", saying that such comments were not normal or acceptable.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cydney Adams, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/professional-athletes-are-not-happy-about-donald-trump-locker-room-talk/ Professional athletes cry foul over Trump's "locker room talk"], CBS News (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Howard, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/not-lot-love-trump-s-locker-room-defense-n663706 Athletes and Coaches to Donald Trump: Sexual Assault Is Not 'Locker Room Talk'], NBC News (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Gregory, [http://time.com/4526039/donald-trump-locker-room-athletes/ Donald Trump Dismisses His 'Locker Room Talk' As Normal.

Eleven months after the footage was leaked, retired professional boxer [[Floyd Mayweather]] defended Trump's comments stating, "People don't like the truth ... He speak like a real man spoke." He added, "So he talking locker room talk. Locker room talk. 'I'm the man, you know what I'm saying? You know who I am. Yeah, I grabbed her by the p---y.

===Anti-Trump memes and campaigns===

The backlash from the comments prompted a "Pussy Grabs Back" [[hashtag]] urging women to vote against Trump on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]. Anti-Trump memes featuring cat imagery spread on social media. ''The Guardian'' wrote that an image of a snarling cat became a "rallying cry for female rage against Trump".&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Puglise, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-pussy-grabs-back-meme-women-twitter 'Pussy grabs back' becomes rallying cry for female rage against Trump], ''The Guardian'' (October 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/donald-trump-the-apprentice-1201887346/|title='Apprentice' Editor Says Trump Made Lewd Comments About Women Between Takes|first=Ted|last=Johnson|date=October 13, 2016|newspaper=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/tom-hanks-donald-trump-lewd-sexist-comments-offended-as-a-man-video-a7358246.html |title=Tom Hanks was asked if he was 'offended' by Donald Trump.

Trump's denial that he ever kissed or groped women without consent led to [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|more accusations]] by several women that Trump sexually assaulted them.&lt;ref&gt;Avila, Theresa.

In response to the recording, Shannon Coulter started a viral campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which urges individuals to [[boycott]] various companies that sell Trump related products.&lt;ref name=Boycott&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Kate|title=An anti-Trump movement is calling for the boycott of these 32 retailers|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-related-businesses-boycotted-2016-11?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T |publisher=Business Insider |date=November 15, 2016 |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various companies have since dropped Trump's products in response to the boycott, including [[Shoes.com]], [[Nordstrom]], [[Bergdorf Goodman]], and [[Neiman Marcus]].&lt;ref name=Boycott2&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGrath|first1=Maggie|title=A #GrabYourWallet Effect?

===Alleged other tapes===
On October 9, former staffers of Trump's reality show ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' and journalist [[Geraldo Rivera]] said that they both individually have more damaging tapes of Trump, but did not say if they would be released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelsey |last=Sutton |title=Geraldo Rivera: 'I have tapes' of 'embarrassing' statements from Trump |date=October 9, 2016 |publisher=[[Politico]] blogs |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/geraldo-rivera-i-have-tapes-of-embarrassing-statements-from-trump-229433 |accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Hadas|authorlink=Hadas Gold|last=Gold |title=David Brock: I will pay for 'Apprentice' tapes |date=October 9, 2016 |publisher=[[Politico]] blogs |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/david-brock-i-will-pay-for-apprentice-tapes-229432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera later stated that he had searched his files and that he could not find anything relevant to the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Brian |url=http://www.thewrap.com/geraldo-rivera-apologizes-to-donald-trump-doesnt-have-dirt-on-him-after-all/ |title=Geraldo Rivera Apologizes to Donald Trump, Doesn't Have Dirt on Him After All |date=October 12, 2016 |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the tape's release, Bill Pruitt, a producer of the first two seasons of the television series ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', claims there is recorded behind the scenes footage of Trump saying things that are "far worse". NBC's news division does not have access to the archives of the series. Another ''Apprentice'' producer, [[Chris Nee]], claimed on [[Twitter]] that Trump said "the N-word" in the archived footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=David|title=There's Allegedly "Apprentice" Footage of Donald Trump Saying the N-Word|url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/09/theres-allegedly-apprentice-footage-of-donald-trump-saying-the-n-word/ |work=Fortune |date=October 9, 2016 |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nword&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Adam|title=Days after Trump's lewd comments were revealed, the controversy rolls on|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-lewd-comments-2005-still-drawing-fire-n664221 |publisher=NBC News|date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nee later deleted the tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jane|first1=Talia|title=Tom Arnold says he has 'Apprentice' tapes of Trump saying "n*gger" and "retard"|url=https://mic.com/articles/160460/tom-arnold-says-he-has-apprentice-tapes-of-trump-saying-n-gger-and-retard |publisher=Mic |date=December 20, 2016 |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mcafee|first1=Tierney|title=Tom Arnold Claims He Has Apprentice Outtakes of Trump Saying the N-Word, the C-Word and Calling His Son a 'Retard'|url=http://people.com/politics/tom-arnold-apprentice-outtakes-trump-n-word-c-word-retard/ |publisher=People |date=December 20, 2016 |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[GoFundMe]] campaign was launched on October 9 with the goal of raising $5.1 million to release more tapes.

'''E!''' (originally an [[initialism]] of '''Entertainment Television''') is an American [[Cable television in the United States#Basic cable|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[cable channel|channel]] that is owned by the [[NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group]] division of [[NBCUniversal]], all owned by [[Comcast]].

As of January 2016, E! is available to 92.4 million households in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Movietime===
E! was originally launched on July 31, 1987, as '''Movietime''', a service that aired movie trailers, entertainment news, event and awards coverage, and interviews as an early example of a national [[barker channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DD173CF930A35755C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=|work=The New York Times|first= Jeremy|last=Gerard|title=TELEVISION; Fledgling Cable Networks Are Poised for Flight|date=June 3, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel was founded by [[Larry Namer]] and [[Alan Mruvka]].&lt;ref name="BOOK1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=The television industry: a historical dictionary|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |year=1991 |edition=illustrated|page=94|isbn=9780313256349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4EYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=alan-mruvka&amp;dq=alan-mruvka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/business/advertising-promoting-movies-via-cable.html|title=Advertising; Promoting Movies Via Cable|last=Dougherty |first=Philip H.|date=July 30, 1987|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Movietime hosts included [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Katie Wagner]], [[Julie Moran]], Suzanne Kay (daughter of [[Diahann Carroll]]), [[Mark DeCarlo]], [[Sam Rubin]] and [[Richard Blade]].

===E!===
[[File:E! Logo.svg|thumb|left|75px|E!'s logo from the launch under that branding. Used from June 1, 1990 until July 9, 2012 for the US flagship channel. Still in use for many of E!'s international networks.]]
Controlling ownership was originally held by a [[consortium]] of five cable television providers ([[Comcast]], [[Continental Cablevision]], [[Cox Communications|Cox Cable]], [[Tele-Communications Inc.|TCI]], and [[Warner Cable]]), [[HBO]]/[[Warner Communications]], and various founding shareholders, with HBO directly programming and managing the network. In 1989, after [[Time-Life]] bought Warner Communications to fend off a takeover bid by Paramount, the new [[Time Warner]] company held four of the eight major ownership positions and took over management control of Movietime and renamed the network as '''E!: Entertainment Television''' on June 1, 1990; this name change was made to emphasize its widening coverage of the [[celebrity–industrial complex]], contemporary film, television and music, daily Hollywood gossip, and fashion.

In 1997, Comcast, one of the minority partners, teamed up with [[Disney–ABC Television Group|Disney/ABC Cable Networks]] to buy the channel after Time-Warner had exercised their put agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19020738.html Comcast Corp. Gains Exclusive Right to Buy E! Entertainment], Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News (originated from ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''; via [[HighBeam Research]]), January 11, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast increased the ownership stakes in the network through mergers with forerunners of TCI and Continental under various circumstances. In November 2006, Comcast acquired Disney's 39.5% share of E! for $1.23 billion to gain full ownership of the network as part of a broader programming carriage agreement between Disney/ABC and Comcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=24|title= Comcast and the Walt Disney Company Announce Long-Term Comprehensive Distribution Agreements Securing Carriage for Disney Media Networks’ Products and Services|publisher=[[Comcast]]|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Comcast Entertainment Group, the company's television unit, became a division of the [[NBCUniversal Television Group]], after Comcast acquired a 51% majority stake in NBCUniversal from [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/183652/nbcuniversalcomcast_merger_what_we_do_and_dont_know.html NBC-Universal-Comcast Merger: What We Do and Don't Know], ''[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]]'', December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; E!'s only sister networks prior to the NBC Universal merger were the now-defunct channels Style Network (then [[Esquire Network]]) and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], along with Comcast's sports networks: Versus, [[Comcast SportsNet]] and [[Golf Channel]]. In the case of Versus, E! staff produced that network's ''[[Sports Soup]]'' and G4's ''[[Web Soup]]'', while the Orlando-based Golf Channel featured no crossovers with E! at all due to incompatible audiences and operations. Versus and Golf Channel were taken under the direct control of the [[NBC Sports]] division, with the former being renamed [[NBC Sports Network]] in January 2012, and are no longer connected to their former sister networks beyond advertising and in-house operations.

On July 9, 2012, the channel introduced a revised logo (the first change to its logo since the network rebranded as E! in 1990), removing the [[exclamation mark]] background behind the "E" but keeping the exclamation point underneath, along with a new slogan "Pop of Culture", which coincided with the launch of the new series ''[[Opening Act]]''. The network also started the process of introducing scripted programming (the first series, ''[[The Royals (TV series)|The Royals]]'', premiering in March 2015), in addition to its existing reality and documentary series. The changes were announced during E!'s programming upfront presentation on April 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/e-new-logo-pop-of-culture-tagline-318032 E! Unveils New Logo, 'Pop of Culture' Tagline], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{main|List of programs broadcast by E!}}

===News===
{{see also|E! News}}
E! is one of the few U.S. general-entertainment cable channels that broadcasts a daily news program; its flagship entertainment news program is ''[[E! News]]'', which debuted on September 1, 1991. The weekday program (which also has an hour-long weekend edition) features stories and gossip about celebrities, and the film, music and television industries, and has been broadcast under various formats since its launch, even being aired live for a time during the mid-2000s. It was first hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. Steve Kmetko was a host from 1994-2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It has been hosted by [[Terrence Jenkins]] and [[Giuliana Rancic]] since 2012 and 2006, respectively, with [[Ryan Seacrest]] (who co-anchored the program from 2006 to 2012) serving as [[managing editor]] of the news operation.

''E! News'' was the only entertainment news show on the channel for much of its history until 2006, when the channel launched ''[[The Daily 10]]'', hosted by [[Sal Masekela]] and [[Catt Sadler]] ([[Debbie Matenopoulos]] also co-hosted from the show's inception until 2008); the series was cancelled in September 2010 after E! announced that the weekday editions of ''E! News'' would be expanded to one hour starting on October 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/457412-E_Expands_Weeknight_Newscast_To_One_Hour.php E! Expands Weeknight Newscast To One Hour] 2011 NewBay Media September 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

E! also carried a [[simulcast]] of business news channel [[Bloomberg Television]] from 2004 to January 2009, when the latter network had expanded its cable and satellite carriage to a level that allowed the discontinuation of the simulcast. During its time on E!, the 5 to 8 a.m. block was the most watched period for the network, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Outside ''E! News'' telecasts, the channel runs an ''E! News''–branded ticker displaying entertainment news headlines each half-hour during regular programming (except during airings of ''E! News'' and ''The Soup'', and the channel's early morning infomercial block) which is updated daily; fast-breaking entertainment headlines (such as a celebrity arrest or death) may also be displayed on a ticker, during any program when warranted.

===Original series===
E! is known for its live red carpet pre-shows for the industry's three prominent award shows, the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and the [[Academy Awards]], and were famous for their fashion critiques by [[Joan Rivers]]; Rivers also hosted post-awards specials under the title ''[[Fashion Police]]'', which became a regular weekly series in September 2010. In April 2017, it was announced that E! had acquired the [[People's Choice Awards]], which will move to the network from [[CBS]] in 2018 with a new November scheduling. The network promoted that the show would be given an "end-to-end" experience that will leverage its existing experience in awards show coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/peoples-choice-awards-premiere-date-e-den-of-thieves-jesse-ignjatovic-evan-prager-1202226809/|title=People’s Choice Awards Sets Premiere Date For Inaugural Telecast On E!|last=Ramos|first=Dino-Ray|date=2017-12-14|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/peoples-choice-awards-cbs-e-1202063827/|title=People’s Choice Awards Moves From CBS To E!|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2017-04-06|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network also produces many documentary and biographical series, most notably ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''; many of E!'s original specials are entertainment-related ranging from light fare (such as ''25 Cutest Child Stars All Grown Up'') to serious fare (such as ''15 Most Unforgettable Hollywood Tragedies''). It also produces specials centering on investigative and crime stories including ''E! Investigates'', which features topical investigative reports on subjects ranging from [[child prostitution]] to [[teenage pregnancy]].

In recent years, the network has become known for its [[reality television]] programs. Its most popular series as of 2011 is ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'', which has spawned three [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] (''[[Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami]]'', ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take New York]]'', and ''[[Khloe and Lamar]]''). Other original programming airing on the network included weekly version of ''[[Fashion Police (TV series)|Fashion Police]]'' (which continues as post-awards ceremony specials).

E! has had three comedy programs: the late night talk show ''[[Chelsea Lately]]'', hosted by comedian [[Chelsea Handler]], its scripted/improvised spin-off ''[[After Lately]]'', and ''[[The Soup]]'' (based on the popular 1991-2002 E! series ''[[Talk Soup]]''), featuring clips of the previous week's TV shows with humorous commentary delivered by the host, actor/comedian [[Joel McHale]]. Handler also produced ''[[Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings|Love You, Mean It]]'', a weekly comedic look at pop culture hosted by [[Whitney Cummings]].

===Acquired series and films===
Over the years, E! has occasionally run acquired programming including reruns of ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'', ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' lifestyle-based interview shows from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (since removed under NBCUniversal ownership), and edited 60-minute versions of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', though fewer of these programs currently air.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marketingmag.ca/news/media-news/out-with-the-e-in-with-the-new-at-canwest-upfront-8989|title=Out with the E!, in with the new at Canwest upfront|work=[[Marketing (magazine)|Marketing Magazine]]|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only programming currently airing on E! that it does not produce are [[standards and practices|broadcast standards-edited]] reruns of the former [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' originally carried by HBO's sister network [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], and [[feature film]]s that air under the banner "Movies We Love"; the latter was part of a since-abandoned initiative by the network to use films to increase the network's ratings, though the branding remains, and low and mid-grossing female focused films from the [[Universal Pictures]] library usually receive their basic cable premiere on E!, with higher-grossing films premiering on [[USA Network]]. The network has aired same-week runs of NBC series (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'', ''[[Fashion Star]]'', ''[[Whitney (TV series)|Whitney]]'', and ''[[Are You There, Chelsea?]]''), and in the past aired previews of G4 programming to give that network an extended promotional platform due to their lowered carriage when it was removed from [[DirecTV]] in November 2010.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==E! HD==
'''E! HD''' is a [[High-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed of E! that launched on December 8, 2008; like the rest of E!'s sister lifestyle and sports networks owned by former parent [[Comcast Entertainment Group]] and subsequently the NBC cable networks, the feed broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format. Currently, filmed program content and all of the network's post-2010 programs, along with limited pre-2010 content is carried in the format, with HD programming airing in a [[letterbox]] format on the SD channel (some films remain in [[480i]] due to contractual or technical reasons). The HD feed is available on most cable and telco providers, along with both satellite services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During E!'s run as a broadcast service in Canada, the ''E! Ontario'' version of the service until the December 2008 discontinuation of the E! broadcast television system was available in HD over [[Hamilton, Ontario]]-based [[CHCH-TV]] (channel 11) on its channel 18 digital signal, though the majority of E!'s programming outside American primetime series before the shutdown of the [[television system]] was not available in the format.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==''E! Online''==
''E! Online'' is the online arm of E!, featuring live updates on entertainment news stories; the website includes an online-only entertainment news bulletin titled ''E! News Now'', which is updated each weekday. The website also provides live streaming video of major red carpet events including movie premieres and award shows such as the Academy Awards and the Emmys, along with some blogs involving shows such as ''The Soup''. Columnists featured on the website include [[Kristin dos Santos]] (the "Watch with Kristin" television blog), [[Ted Casablanca]] ("The Awful Truth" gossip blog), and Marc Malkin (writer of an eponymous gossip blog and host of a daily video blog on the site).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As part of the rebrand of the cable channel on July 9, 2012, EOnline.com was redesigned for [[HTML5]], including tablet and mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/01/e-emphasizes-social-presence-and-tablet-friendliness-at-upfront/ E! emphasizes social presence and tablet friendliness at upfront], ''The Lost Remote'', May 1, 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504054452/http://www.lostremote.com/2012/05/01/e-emphasizes-social-presence-and-tablet-friendliness-at-upfront/ |date=May 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International versions==
{{Missing information|section|other International versions|date=August 2012}}

===Australia===
{{main|E! (Australia)}}

===Canada===
Unlike most international cable channels that have licensed an American cable channel's branding and programming, E! has existed as two separate television channels in Canada – in both broadcast and pay television forms.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On September 7, 2007, [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]] rebranded its CH television system as [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] CH originally launched on February 12, 2001 by [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]]/[[Hamilton, Ontario]] as a secondary service of the [[Global Television Network]]; the CH/E! system would later include four additional Canwest-owned stations in [[Quebec]] ([[CJNT-DT|CJNT]]/[[Montreal]]), [[British Columbia]] ([[CHEK-DT|CHEK]]/[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and [[CHBC-TV|CHBC]]/[[Kelowna]]) and [[Alberta]] ([[CHCA-TV|CHCA]]/[[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]]), and three affiliates owned by [[Jim Pattison Group]] in British Columbia ([[CKPG-TV|CKPG]]/[[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] and [[CFJC-TV|CFJC]]/[[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]) and Alberta ([[CHAT-TV|CHAT]]/[[Medicine Hat, Alberta|Medicine Hat]]). The E! television system shut down on September 1, 2009 due to low ratings and corporate financial difficulties that eventually led to Canwest filing for [[bankruptcy protection]] and selling its properties to [[Shaw Media]] for $6.7 million USD; the E! [[owned-and-operated station]]s experienced varied fates (CHCH and CJNT were sold to [[Channel Zero (company)|Channel Zero]], CHEK was sold to an employee-led group; CHBC remained with Canwest and was converted into a Global O&amp;O, and CHCA ceased operations outright), while the Pattison Group stations affiliated with the [[Rogers Media]]-owned [[Citytv]] system.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As E!, local news and other regional programming, as well as most local community sponsorships on the O&amp;O stations, used local branding (incorporating the callsign branding scheme common with Canadian stations not owned by a network or television system).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This decision was at least partly made to avoid confusion with ''E! News'', but likely intended to ensure that local newscasts were not perceived as celebrity-oriented.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The E! brand would later return to Canada on November 1, 2010, when [[CTVglobemedia]] (whose assets are now owned by [[Bell Media]]) signed a multi-year/multi-platform agreement with Comcast to rebrand [[Category A services|Category 2]] [[specialty channel]] Star! (which had a similar format to E! U.S. and had carried some of its programming prior to the 2007 rebranding of CH) into a [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Canadian version of E!]] on November 29, 2010.

E! is broadcast in [[Israel]] by cable provider [[HOT (Israel)|HOT]] and by satellite provider [[yes (Israel)|yes]].

====Philippines====
E! Philippines was launched in mid-1997 over-the-air in [[Metro Manila]] on [[DWKC-TV]] (channel 31), sharing the channel with Cinema Television. In 2000, CTV-31 Manila leased DWKC's entire broadcast day, and branded the channel as E! Philippines. It was originally broadcast 24 hours a day, but eventually reduced in 2001 to a primetime 6-midnight block, before ending in 2003. Some of E!'s programs were brought to the Philippines and remade in a local version, one of which was ''Wild On! Philippines''.&lt;ref name="RMN Joint Venture For E! Philippines"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanzi|first=Sol Jose|title=RMN Joint Venture for E!

Three years after the relaunch as a standalone cable channel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pep.ph/photos/2403/the-launch-of-e-entertainment-television-in-the-philippines The launch of E! Entertainment Television in the Philippines] PEP.ph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30316">'''Fictional portrayals of psychopaths''', or '''sociopaths''', are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of [[psychopathy]], which is itself used with varying definitions by [[mental health professional]]s, [[criminologist]]s and others. The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or [[critic]]s based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.

Such characters are often portrayed in an [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] fashion and typically in the role of a [[villain]] or [[antihero]], where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions and criteria in the [[history of psychopathy]] have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several [[stereotypical]] images of psychopathy in both [[Layperson|lay]] and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming [[con artist]], the deranged [[serial killer]], the successful [[Psychopathy in the workplace|corporate psychopath]], or the chronic low-level [[crime|offender]] with [[juvenile delinquency]]. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical [[bogeyman]], fascination with human [[evil]], and sometimes perhaps [[envy]] of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anguish]] or [[Emotional security|insecurity]].&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skeem|first=J.

==Early depictions==
In the 19th century the diagnostic categories of [[monomania]] or [[moral insanity]] (the word 'moral' then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature, covering numerous eccentricities, obsessions or breakdowns—and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality, occasionally violent. This period also saw the rise of [[crime fiction]] such as [[sensation novels]], where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane, and [[detective novels]], playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities.&lt;ref name=Thesing&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to the Victorian novel |author=Patrick Brantlinger, William B.

Nevertheless, an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder, contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty. 'Psychopaths' began to appear in [[vaudeville]]s, ditties (songs) and press articles. The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free, a usage still quoted in dictionaries today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011: Psychopath: 1885 Pall Mall G. 21 Jan.

[[Degeneration|'Degenerates']] were also depicted in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways to the modern usages of the concept of psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis to justify eradicating their opposition.&lt;ref name=Jalava&gt;[http://summit.sfu.ca/item/8120 Science of conscience: Metaphysics, morality, and rhetoric in psychopathy research] Jarkko Jalava, 2007, PhD at Simon Fraser University, then Professor at Okanagan College, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
The meaning gradually narrowed, initially as 'psychopathic inferiors' covering all of what today might be called [[personality disorders]] and various other conditions, then intertwining with the terminology of the 'sociopath' (and eventually [[antisocial personality disorder]]), though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways.

Early representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic, unpredictable, sexually depraved, and emotionally unstable ([[mania|manic]]) characters with a compulsion to engage in random violence and destruction, usually with a series of bizarre mannerisms such as giggling, laughing, or facial [[tics]]. Up until the late 1950s, cinematic conventions usually relegated the psychopath to roles of genre villains such as gangsters, [[mad scientists]], [[supervillains]], and many types of generic criminals. Examples of this type are [[Pinkie Brown]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]) in ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'', Tommy Udo ([[Richard Widmark]]) in ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', Cody Jarrett ([[James Cagney]]) in ''[[White Heat (film)|White Heat]]'', and [[Tony Camonte|Antonio 'Tony' Camonte]] ([[Paul Muni]]) in the 1932 version of ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. [[Homosexuals]] were also referred to as psychopaths under the broad definition then in use; the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 1952 would list it under 'sociopathic personality disturbance'.

One exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert ([[Peter Lorre]]) in the 1931 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Lorre portrays Beckert as an outwardly unremarkable man tormented by a compulsion to ritualistically murder children. A German film (allegedly based on the real life [[serial killer]] [[Peter Kürten]]), it was released in America in 1933 and has been seen as indicative of a turning point in American media depictions of psychopaths. Until the 1930s psychiatrists typically applied the diagnosis to unemployed males or 'hypersexual' women, but several psychiatric, cultural and economic trends, together with [[sex crime]] panics, converged to transform the popular psychopath into a violent, male, sexual deviant or criminal—a threat to innocence, [[gender role]]s and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1908506?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102561687811 "Uncontrolled Desires": The Response to the Sexual Psychopath, 1920-1960] Estelle B.

Also reproduced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=5jTjfFo42E8C Passion and Power: Sexuality in History (from Pg 199)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ostap Bender]] character from novels [[The Twelve Chairs]] and [[The Little Golden Calf]] by Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]] is also considered a portrait of a charming psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b17.ru/blog/11662/ Be cautious - socially adapted psychopath, damned attractive man]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tanja-tank.livejournal.com/34480.html sociopaths and narcissists in movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennie Small from [[Of Mice and Men]], who is mentally retarded, has been described as also lacking a conscience or moral sense, a common definition of a [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/o/of-mice-and-men/character-analysis/lennie-small&lt;/ref&gt; His inability to stay out of trouble is often attributed to this.

==Mid 20th century==
One of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of [[Ed Gein]], arrested in 1957. A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death, he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local [[cemetery]], making various items out of their skin. Rumours spread that he was also a [[necrophiliac]], [[cannibal]] or [[transvestite]], though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to [[leading questions]] by interrogators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_ZDUR7H_QMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Deviant] Harold Schechter, 1998, Pg 192, 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertcdaniels.com/ed_gein.htm#_ftn2 Ed Gein: the Cannibal Myth Exposed]&lt;/ref&gt; Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial, deemed to have had [[schizophrenia]] (psychosis including [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]) for at least 12 years, though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a 'sexual psychopath'.&lt;ref&gt;Gonyea, Floyd.

January 7, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bloch]], a prolific pulp horror author, says his 1959 novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' was based on the Gein murders and the idea of an apparently sane person in a local community committing heinous crimes, but not necessarily on Gein himself, despite numerous similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediageeknetwork.com/psycho-exclusive-an-interview-with-author-robert-bloch/ PSYCHO EXCLUSIVE: An Interview With Author Robert Bloch] By Ed Gross, Media Geek Network, November 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The villain, [[Norman Bates]], is portrayed as an outwardly unremarkable man who murders a woman while under the control of an [[disassociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] that takes the form of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his domineering mother]], who he himself murdered. Both the novel and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]] were influences on the popular media portrayal of psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin-readers.com/pdf/downloads/pr/teachers-notes/9781405879286.pdf Teacher's Notes: Psycho] Penguin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/EdGein.html Ed Gein and the figure of the transgendered serial killer] by K.E. Sullivan. from Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, no. 43, July 2000, pp. 38-47&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the book nor film elaborates on the term 'psycho', though it is commonly taken to refer to either psychotic or psychopath. At the end of the film, a psychiatrist describes Bates as having a split personality. [[Multiple personality disorder]] was at that time very popular (cf 1957 movie ''[[The Three Faces of Eve]]'') and is to this day commonly confused with [[schizophrenia]]. Bloch later wrote a script for the 1966 film ''[[The Psychopath]]'', the original working title for which was "Schizo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Psychopath_1966 The Psychopath – 1966: Plot Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters. The title of the 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', starring [[James Dean]], came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the [[hypnosis|hypno]]-[[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] of a diagnosed psychopath. In the book, psychiatrist [[Robert M. Lindner]] also discussed psychopaths in general as pointlessly selfish individuals who appear unable to accept society's rules. In [[Ken Kesey]]'s 1962 novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Randle McMurphy]], after being admitted to a mental institution, is repeatedly referred to by the authorities, other patients and himself as a possible or definite psychopath. He reads from his record: "repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath", and adds that a doctor told him it means "I fight and fuh-pardon me, ladies-means I am he put it overzealous in my sexual relations." The current doctor then reads out the note: "Don't overlook the possibility that this man might be feigning psychosis".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/one-flew-over-cuckoos-nest/madness-quotes.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the script for the popular [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film adaptation]] in 1975, only the latter is retained and the term psychopath is never used. Ironically, the main authority figure in the hospital—the cold, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Nurse Ratched]]—was later described as a psychopath under later understandings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LBIjsk-2ok4C The Psychopath in Film] 1999 By Wayne Wilson. Pg 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20th century==
The 1973 film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' involved two lead characters based loosely on  [[Charles Starkweather]] and [[Caril Ann Fugate]]. While the male lead Kit ([[Martin Sheen]]) is sometimes described as a psychopath or sociopath, psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]], a leading proponent of the assessment of psychopathy, has identified Holly ([[Sissy Spacek]]) as exemplifying his concept of a psychopath due to her poor emotional sense of the meaning of events and her attempted mask of normality. However, writer and director [[Terrence Malick]] has said he considered Kit's shallow, bitter insensitivity to be a result of suffering and neglect growing up in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and 15-year-old Holly, though immature and mis-estimating her audience, to be a quite typical [[Southern United States|Southern]] girl wanting to help narrate and come off well but still give the hard facts, and not dwell on herself or on personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfIEVtzj52YC Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us] Robert D.

The increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century, fueled by cases such as [[John Wayne Gacy]] (1978), [[Ted Bundy]] (1978) and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] (1991), lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature, sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late-19th century literature with the high-functioning behaviors detected in some serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc3228/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf Serial Killing Myths Versus Reality: A Content Analysis of Serial Killer Movies Made Between 1980 and 2001] Sarah Scott McCready, Masters Thesis, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1995.1801_87.x | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Consuming Cannibals: Psychopathic Killers as Archetypes and Cultural Icons | year=1995 | journal=The Journal of American Culture | pages=87–96 | last1 = Grixti | first1 = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrist and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]], most notably portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the [[Academy Award]]-winning 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', is perhaps the most infamous fictional psychopath of the 20th century. Lecter is intelligent and sophisticated (whereas psychopathy is generally associated with lower than average verbal [[intelligence]]&lt;ref name="LecterIntelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeLisi|first=Matt|author2=Vaughn, Michael G.|author3=Beaver, Kevin M.|author4=Wright, John Paul|title=The Hannibal Lecter Myth: Psychopathy and Verbal Intelligence in the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=32|issue=2|pages=169–177|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9147-z|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/staff/delisi/Hannibal%20Lecter%20PDF.pdf|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and his disarming charisma and wit disguise his true nature as a serial killer. He spends most of the film in a cell, taunting [[Clarice Starling]] with clues to the identity of another serial killer, [[Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)|Buffalo Bill]], in exchange for intimate details of Starling's troubled childhood. Lecter first appeared in [[Thomas Harris]]'  1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', in which he is characterized as not fitting any known psychological profile. In the film adaptation of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', he is referred to as a "pure psychopath".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' and its first film adaptation, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', FBI profiler [[Will Graham (fictional character)|Will Graham]] suggests that psychologists "say he's a sociopath" because they "don't know what else to call him". Shortly afterwards in ''Red Dragon'', Lecter's jailer [[Frederick Chilton]] says "...we thought he might provide us with a singular opportunity to study a pure sociopath...As it turned out, I don't think we're any closer to understanding him now than the day he came in." In the script for the film version of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', the same character calls Lecter a "pure psychopath". In the novel of the same name, FBI agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] tells Starling "I'm waist-deep in inaccessible patient evaluations of Dr. Lecter and they're all different" and Chilton later tells Starling "A pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too sophisticated for the standard tests."&lt;/ref&gt; In the later novels ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'' and ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', Lecter's psychopathy is portrayed as the result of seeing his sister Mischa murdered and cannibalized during [[World War II]]. In 2013 Harris revealed that he originally based the Lecter character on Alfredo Ballí Trevino, a Mexican physician who had killed and dismembered his [[homosexual]] lover, in what was called a [[crime of passion]] over a financial dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/495908/20130731/hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-ball.htm Real Hannibal Lecter was Murderous Gay Mexican Doctor Alfredo Ballí Treviño] Umberto Bacchi, IB Times, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latintimes.com/articles/6867/20130730/real-hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-balli-trevino-inspiration-thomas-harris-silence-lambs-25-anniversary.htm Who Was The Real Hannibal Lecter?] Valdez, Latin Times, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[American Psycho]]'' tells the story of [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[yuppie]] serial killer working on [[Wall Street]] in the 1980s. It was made into a [[American Psycho (film)|film]] in 2000. Author [[Bret Easton Ellis]] has told interviewers that the book is a satire on shallow [[consumerist]] lifestyles, but also that the writing of the violent scenes was based on fictional horror and FBI material on serial killers, along with how he imagined "a psychotic who worked on Wall Street" would describe such incidents. Some commentary, including in scientific journals, has suggested the Bateman character appears to be a psychopath. However, Bateman also exhibits signs of psychosis such as hallucinations, and as such appears to be an [[unreliable narrator]]; it is left ambiguous whether Bateman is actually a serial killer, or is merely hallucinating about committing murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis Bret Easton Ellis, The Art of Fiction]  No. 216.

In the 1993 book ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' and its 1999 [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film adaptation]], the character of Lisa (played by [[Angelina Jolie]] in the film) is a rebellious, antisocial young woman who is diagnosed as a sociopath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.cengage.com/psychology/resources/students/screen/screen_20000110.html Girl, Interrupted—Cuckoo's Nest Redux] By Elaine Cassel, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is left ambiguous whether that diagnosis is accurate.

The 1996 film ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' depicts a suspected murderer who appears to suffer from [[multiple personality disorder]], who at the end reveals that he has been faking the disorder. In the original novel by [[William Diehl]], the psychiatrist Molly Arrington and others repeatedly explain psychopathy and psychosis as if they are the same, inherently antisocial, condition.

''[[Harry Potter]]'' author [[J. K. Rowling]] has described [[Lord Voldemort]], the series' main villain, as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0900-ew-jensen.htm|author=Jensen, Jeff. |title='Fire' Storm |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Numerous characters in television shows are informally described as psychopaths by the [[actors]] who play the parts. Examples include [[Natalie Buxton]] in ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badgirls.co.uk/library/int-s6-db.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Slater]] and [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] in ''[[EastEnders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bettingpress.com/category/Entertainment/Who-killed-Archie-Mitchell-update--Sean-Slater-now-favourite-in-Eastenders-betting-201002160062/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a373916/eastenders-michael-moon-is-a-psychopath-says-steve-john-shepherd.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dexter Morgan]] in the American show ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://darklydexter.com/articles/michael-c-hall-and-kevin-dutton-discuss-about-psychopathy/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jodie-comer-meet-killing-eves-pink-dressed-psychopathic-breakout-star-w520872&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] from the British TV soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'', is also known for having a serious personality disorder. His character is famous for presenting several tendencies of a sociopathic personality including, manipulation, lying, and aggression. He has served time in prison and often blames his mother for his traumatic childhood,  His character has matured over the years however, the mask tends to slip from time to time and he returns to his darker side, most recently when he helped hide a dead body with a terrifying, cold-hearted attitude.

[[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]], the title character in the FOX medical-thriller ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' is referred to as a sociopath multiple times by several characters throughout the course of the show.

[[Sherlock Holmes]], the lead character in the BBC series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', is referred to as a psychopath multiple times throughout the course of the show; in response to these claims, Holmes describes himself as a "high-functioning sociopath". He has also been described as having [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06diagnosis-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetclaire.org/quotes/sherlock/series-two/the-hounds-of-baskerville/ |title=Sherlock "The Hounds of Baskerville" (Episode 2.2) &amp;#124; Planet Claire Quotes |publisher=Planetclaire.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]] novel ''[[I Am Not a Serial Killer]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Mr. Monster]]'' and ''[[I Don't Want To Kill You]]'', are narrated by John Wayne Cleaver, a teenaged diagnosed sociopath who lives by a rigid code of behavior in order to avoid becoming a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/ Author's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Chicago academic has argued in a review of TV trends that the contemporary fantasy of sociopathy/psychopathy is of someone whose emotional disconnection from others in society, rather than being the hindrance that it can represent in real clinical cases, enables them to be an amazingly successful manipulator due to a breakdown in the [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewinquiry.com/features/why-we-love-sociopaths/ Why We Love Sociopaths].

Contemporary advice on writing psychopathic/sociopathic characters suggests that lack of a conscience and lack of empathy are always the chief characteristics, along with an ability to fool others, while the type of selfish antisocial behavior, and any secondary characteristics, can vary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5fPEQl7I5H0C&amp; Bullies, Bastards And Bitches: How To Write The Bad Guys Of Fiction].

In 2013, the video console game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was released with numerous references to psychopaths and sociopaths, including reports from a fictional psychiatrist. One of the lead characters, Trevor, is described both psychopathic and psychotic; the voice actor who played the part says he based his performance on [[Tom Hardy]]'s portrayal of [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]] in the film ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/an-interview-with-steven-ogg-the-voice-of-gta-vs-trevor An Interview With Steven Ogg, The Voice Of "GTA V’s" Trevor].

'''Fitts for Fight''' was a female duo consisting of Ellinor Aurora Aasgaard and Julie Ilona Balas from [[Kristiansand]] in Norway. They became known when it was revealed that the songs they claimed to have written themselves were made by [[demoscene]] musicians and downloaded from micromusic.net, while the two women added their own often explicit lyrics to the music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www11.nrk.no/urort/article.aspx?articleId=5820022 NRK: Ikke stjel andres låter!]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213215821/http://www11.nrk.no/urort/article.aspx?articleId=5820022 |date=13 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to micromusic.net they have so far identified songs from 505 of YM Rockerz, Binärpilot, [[8 Bit Weapon]], [[Arachno]], Printed Circuit, Yerzmyey, [[Drx]] of [[Bodenständig 2000]], [[Jo Petrole]] and [[Stu Drop da Bomb|Stu]] of [[Drop da Bomb]]. After it was made public that they had copied the songs, Fitts for Fight deleted the music from their page on [[MySpace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vorc.org/en/20061219014954 VORC: Fitts For Fight stealing chip music]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105152332/http://www.vorc.org/en/20061219014954 |date=5 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were removed from [[Urørt]].

The songs are originally in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and are getting millions of downloads on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epoca.globo.com/vida/vida-util/carreira/noticia/2013/10/como-os-criadores-da-bgalinha-pintadinhab-ficaram-milionarios.html|title=Como os criadores da Galinha Pintadinha ficaram milionários|last=Coronato|first=Marcos|author2=Ciscati, Rafael|date=4 October 2013|work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the songs have been already translated into Spanish and English.

==History==
The songs revolve around the title character Galinha Pintadinha, a [[cartoon]] chicken and their friends from [[nursery rhyme]]s, in animated music videos made in [[flash animation]]. They were phenomena in DVD sales during the early 2010s to be released and publicized nationally by [[Som Livre]] becoming well known among children with clowns [[Patati Patatá]].
Also released several products based on the characters as toys, books and apps for smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galinhapintadinha.com.br/loja/produtos.html |title=Store |accessdate=26 June 2012 |author=Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708232047/http://www.galinhapintadinha.com.br/loja/produtos.html |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to [[Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos]], the second DVD was the 6th biggest selling in 2010 DVD and 17th best-selling in 2011 in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Downloads"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abpd.org.br/downloads/Fina2011.pdf/ |title=Mercado Brasileiro de Música 2011 |publisher=''[[Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos|ABPD]]'' |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014073225/http://abpd.org.br/downloads/Fina2011.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the animated music videos premiered on [[Netflix]] in several countries including in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and Spanish Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/internet/2015/07/galinha-pintadinha-chega-ao-netflix-dos-estados-unidos-e-de-paises-de-lingua-espanhola.shtml |title=Galinha Pintadinha estreia na Netflix dos Estados Unidos e de países de língua espanhola |accessdate=11 September 2015|author=Info Abril}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 his studio occupied the 89th position as one of the 150 biggest licensed brands in the world, ranking published by the British magazine ''License! Global''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-1?page=0,11&lt;/ref&gt;
==Media==
Since the release of their second album the character had a pretty big growth in children's media in Brazil. Many toys, backpacks, CDs, books and supplies for babies have been launched over the years. The characters also have achieved media for Smartphones with music applications and interactive games such as ''PoChickenPo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/tudo-sobre/galinha-pintadinha-no-android.html|title=Galinha Pintadinha no Android| publisher=Techtudo|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Grand Master of Magic® Award''' is a lifetime achievement award presented by the Brotherhood of Auckland Magicians Incorporated on behalf of the magicians of New Zealand.  It was first awarded in 1969 and to date it has been awarded on eighteen occasions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bam.net.nz/grand-masters-of-magic/|title=Brotherhood of Auckland Magicians : Grand Master of Magic Award information}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibmring160"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibmring160.com/national-awards/grand-masters.aspx|title=Grand Master of Magic criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Edgar_Benyon|title=Benyon Biography, MagicPedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria for the Grand Master of Magic® ==

The criteria for the Grand Master of Magic Award was formalised in 1998 and is as follows :

"Its purpose is to honour those magicians who are acknowledged by their fellow magicians to be masters of the art and craft of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].  The recipients first and foremost must be [[performers]] of a high standard.  In addition they might be originators of [[magic tricks|magical effects]], or administrators giving time and expertise to running societies and [[magic convention|conventions]].  They could be consistent competition winners, or have an international standing, or be known only in the [[New Zealand]] setting.  But above all they are people who have served magic well, have graced our art, and made a special contribution over many years."

Any nomination must also be measured against the standard achieved by the previous recipients.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibmring160" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11451">__NOTOC__
The '''grotesque body''' is a concept, or [[literary trope]], put forward by Russian [[literary critic]] [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] in his study of [[François Rabelais]]' work. The essential principle of grotesque realism is degradation, the lowering of all that is abstract, spiritual, noble, and ideal to the material level. Through the use of the grotesque body in his novels, Rabelais related political conflicts to human [[anatomy]]. In this way, Rabelais used the concept as "a figure of unruly biological and social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perforations: Grotesque Corpus |url=http://www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf3/grotesque_corpus.html |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by means of this information that Bakhtin pinpoints two important [[subtext]]s: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]), and the second is ''grotesque realism'' (grotesque body). Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Katerina and Michael Holquist 297-299, ''Mikhail Bakhtin''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carnival ==
[[File:GreatSouthCarnivalMaskers.jpg|thumb|321x321px|Grotesque masks are shown here, worn by many at a carnival.]]
The [[Carnival]] is known as the feast of fools. In today's world, this is better known as [[Mardi Gras]]. Mardi Gras is a religious celebration where people consume copious amounts of food and wine and have a large party to celebrate. The grotesqueness in the carnival is seen as the abundance and large amount of food consumed by the body. There is much emphasis put on the mouth  (where the body can be entered). Eating, drinking, burping from excess, etc. is all done through the mouth. Rabelais uses the Carnival to refer to politics and critique the world based on human anatomy.

In the Italian celebration of Carnival, masks play a major role as many people wear them during the celebration. Many of these masks can be seen as an exaggeration of the grotesque as they feature enlarged facial elements such as an enlarged nose (which is a part of the grotesque body). The Italian celebration of carnival is similar to that of Mardi Gras where food and alcohol are consumed in excess.

Both renditions of Carnival are celebrated immediately before the Christian season of [[Lent]] which is about a 40-day season for people of Christian (primarily Catholic) faith to cleanse themselves and become pure before [[Easter]] Sunday.

Exaggeration, hyperbole, and expressiveness are all key elements of the grotesque style. Certain aspects of the body are referenced when talking about the grotesque. These things include elements of the body that either protrude from the body or a part of the body that can be entered. This is because the body in many cases is seen as pure where as the outside world is not. Therefore, parts of the body that allow the outside world in or allow elements inside the body out, are seen and used as an exaggeration of the grotesque. In the article, "Absurdity and Hidden Truth: Cunning Intelligence and Grotesque Body Images as Manifestations of the Trickster", Koepping refers back to Bakhtin's statement, "The themes of cursing and of laughter are almost exclusively a subject of the grotesqueness of the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor = 1062254|title = History of Religions, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Feb., 1985), pp. 191-214|date = Feb 1985|publisher = University of Chicago Press|last = Koepping|first = Klaus-Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Small grotesque scoffing.JPG|thumb|255x255px|The grotesque is used here through the use of the mouth in the architecture of a building.]]
Italian satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] explained: "[[satire]] exhibits the grotesque body, which is dominated by the [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|primary needs]] (eating, drinking, defecating, urinating, sex) to celebrate the victory of life: the social and the [[Corporeality|corporeal]] are joyfully joint in something indivisible, universal and beneficial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Se Dio avesse voluto che credessimo in lui, sarebbe esistito (in Italian) |url= http://www.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/276|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin explained how the grotesque body is a celebration of the cycle of life: the grotesque body is a comic figure of profound ambivalence: its positive meaning is linked to birth and renewal and its negative meaning is linked to death and decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazen Brides Grotesque Daughters Treacherous Mothers by Felicity Collins (Bakhtin, 308-317) |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/23/women_funny_oz/ |accessdate=2008-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042917/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/02/23/women_funny_oz.html |archivedate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rabelais' epoch (1500–1800) "it was appropriate to ridicule the [[king]] and [[clergy]], to use dung and [[urine]] to [[wikt:degradation|degrade]]; this was not to just [[Insult|mock]], it was to unleash what Bakhtin saw as the people’s power, to renew and regenerate the entire [[social system]]. It was the power of the people’s festive-carnival, a way to turn the official spectacle inside-out and upside down, just for a while; long enough to make an impression on the participating official stratum. With the advent of modernity (science, technology, [[industrial revolution]]), the mechanistic overtook the organic, and the officialdom no longer came to join in festive-carnival. The bodily lower stratum of humor dualized from the upper stratum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boje | first = David M. |date=March 2004 | title = Grotesque Method | journal = Proceedings of First International Co-sponsored Conference, Research methods Division, Academy of Management: Crossing Frontiers in Quantitative and Qualitative Research methods. | volume = 2 | pages = 1085–1114 | url = http://peaceaware.com/McD/papers/Lyon%20proceedings%20Boje%202994%20Grotesque%20Method%20.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early uses of grotesque ==
Before people began to develop literature or art, leaders would sit in their halls surrounded by their warriors amusing themselves by mocking their opponents and enemies. The warriors would laugh at any weakness or defect, either physical or mental, giving nicknames which exaggerated these traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art|last = Wright|first = Thomas|publisher = Virtue Brothers &amp; CO.|year = 1865|isbn = |location = London|pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon warriors sought to give a more permanent form to their ridicule, which led to rude depictions on bare rocks, or any other surface that was convenient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the Medieval Grotesque Carnival, emphasis is put on the nether regions of the body as the center and creation of meaning. The spirit rather than coming from above comes from the belly, buttocks, and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Lübker, Henrik. "The Method of In-between in the Grotesque and the Works of Leif Lage." Continent. N.p., Mar. 2012. Web. 22 Oct. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |title=Iran denies troop attack links |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513220441/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference...  During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"]. Retrieved September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/immigrationdebate/ci_24598028/obama-san-francisco-calls-immigration-reform|title=Obama’s immigration speech in deep-blue San Francisco interrupted by anti-deportation hecklers|author=|date=25 November 2013|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/heckler-obama-steals-attention-presidents-speech-21008837|title=Video: Heckler Disrupts Obama's Speech With Minute-Long Rant|first=ABC|last=News|date=|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126145922/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/|title=Obama addresses heckler during speech on immigration|author=|date=|website=daytondailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144614/http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|upright|Samuel Clemens, American humorist who wrote under the pen name [[Mark Twain]]]]
A '''humorist''' is an [[intellectual]] who uses [[humor]] in writing or public speaking. Humorists are distinct from [[comedian]]s, who are [[show business]] entertainers whose business is to make an audience laugh, though some persons have occupied both roles in the course of their careers.

==The iconic humorist==
[[Mark Twain]], pen name of Samuel Langhorn Clemens (1835–1910) was called the "greatest humorist this country has produced" in his ''New York Times'' obituary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0421.html |title=Obituary (New York Times) |accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Faulkner]] called him "the father of [[American literature]]".&lt;ref name="faulkner"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jelliffe |first=Robert A. |title=Faulkner at Nagano |year=1956 |publisher=Kenkyusha, Ltd |location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States national cultural center, the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], has chosen to award a [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] annually since 1998 to individuals who have "had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain".&lt;ref name="kennedy-center1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/marktwain/ |title=The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |publisher=Kennedy-center.org |accessdate =2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from a comedian==
[[Humor]] is the quality which makes experiences provoke laughter or amusement, while [[comedy]] is a [[performing art]]. The nineteenth century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] lamented the misuse of ''humor'' (a German [[loanword]] from English) to mean any type of comedy. A humorist is adept at seeing the humor in a situation or aspect of life and relating it, usually through a story; the [[comedian]], on the other hand, concentrates on jokes designed to invoke instantaneous laughter. The humorist is primarily a writer of books, newspaper or magazine articles or [[columnist|columns]], [[play (theatre)|stage]] or [[screenplay|screen]] plays, and may occasionally appear before an audience to deliver a lecture or read a piece of his or her work. The comedian always performs his or her work for an audience, either in live performance, audio recording, radio, television, or film.&lt;ref name=SC&gt;{{cite web|last=Study.com|title=Humorist vs Comedian: What is the Difference?|url=https://study.com/articles/humorist_vs_comedian_what_is_the_difference.html|website=Study.com|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Study.com'', a humorist job requires a bachelor's degree, and according to US Bureau of Labor statistics, earns a 2016 median salary of US$29.44. This is compared to the comedian, which requires a high school diploma and earns a median salary of $17.34.&lt;ref name=SC/&gt;

[[Phil Austin]], of the comedy group [[the Firesign Theatre]], expressed his thoughts about the difference in 1993 liner notes to the ''[[Fighting Clowns]]'' allbum:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Fighting Clowns |title-link= |year=1993 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |access-date=February 9, 2018 |first=Phil |last=Austin |author-link=Phil Austin |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=''Clowns'' was the key word because clowning was what I thought had become our collective fate. I had once entertained higher ambitions for us, needless to say, although clowning is certainly a wonderful thing, unless you are a clown in which case it's a job.&lt;br&gt;
To me, there is a great difference between a humorist and a clown, and I had hoped that life for the Firesign Theatre would have led more toward the world of Mark Twain than the world of Beepo. The humorist is a happy soul; he comments from the sidelines of life, safe behind the keyboard or pen; not forced to mold his thinking to the direct response of an audience, he has indirection on his side. He has time to think. Beepo, on the other hand, takes his chances directly facing—or mooning—the audience; a buffoon, a patsy, a performer, he is out in the open and his audience, unlike a humorist's, becomes necessarily half-friend and half-enemy.}}

===Comedians who become humorists===
Sometimes a comedian will adopt a writing career and gain notability as a humorist. Some examples are:

[[Will Rogers]] (1879–1935) was a [[vaudeville]] comedian who started doing humorous political and social commentary, and became a famous newspaper columnist and radio personality during the [[Great Depression]]. He is an exception to the education rule, as he only completed a [[tenth grade#United States|tenth grade]] education.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news| title =Adventure Marked Life of Humorist| work =[[The New York Times]]| publisher =| date =August 17, 1935| url =https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1104.html| accessdate =July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garry Moore]] (1915–1993), known as a television comedian who hosted several [[variety show|variety]] and [[game show]]s, after his 1977 retirement became a regular humor columnist for the newspaper ''[[The Island Packet]]'' of [[Northeast Harbor, Maine]], with a column titled "Mumble, Mumble". He later released a book of his columns under the same name in the early 1980s. 

[[Victor Borge]] (1909–2000) was a Danish-American comedian known for bringing humor to [[classical music]]. He wrote three books, ''My Favorite Intermissions''&lt;ref name="BorgeSherman1971"&gt;{{cite book

Wodehouse]], and has written a Wodehouse-style novel.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hugh Laurie|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013111/|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|credits=Host: James Lipton|network=Bravo|airdate=31 July 2006|season=12|number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark Twain prize===
Despite the name, conference of the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize does not make the awardee a humorist. {{Asof|2017}}, the center has chosen to confer the prize on nineteen comedians and one playwright;&lt;ref name="kennedy-center1"/&gt; only two recipients, the comedian Steve Martin and the playwright [[Neil Simon]], are commonly recognized as humorists in the sense of Twain.

==Films==
===''Ice Age'' (2002)===
{{Main|Ice Age (2002 film)}}
Sid, a talkative sloth, is left behind by his family and the herds of mammals journeying to the south. He meets Manny, a mammoth who travels to the north, and decides to follow him. When a humans' camp is attacked by tigers, a woman takes her baby and jumps into a river and falls over a waterfall. Before she disappears, the baby is rescued by Manny and Sid. The two animals decide to search for the father and return the baby to him. Diego, one of the tigers that attacked the humans, comes also claiming the baby, and the trio form an uneasy alliance during their journey to the humans.

===''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' (2006)===
{{Main|Ice Age: The Meltdown}}
Manny, Sid, and Diego are currently living in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a wall that is barely holding a massive body of water that could flood the valley to nearly a mile underwater. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them all, but they only have three days to reach it or die. Manny is also having trouble fearing the fact that he may be the last mammoth left. Along the way, they meet Ellie, a mammoth who thinks she is a possum, and her possum brothers Crash and Eddie. As they begin to travel together, Manny learns, with help from Diego and Sid, that he must move on from his past. During their journey, [[Scrat]] the sabre-toothed squirrel has his own adventure.

===''Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'' (2009)===
{{Main|Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs}}
Manny and Ellie are expecting their first child, meanwhile Scrat falls in love with fellow squirrel Scratte. Meanwhile, Diego is anxious about settling down for a domestic life with Manny's new family. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own, and steals some dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid ending up in a strange underground world where his herd must rescue him. The herd also meets an insane one-eyed weasel known as Buck who aids them on their quest.

===''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' (2012)===
{{Main|Ice Age: Continental Drift}}
Taking place several years after the events of the third film, with Peaches now a teenager, Scrat's pursuit of acorns has world-changing consequences, separating Manny, Sid and Diego from the rest of their group. As they try to return home, they come into conflict with a pirate gang led by Captain Gutt.

=== {{anchor|Ice_Age_5_.282016.29}}''Ice Age: Collision Course'' (2016) ===
{{Main|Ice Age: Collision Course}}
Set after the events of ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift|Continental Drift]]'', Scrat's pursuit of his elusive acorn catapults him outside of Earth aboard a UFO, where he accidentally sets off a series of cosmic events that transform and threaten the planet. To save themselves from peril, Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd leave their home and reunite with Buck, who leads them on a journey to find a way to save the planet.

===Future===
On the possibility of a potential sequel to ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', in June 2016, Galen T. Chu, co-director of the film, stated that there were some ideas for the next installment.&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickreel.com/ice-age-collision-course-interview-with-co-director-galen-t-chu/|title=ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE INTERVIEW WITH CO-DIRECTOR GALEN T. CHU|author=Cassam Looch|work=Flickreel|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Bustle noted that the potential of ''Ice Age 6'' actually being produced was relatively high even though it could largely depend on the box office performance of the fifth film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/172484-will-there-be-another-ice-age-movie-this-franchise-is-staying-strong|title=Will There Be Another Ice Age Movie?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Ice Wars''' was an annual elite [[figure skating]] team competition. The first Ice Wars took place in 1994. The competition format was "Team World" vs. "Team USA" or "Team North America". The 2005 competition was one exception, with the format changed to a "Battle of the Sexes" format, Men vs. Ladies.  It was an unsanctioned made-for-TV professional event, meaning that skaters who participated would lose their [[amateur sports#Figure skating|eligibility]] to compete in the [[Winter Olympics]] and other events recognized by the [[International Skating Union]].

Men, ladies, [[pair skating|pair skaters]], and [[ice dancing|ice dancers]] have all taken part in Ice Wars, though in 2005 only single skaters competed. 

The event took  place in November, changing locations each year. 

The 2001 competition was renamed "World Ice Challenge" after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States.

The rejection of that doctrine was a basic tenet of romanticism; as Hugo put it in his preface to the 1826 edition of ''Odes et ballades, 'celui qui imite un poete ''romantique'' devient necessairement ''classique'', puisqu'il imite''.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, [[Romanticism]] reversed it with the creation of the institution of [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"/&gt; In the 20th century, the [[modernist]] and [[postmodern]] movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central [[Literary technique|artistic device]].

'''Independent media''' refers to any form of [[media (communication)|media]], such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[newspaper]]s or the [[Internet]], that is free of influence by government or corporate interests. The term has varied applications. Within the [[United States]] and other [[developed country|developed countries]], it is often used synonymously with [[alternative media]] to refer to media that specifically distinguish themselves in relation to the [[mainstream media]]. In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.

==Alternative media==
{{Main|Alternative media}}
In developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or [[state media|government-owned]] [[mass media]]. Proponents of alternative media argue that the mainstream media are [[bias]]ed. While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence "alternative". As such, [[advocacy journalism]] tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term "alternative" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term "independent" over "alternative". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.

==In developing countries==
In many [[developing country|developing countries]], the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the [[economy]], [[health]], and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of [[self-censorship]], soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.

===Self-censorship===
{{Main|Self-censorship}}
Self-censorship is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[classified information|classifying]] one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s. In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger [[advertiser]]s or the publication's [[parent company]] in order to protect their livelihood.

===Soft censorship===
Soft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Soft Censorship: How Governments Around the Globe Use Money to Manipulate the Media'', http://cima.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cima-soft_censorship-report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.

==Development==
{{Main|Media development}}
Many organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its [[Journalism#Professional_and_ethical_standards|professional capacity]]. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

===Media development vs. media for development===
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. "Media for development" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT4D|ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

===Media development organizations===
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are [[Internews]], [[International Center for Journalists]] (ICFJ), and [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] (IREX). In addition, organizations like the [[Center for International Media Assistance]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Article 19]], and others monitor media development efforts and [[freedom of the press]] around the world.

'''JFH: Justice For Hire''' (also known as '''''JFH''''', '''''Justice For Hire''''', and '''''JFH: Justice-For-Hire''''') is a [[mixed martial arts]] themed entertainment property that encompasses a series of comic books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Comics on comiXology|url=http://www.comixology.com/JFH-Justice-For-Hire/comics-series/3286|publisher=ComiXology|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH original short film excerpt|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpnDRLFmnM|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Brawl webisode|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHD-fi6IPk|publisher=Creative Impulse Films|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killa Icons - Ivory featuring Ebony (song)|url=https://soundcloud.com/janlucanus/killa-icons-attention-ivory|website=Soundcloud|publisher=Creative Impulse Music|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Motion Comic Pilot Episode|url=http://vimeo.com/67982313|publisher=Creative Impulse Films|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''JFH'' story follows two sons of a duo of vigilante fathers that get their family's hero-for-hire business legalized, spawning a worldwide industry of heroes, villains, and mercenaries for hire dubbed the Retribution Industry.  Produced and published by [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]], ''JFH'' remains one of the first examples of [[transmedia storytelling]] in the comic book industry.&lt;ref name="The Comic Book Page Podcast on JFH #1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Comic Book Page Podcast on JFH #1|url=http://comicbookdb.com/podcast.php?ID=54|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''JFH'' was created by real-life father/son martial arts champions and comic book writers [[Jan C. Childress]] and [[Jan Lucanus]].  Lucanus appears as a regular cast member in the live action content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH: Justice For Hire - The Web Series Episode #0|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8vGSZ9DaVI|website=YouTube|publisher=Creative Impulse Films|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comic Book History ==

As explained in an interview with [[Kodak]]'s "In Camera" magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus on Film: Justice-for-Hire|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com/live/=Kodak - In Camera Magazine|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; what started as a series of student films Jan Lucanus was directing from his high school and college days at the [[New York Film Academy]] and [[New York University]] grew into expanded short films and an award winning "Justice-For-Hire" 47-minute Featurette&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Father/Son Duo Honored at '05 Budo International Hall of Fame|url=http://www.mauricepromartialarts.com/budo%20gala%20review.html|publisher=Budo International|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that doubled as both Jan's company [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]]'s&lt;ref name="Creative Impulse Entertainment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Creative Impulse Ent. Website|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com|publisher=Creative Impulse Entertainment|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; second narrative production and his NYU senior thesis film. The same footage from the featurette was recut into shorter episodic content, placed on four DVDs, and bundled with issues 1-4 of the "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" comic book series, marking the first time in the history of the comic book industry in which a physical comic book and DVD combination package was sold for an entire series run.&lt;ref name="Midtown Comics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucanus|first=Jan|title=JFH: Justice-For-Hire #4|year=2008|publisher=Creative Impulse Publishing|pages=32|url=http://www.midtowncomics.com/store/dp.asp?prid=1000314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Launch ===

In 2007, ''JFH'' co-creator Jan Lucanus took an independent approach to spreading the word about his new comic series, doing a pre-release print run that debuted at the [[New York Comic Con]], and calling upon his contacts in the martial arts community and across media to get the comics to people outside of the traditional comic book audience (the print comic book industry was notorious for marketing only to comic book readers, rather than targeting audiences outside of the [[niche market]]&lt;ref name="Niche Comic Market"&gt;{{cite web|title=Niche Comic Market|url=http://www.comicbookmanifesto.com|publisher=The Comic Book Manifesto|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  "JFH" comics were given away in martial arts contests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JFH Contest - Inside Kung Fu Magazine|url=http://www.justice-for-hire.com/html/downloads.php|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=Inside Kung Fu Magazine|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at events for [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[VH1]], and [[Adidas]].  Later that year, marketing guru [[Ken Goldstein]] and entrepreneur Tonny Sorenson, along with partner Bob Johnson,&lt;ref name="Bob Johnson bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Johnson bio|url=http://www.xmedialab.com/mentor/bob-l-johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; made Jan the first Artist-in-Residence (''AiR'') within their lifestyle brand, [[Von Dutch]] (the ''AiR'' program later transformed into the Planet Illogica agency&lt;ref name="Planet Illogica designs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Illogica designs|url=http://murphydesign1.blogspot.com/2009/04/planet-illogica-launch-and-introduction.html|publisher=Mark Murphy|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Before the official market release, "JFH" comics were distributed within the [[SoHo]], New York and [[Los Angeles]], California Von Dutch store fronts.  On September 27, 2007, Jan co-hosted the Von Dutch-sponsored launch event for the "JFH" comic book - "Justice-For-Hire Presents Fight Night at the Von Dutch" in Los Angeles, CA.  Gift bags filled with "JFH" comics and other sponsored items were given to a crowd of 1,100 spectators as they were presented with martial arts demonstrations and exhibition fights from Jan and his "JFH" fight team members, including champion fighters Hinton Wells,&lt;ref name="Hinton Wells vs. Jan Lucanus - San Da demo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hinton Wells vs. Jan Lucanus - San Da demo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lodpBeijUvg|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Morgan,&lt;ref name="Ian Morgan vs Gabe Dorado Muay Thai- JFH/Von Dutch event"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Morgan vs Gabe Dorado Muay Thai- JFH/Von Dutch event|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkt1wdrgUk8|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximillion Chen,&lt;ref name="Maximillion Chen vs. Mercer Boffey - JFH/Von Dutch event"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximillion Chen vs. Mercer Boffey - JFH/Von Dutch event|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6aFIzCL4fc|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabe Dorado, [[Ahmed Best]], Jesse Abrescy,&lt;ref name="Jesse Abrescy IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesse Abrescy IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1444917/|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] Master John Machado,&lt;ref name="John Machado BJJ demo JFH/Von Dutch"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Machado BJJ demo JFH/Von Dutch|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6y0_WkibCQ|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with Jan's father Jan C.

Other performances included an [[Oprah Winfrey]]-sponsored choir,&lt;ref name="JFH/Von Dutch Fight Night - A Bloggers Recap"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH/Von Dutch Fight Night - A Bloggers Recap|url=http://creativeimpulsecomics.com/JFH-Fight-Night-at-Von-Dutch-A-Blogger-Recap-by-Darion-Lowenstein.pdf|publisher=Darion Lowenstein|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acrobatics from [[Cirque du Soleil]] troop, REALIS.&lt;ref name="REALIS profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=REALIS profile|url=http://www.gigsalad.com/realis_is_arthur_davis_and_shenea_booth|publisher=[[GigSalad]]|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sponsors included Hollywood's [[Golden Apple Comics]] shop, [[Inside Kung Fu]] Magazine, [[Black Belt (magazine)]], Alacer Corp.

=== Print Distribution &amp; Reviews ===

A year of independent promotions and the non-traditional packaging of comics &amp; DVD's landed Jan's small, newly formed publishing subsidiary, Creative Impulse Publishing, a vendor deal with [[Diamond Comics]] Distributors, the worldwide monopoly for printed comics distribution.  Creative Impulse Publishing officially released of the first issue of the printed "JFH" comic book/DVD bundles to comic shops internationally on December 26, 2007.,&lt;ref name="JFH #1 release"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucanus|first=Jan|title=JFH: Justice-For-Hire #1|year=2007|publisher=Creative Impulse Publishing|pages=32|url=http://www.legacycomics.net/item/OCT073385/JFH-Justice-For-Hire-1-of-12-Cvr-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a bi-monthly release schedule into June 2008 to critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="The Comic Book Page Podcast on JFH #1"/&gt; The "JFH" comic book received 4 out of 4 stars from Newsarama.com, which reviewed the book as "cinematic genius on the printed page...some of the most realistic kung-fu sequences ever drawn for a comic book". The live action DVD content received positive reviews from several media outlets including TheComicBookPage.com podcast, which is quoted, "the [live action] content was excellent. The basic premise for the series...absolutely brilliant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Creative Impulse Spotlight on TheComicBookPage.com|url=http://www.comicspodcasts.com/2010/09/29/publisher-spotlight-004-creative-impulse-entertainment/|accessdate=21 October 2013|newspaper=The Comic Book Page Podcast|date=September 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concept of "JFH"'s Retribution Industry has also been criticized by several media outlets including Comics Forge, "Overall because of the moral ambiguity in the story lines, I am going to rate this 4 of 5, technically excellent, but morally questionable",&lt;ref name="Comics Forge JFH critique"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morril|first=Dan|title=Justice for Hire|url=http://www.comicsforge.com/2012/01/justice-for-hire/|publisher=Comics Forge|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Geeksmash.com, "When all you need is money to get rid of a problem, the team could easily degrade into hit-men to the highest bidder.  I don’t know if the creators are as concerned with these thematic messages as much as they simply want to put out a cool, tough fighting book".&lt;ref name='Geeksmash Review of "JFH" #0'&gt;{{cite news|last=Burrows|first=Jon|title=Review: Justice For Hire #0|url=http://geeksmash.com/comic-books/review-justice-for-hire-0-81312|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=Geeksmash|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Comics ===

After the initial "JFH" print release, [[Creative Impulse Entertainment]] was approached by [[comiXology]] to produce a "JFH" iPhone app that carried both the comic and the live action video. ComiXology was concurrently developing a new digital comics service and was seeking indie publishers to release their comics digitally and prove the viability of the digital comics business to larger publishers.

Announced at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic Con International]] Superhero Kung Fu Extravaganza, the live-action adaptation of ''JFH: Justice-For-Hire'' is slated for production via a partnership between [[Jan Lucanus]]'s company Creative Impulse Entertainment.&lt;ref name="Creative Impulse Entertainment"/&gt; (CIE) and the Canadian-based Spillwall Productions.&lt;ref name="Spillwall Productions website" /&gt; Jan will co-direct and co-star as one of the main characters, "Ebony",.&lt;ref name="Graphicly JFH Free For All Winner Will Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montegomery|first=Paul|title=Graphicly JFH Free For All Winner Will Roberts|url=http://blog.graphicly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Ebony-Will-Roberts.jpg|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Graphicly|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The feature follows an original story conceived by Jan and developed via a partnership between CIE and Nine Dot Entertainment that will act as a prequel to the first season of ''JFH'' comics.&lt;ref name='ComiXology - "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" Comics'&gt;{{cite web|title=ComiXology - "JFH: Justice-For-Hire" Comics|url=http://www.comixology.com/JFH-Justice-For-Hire/comics-series/3286|publisher=ComiXology|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay is co-written by Jan, award-winning screenwriter and director Aurore Barry,&lt;ref name="Aurore Barry IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aurore Barry IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1927804/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jan's father, comic book writer Jan C.

In 2013, the ''JFH'' creative team launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to shoot a short film to establish the cinematic tone for the ''JFH'' feature, as well as test out a martial arts camera system designed for the film, called "Weapon Camera Movement".  The short, entitled ''JFH: Justice For Hire - Retribution Task Force'', brought together several characters across the ''JFH'' Universe for a common goal - stopping acts of violence against women committed by the [[Raskol gangs]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH Kickstarter|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1958778211/jfh-justice-for-hire|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film premiered at the 2014 Comic Con Superhero Kung Fu Extravaganza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyers|first1=Ric|title=San Diego Comic Con Kung Fu Extravaganza 2014 Playlist!|url=http://ricmeyers.com/2014/08/01/san-diego-comic-con-kung-fu-extravaganza-2014-playlist/|website=RicMeyers.com|publisher=Ric Meyers|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a featured screening at the HBO/Cinemax Urban Action Showcase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH at HBO Cinemax Urban Action Showcase|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/vAVZNXHXEl/?taken-by=justiceforhire|website=Instagram|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bent-Con&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFH at Bent-Con|url=https://bentcon2014.sched.org/event/1vui/jfh-justice-for-hire-retribution-task-force|website=Bent-Con|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year.

{{nihongo|'''''Kantai Collection'''''|艦隊これくしょん|Kantai Korekushon|lit. "Fleet Collection", subtitled as "Combined Fleet Girls Collection"}}, abbreviated as {{nihongo|'''''KanColle'''''|艦これ|KanKore}}, is a Japanese [[free-to-play]] web browser game developed by [[Kadokawa Games]].&lt;ref name=kotaku&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/07/japans-latest-popular-online-game-has-anthropomorphic-battleships/ |title = Japan's Latest Popular Online Game Has Anthropomorphic Battleships |website = Kotaku |date = 2013-07-19 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.famitsu.com/news/201309/07039658.html |title = 「提督といっしょに創り上げていきたい」『艦隊これくしょん 艦これ』キーマン・田中謙介氏インタビュー【前編】 |publisher = [[Famitsu]] |date = 2013-09-07 |accessdate = 2013-09-25 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The central theme of the game is the representation of [[World War II]] [[warships]] as cute human girls with personality characteristics reflecting the history of each ship.  Originally, all of these were Japanese, but as the game has developed, ships from other nations have also been added.  Gameplay involves all aspects of naval warfare, including not only combat, but also maintenance, repair, upgrading, resupply, morale, logistics and mission planning.

The game was launched on April 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.4gamer.net/games/205/G020591/20130419103/ |title = 「艦隊これくしょん -艦これ-」正式サービスが4月23日にスタート |publisher = 4gamer |date = 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, the game is available in Japan only and has 3 million registered players.&lt;ref name=playerstats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascii.jp/elem/000/001/001/1001334/ |title=祝2周年！ 艦これはこれからも拡大を続けていく |date=April 23, 2015 |website=ASCII.jp |accessdate=April 26, 2015 |language=ja |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425191903/http://ascii.jp/elem/000/001/001/1001334/ |archivedate=April 25, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has developed into a much larger media franchise; various media including multiple manga series and light novels have been released, in addition to an officially licensed [[tabletop role-playing game]]. A [[PlayStation Vita]] game was released in February 2016,&lt;ref name=vitareleaseFeb/&gt; and an [[Kantai Collection (anime)|anime television series]] began airing its first season in January 2015,&lt;ref name=famiani&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.famitsu.com/news/201309/26040709.html |title = 【速報】『艦これ改 (仮)』PS Vitaで2014年発売決定 『艦これ』アニメ化企画も進行中！ |publisher = [[Famitsu]] |date = 2013-09-26 |accessdate = 2013-09-26 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an [[KanColle: The Movie|animated film]]&lt;ref name=annfilm/&gt; released in November 2016 as the sequel to the series.

[[File:Kantai Collection interface.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Top:''' Home shipyard interface screenshot&lt;br&gt;'''Bottom:''' In-game battle interface screenshot]]
The gameplay is centred upon building squadrons composed of individual characters represented as cards with different attributes, and then sending said squadrons out on missions. Each of the characters are [[moe anthropomorphism]]s of [[World War II]] naval [[warship]]s which are depicted as cute girls, known as {{nihongo|"Fleet girls"|艦娘|kanmusu}}.&lt;ref name=susume_intro&gt;{{Cite journal |date = 2013-09-30 |journal = {{Nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Recommend the naval base life''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 鎮守府生活のすゝめ}} |title=— |volume = 1 |pages = 4–27 |publisher = [[Enterbrain]] |ISBN = 978-4047292338 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger [[Displacement (ship)|displacement tonnage]] are usually depicted as young women, while smaller ships look and behave like pubescent girls, with a few exceptions). The player takes on the role of an {{nihongo|admiral|提督|teitoku}} and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is largely automated, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building and repairing.&lt;ref name=kotaku/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://weekly.ascii.jp/elem/000/000/162/162183/ |title = 新サーバー開設！これから始める『艦隊これくしょん』のススメ |publisher = Weekly ASCII Plus |date = 2013-08-13 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can organise up to four different fleets.&lt;ref name=dannychoo&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/27073/Kantai+Collection.html |title = Kantai Collection |publisher = Danny Choo |website = Culture Japan |date = 2013-10-10 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player progresses through the game by advancing through maps, gaining experience points through [[Grinding (video gaming)|grinding]], obtaining new fleet girls whilst repairing and resupplying existing ones, and fulfilling quests to obtain resources. New equipment can be crafted, allowing the fleet girls to equip different armaments depending on the situation.&lt;ref name=susume_intro/&gt; Acquisition of new ''kanmusu'' by the player can occur via drops on map or via crafting, and is heavily [[Random number generation|RNG]]-based; randomisation is also a key component of the battle mechanism, map progression and equipment development.&lt;ref name=dannychoo/&gt; Construction, resupply and repair of ships is reliant upon four types of resources, namely [[fuel]], [[ammunition]], [[steel]] and [[bauxite]]; these supplies will gradually increase automatically as time passes. Players can choose to engage in expeditions, sorties and quests to further increase their supplies as well.&lt;ref name=dannychoo/&gt;

Ships can be customised through the addition of various equipment within their empty slots, which add attribute bonuses and even provide special effects in some cases;&lt;ref name=susume_intro/&gt; such equipment include [[naval gun]]s, [[anti-aircraft gun]]s, [[torpedo]]es, [[torpedo bomber]]s, [[dive bomber]]s, [[fighter aircraft]], [[seaplane]]s, [[recon plane]]s, [[radar]]s, [[steam turbine]]s, special artillery shells, [[depth charge]]s, [[sonar]]s, [[Drum (container)|drum canisters]], [[searchlight]]s and [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s. The effectiveness of ships in combat depend on its attribute parameters, namely hitpoints, armour, evasion, aircraft capacity, speed, attack range, firepower, torpedo, anti-air, anti-submarine, line-of-sight, and luck.&lt;ref name=catalogue&gt;{{Cite book |date = 2014-06-10 |publisher = [[Kadokawa Shoten]] |title = {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Ship Girl Catalogue''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 艦娘型録}} |ISBN = 978-4041106341 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kanmusu'' are capable of becoming stronger as they gain experience and level up after battles, and can also be remodeled into more advanced models once they reach a certain level. Unwanted ''kanmusu'' can also be "fed" to other ''kanmusu'' through a process known as {{nihongo|"modernisation"|近代化改修|kindaika kaishu}}, which grants attribute bonuses to one ship in exchange for losing another.&lt;ref name=dannychoo/&gt; Ships can become fatigued once it accumulates after sorties; fatigued ships have decreased attributes, whilst sparkling ships have increased attributes. Fatigue can be alleviated by allowing ships some time to rest, or by recovering the fleet's morale using {{ship|Japanese food supply ship|Mamiya||6}}. As ships become damaged, their icons begin to blow off smoke and their clothing become visually torn and battered; in the event when a ship's durability drops down to zero, it is considered sunk, and the player will lose the fleet girl.&lt;ref name=dannychoo/&gt; Players cannot resurrect fleet girls that have been lost unless they are in possession of an emergency repair item, and are only able to re-train ships that have been lost from scratch.

Whilst the game is free-to-play, special premium bonuses can be obtained through prepaid game money and credit card micropayments, such as repair dock expansions, home shipyard furniture tokens, ship possession limit increases and special consumable items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://thepage.jp/detail/20130812-00010004-wordleaf |title = 「艦隊これくしょん」ブレークの背景 ソーシャルゲームの新しい可能性とは？ |publisher = THE PAGE |date = 2013-08-12 |accessdate = 2013-08-13 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each ship in the game has an experience level cap of Lv.99, the player is able to obtain the "marriage papers and ring" item with a monetary purchase priced at 700 yen or via a one-time special quest, which allows the player to "marry" the girl, thereby breaking the original level cap and allowing a new maximum of Lv.165, in addition to other perks such as stat boosts and decreased operating costs; this process can be repeated as many times as the player wishes, and there is no limit to the number of girls that can be "married".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/02/14/kancolle-now-lets-you-marry-your-ship-daughter |title = "KanColle" Now Lets You Marry Your Ship Daughter |publisher = Crunchyroll |date = 2014-02-14 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players can choose to battle against the fleets of other real-life players on the same game server via the exercise maneuvers menu. Players are also able to compete with each other's scores via in-game ranking boards, with periodical prizes for top ranking players. As of January 2016, there are 20 servers that can be played on, each named after a World War II-era Japanese naval base.&lt;ref name=catalogue/&gt; The game is currently intended to be played by a Japanese domestic audience only, with the interface exclusively in the Japanese language. As of present, the game cannot be played outside Japan without the use of a [[Virtual private network|VPN]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://kotaku.com/japans-biggest-gaming-phenomenon-of-2013-1491186648 |title = Japan's Biggest Gaming Phenomenon of 2013 |website = Kotaku |author = Toshi Nakamura |date = 2013-12-31 |accessdate = 2015-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; utilisation of such methods to circumvent country [[IP address|IP]] restrictions and access the game breach the DMM.com online game terms of use, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dmm.com/rule/=/category=onlinegame_service/ |title=DMMオンラインゲーム利用規約 (DMM online game Terms of Use) |publisher=DMM.com |accessdate=2015-02-02 |language=ja }} '''Quote:''' "第6条（禁止事項）... （8）不正な方法（特殊なプログラムを介しての）でのアクセスを試みる行為".

The traits of each fleet girl are based on aspects of the historical ship they are based on; for instance, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kongō||6}} frequently adds English words and phrases into her dialog as a reference to her British origins, whilst {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Shimakaze|1942|6}} is depicted as a speedy girl in artworks and official print media, since ''Shimakaze'' was one of the fastest destroyer ships of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://rocketnews24.com/2013/11/03/384638/ |title = 「強烈な艦これファンが選ぶ！ 人気ゲーム『艦隊これくしょん』お付き合いしたい艦ベスト10 |publisher = Rocket News 24 |date = 2013-11-03 |accessdate = 2015-01-25 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters which share particular links also have similar physical traits: ships of the same class may have similar accessories or clothing, whilst all Imperial Japanese Navy submarines are depicted as wearing [[sukumizu]].

[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actors]] have been employed to voice the fleet girls, with anywhere around 10 fleet girls being voiced by one actor.

==Development==
Prior to ''Kantai Collection'', the majority of games published by DMM.com were R-18+ adult online games. In an effort to attract customers from a wider audience, DMM.com experimented with ''Kantai Collection'' in partnership with Kadokawa Games; by November 2013, ''Kantai Collection'' accounted for 30-40% of DMM.com's total online game business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://ascii.jp/elem/000/000/842/842194/ |title = 艦これをパズドラと並べないでください |publisher = ASCII.jp |date = 2013-11-14 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other online games in Japan, ''Kantai Collection'' was designed with the intention of not forcing the player to spend money or participate in "gacha" lotteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/154/G015406/20130725012/|title=「KILLER IS DEAD」「艦これ」そして「天空の機士ロデア」――角川ゲームス 安田善巳社長が，同社の最新作とその先について語ってくれた|date=July 27, 2013|website=4gamer|language=ja|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepage.jp/detail/20130812-00010004-wordleaf|title=「艦隊これくしょん」ブレークの背景　ソーシャルゲームの新しい可能性とは？|date=August 12, 2013|website=The Page|language=ja|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this stems from Kadokawa desiring a larger target market and to establish the game as a well-known name, eventually allowing for merchandising and sales of franchise works.&lt;ref name=huffpost_kancorebus/&gt;

Kensuke Tanaka, who prior to ''Kantai Collection'' was involved in the production and public relations for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XI|XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII|XIII]]'', wished to create a game which involves historical elements while still appealing to the regular fans of DMM.com, namely fans of anime and manga culture, and this led him to the idea of developing a game centred on anthropomorphisms of warships.

In March 2014, financial analyst Fukuda Sōichirō of [[Citigroup Global Markets Japan]] made the prediction in a stock investor report that the PS Vita game would ship 500,000 copies, and expects that a profit of 1 billion yen be made.

The game charges players with a GP system akin to that of ''[[Border Break]]'', where money is converted into GP at a specific rate, with these points consumed for each second of play or converted in exchange for various other game elements. The game is controlled using a steering wheel and speed lever, and the player is able to organise their fleet using ''kanmusu'' cards ejected by the arcade machine. While in combat, the player can choose between using primary and secondary armaments, torpedoes and airstrikes against foes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/02/20/sega-puts-kancolle-arcade-on-display-at-japan-amusement-expo|title=Sega Puts "KanColle Arcade" on Display at Japan Amusement Expo|date=February 21, 2016|website=Crunchyroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and setting==
Whilst the original game does not have a particular storyline, and largely focuses on gameplay, each of the official media works feature various settings with separate and differing canons. Not only do the stories differ, but also the depictions and interpretations of fleet girls and the manner in which they engage in combat. The game does not strictly define anything relating to its setting, allowing for a greater diversity of secondary literary adaptation works which cater to different audiences, and more artistic freedom among secondary works which can approach the setting of ''Kantai Collection'' differently.

Kadokawa has not officially announced whether any secondary work is absolute canon, nor have they released significant quantities of canonical material, with some official works even contradicting one another. For instance, some manga anthology depictions show the ship girls as ship-sized giants, while other serialised manga show them as human-sized. The television animation explains the ship girls as humans born with the ability to possess the spirits of World War II warships, while within the ''Bonds of the Wings of Cranes'' light novel, the girls refer to themselves as actual warships, and that their origin is unknown.

===2015 anime television series===
{{main|Kantai Collection (anime)#Plot}}

===''KanColle: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes''===
Within the story of ''Bonds of the Wings of Cranes'', the setting is within an alternate universe where [[World War II]] never took place. The fleet of the Abyss, consisting of monster ships, lock down access to the seas and indiscriminately fire upon vessels and aircraft, and feed on the corpses of dead sailors in the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Hiroki Uchida |date = 2014-02-20 |title = {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 鶴翼の絆}} |page = 29 |publisher = [[Fujimi Shobo]] |ISBN = 978-4040700328 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of abyssals, along with their regenerating ability, allowed them to easily defeat the conventional navies and modern militaries of the world. Ship girls are the guardians of humanity and human-weapon hybrids that are summoned using {{nihongo|spirit energy|霊力}}, with female forms as the ships they represent have female souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Hiroki Uchida |date = 2014-02-20 |title = {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 鶴翼の絆}} |pages = 35–37, 79 |publisher = [[Fujimi Shobo]] |ISBN = 978-4040700328 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zuikaku'', having taken a humanoid form, remembers a time where she was once a ship, however does not know the reason behind her human form.

The fleet girls live within an old-fashioned Japanese-style hotel which doubles as the girls' dormitory, and is close to a nearby factory which services combat equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Hiroki Uchida |date = 2014-02-20 |title = {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 鶴翼の絆}} |page = 23 |publisher = [[Fujimi Shobo]] |ISBN = 978-4040700328 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; The admiral of the fleet is a young man who behaves like a pervert, fond of groping the ship girls and playing with their skirts, although his personality does become serious when commanding the fleet. As the ship girls and abyssal fleets engage in combat, both sides are guarded by a protective barrier. The aircraft carriers ''Akagi'' and ''Kaga'' are depicted as firing [[Arrow|archery arrows]] from a bow which then transform into fighter planes. Armaments are detachable equipment, and when not in combat gear the ships otherwise appear as ordinary girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Hiroki Uchida |date = 2014-02-20 |title = {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Bonds of the Wings of Cranes''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 鶴翼の絆}} |pages = 75–77 |publisher = [[Fujimi Shobo]] |ISBN = 978-4040700328 |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''KanColle: Kagerō, Setting Sail!''===
This light novel is set within a universe based on the real world, where normal girls undergo training to become ship girls. Hundreds of warships were destroyed by abyssal forces which spontaneously emerge from anywhere under the sea, and as a result, ship girls are employed to counter the threat.&lt;ref&gt;2013-11-30, Toshihiko Tsukiji, {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Kagerō, Setting Sail!''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 陽炎、抜錨します!}}. [[Enterbrain]]. {{ISBN|978-4047292666}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''KanColle: Someday as the Seas turn Calm''===
A series of mini-arcs connecting a ship girl to her existing counterpart by gradually introducing characters and rotating the leads. Within this manga, ship girls are depicted as flying on the water surface whilst in combat against the abyss fleet of monster ships, and launch aircraft managed by tiny fairies in a [[Takeoff and landing|conventional takeoff]] manner from their body attachments. Artillery and torpedo combat is shown to be performed at long range, whilst anti-submarine warfare takes place in close quarters.

===''Torpedo Squadron Chronicles''===
This manga adaptation focuses on the adventures of the Tenryū class and Akatsuki class, as it follows the newly assigned Tenryū and her new squadron in solving the mystery of the Abyssal Fleet.

===''KanColle: Shimakaze Whirlwind Girl''===
This manga depicts the story of a newly appointed, rookie officer by the name of Ensign Akai who arrives at the [[Maizuru Naval District|Maizuru Naval Base]] for duty as the assistant to the vice-admiral, however has to deal with a stubborn and difficult ''Shimakaze'' who spends most of her time alone, and does not have any friends. Multiple nations around the world have developed ship girls for their navy power, and Maizuru is one of the major bases of Japan responsible for managing them.&lt;ref&gt;2014-10-27, Kazuma Yamazaki/Hyōbu Madoka, {{nihongo|''Kantai Collection: Shimakaze Whirlwind Girl, Volume 1''|艦隊これくしょん -艦これ- 島風 つむじ風の少女 1}}. [[ASCII Media Works]]. {{ISBN|978-4048666121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''KanColle: Fubuki, Ganbarimasu!''===
This [[slice of life]] 4koma depicts the everyday life of the ship girls at the fleet training school, where newly manufactured ship girls spend one year learning knowledge before setting out to sea. Most of the scenarios are taken from the point of view of ''Fubuki'', and feature the girls doing fun things with one another, which include attending school, drinking tea, celebrating various holidays like Tanabata, Halloween and Christmas, in addition to the occasional sortie. The ship girls retain memories of their previous lives from World War II, at times displaying signs of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. References to their personal histories and characteristics are common and usually used to comedic effect. This manga depicts the ship girls as being able to walk on the surface of the water in a manner akin to ice-skating, just like in the anime series.

==Merchandise and other collaborations==
Merchandise based on the game have been launched as a result of the success of the online game, proliferation of derivative works, and strong interest in the franchise.

==Reception==

===Player population===
Due to the high popularity of the game within Japan, game operators created larger numbers of servers in early 2013 to cope with the influx of players.&lt;ref name=kotaku/&gt; During August 2013, the number of new players spiked by 100,000 people within one week, to a total of 600,000 people, with 350,000 daily active players.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; By September 2013, it was reported that there were more than 800,000 players regularly active.&lt;ref name=800k/&gt; The total number of players broke 1,000,000 on 9 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.inside-games.jp/article/2013/10/10/71039.html |title = 提督100万人突破、そして島田フミカネ氏による航空母艦も実装決定！ ─ 『艦これ』秋のイベントも実施準備中 |date = 2013-10-10 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Inside |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, there were 3 million players.&lt;ref name=playerstats/&gt; One commonly cited explanation behind the success of the game is that players aren't forced to spend money to play, unlike other popular Japanese online games; the free-to-play nature of ''Kantai Collection'' makes in-game purchases optional, and not a necessity.&lt;ref name=dannychoo/&gt; It is estimated that on average, ''Kantai Collection'' players spend less money on the game compared to the popular Japanese games ''[[Puzzle &amp; Dragons]]'', ''[[The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls]]'' and ''[[Love Live!#Video games|Love Live!

Interest in ''Kantai Collection'' has significantly risen over the months following its release, to the point where it has often been compared with the fandom of ''[[Touhou Project]]'' as an emerging viral fandom.

===Financial reception and sales figures===
Speaking at a symposium held by Kadokawa ASCII Research Institute on 27 September 2013, the chairman of the board of directors of [[Kadokawa Corporation|Kadokawa Group Holdings]], [[:ja:角川歴彦|Tsuguhiko Kadokawa]], stated that despite the game's popularity, ''Kantai Collection'' is nearly unprofitable for the company, in part due to the game being funded by various company partnerships, such as the profit-sharing agreement made between Kadokawa Group and [[DMM Corporation|DMM Group]], given that none of the game's development fees were paid for by Kadokawa. Kadokawa's stock price rose by 1000 yen within June 2013, following the initial rise of the game. It is expected that Kadokawa will need to rely on sales of intellectual property media works such as books and manga in order to raise profits.&lt;ref name=huffpost_kancorebus&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2013/09/27/kankore-business_n_4001827.html |title = 「艦これ、ほとんど儲からない」角川歴彦会長が明かす |date = 2013-09-27 |accessdate = 2013-10-02 |website = [[Huffington Post]] |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadokawa Games president Yoshimi Yasuda affirms that the free-to-play business model of the game will not change despite reports of a lack of revenue gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://diamond.jp/articles/-/43447 |title = 半年で100万ユーザー突破！「艦隊これくしょん～艦これ～」大ヒットから見えるポスト・ソーシャルゲームビジネスの行方――角川ゲームス安田善巳社長インタビュー |date = 2013-10-24 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Diamond OnLine |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, game distributor [[DMM Corporation]] gained 7 billion yen from the game as of June 2014, which is equivalent to 140 times the value of the game's development costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASFK17037_X10C14A6000000/|title=異形の急成長企業ＤＭＭ、多角化とトップの実像|date=June 27, 2014|publisher=[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toshihiko Tsukiji's light novel ''Kantai Collection: Kagerō, Setting Sail!'' sold 16,624 copies within its first week of release, placing 11th place within the [[Oricon]] book ranking charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/obb/w/2013-12-09/more/3/ |title = 2013年11月25日～2013年12月01日の文庫 |date = 2013-12-09 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Oricon |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also debuting the same week were the ''Sasebo Naval District Compilation Vol.1'' and ''Maizuru Naval District Compilation Vol.1'' comic anthologies, which sold 59,552 copies and 58,110 copies respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/obc/w/2013-12-09/more/3/ |title = 2013年11月25日～2013年12月01日のコミック |date = 2013-12-09 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Oricon |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-November 2013, ''Yokosuka Naval District Compilation Vol.1'' sold 48,909 copies during its first week, placing 10th place among all comic sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/obc/w/2013-11-25/more/2/ |title = 2013年11月11日～2013年11月17日のコミック |date = 2013-11-25 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Oricon |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first manga volume of ''Fubuki, Ganbarimasu!'' sold 28,324 copies within its first week in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-12-18/japanese-comic-ranking-december-9-15 |title = Japanese Comic Ranking, December 9–15 |date = 2013-12-18 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Anime News Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''KanColle White Paper'' official book published by Kadokawa placed third overall within the Oricon book charts during its debut week in October 2013, selling 46,039 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/ob/w/2013-10-28/ |title = 2013年10月14日～2013年10月20日のBOOK(総合) |date = 2013-10-28 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = Oricon |language = ja }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political commentary===
An editorial within the South Korean ''[[Hankook Ilbo]]'' on 4 November 2013 accuses that the strong popularity of the game is due to a conservative political shift amongst young people in Japan following long-term economic recession and political instability, and that the game majestifies the wartime [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/201311/h2013110321115924420.htm |title=일본 우경화에 대한 단상 |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |publisher=[[Hankook Ilbo]] |author=김범수 (Kim Bum-soo) |language=ko |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KsbCjElw?url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/201311/h2013110321115924420.htm |archivedate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the ''Hankook Ilbo'' allegation, Akky Akimoto writing for ''[[The Japan Times]]'' disagrees with the idea that the game's design deliberately facilitates any political shift, and argues that the 1970s anime series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' was subject to similar criticisms despite having little effect on domestic politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2014/02/20/digital/kantai-collection-social-game-of-warships-sets-course-for-big-money/ |title =‘Kantai Collection’: Social game of warships sets course for big money |date = 2014-02-20 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = [[The Japan Times]] |author = Akky Akimoto }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another opinion piece from the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' suggests that the game's unforgiving mechanics, such as ships permanently sinking, some of them may even trace for their grandparents' military service history, so helps players understand the brutality of war given the desperate situations, that they can gain a more positive understanding of history or even oppose conflict itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASG5F455FG5FPWPJ004.html|title=（声）「艦これ」ブーム 戦中派不安|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|date=May 24, 2014|language=ja|accessdate=February 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525035147/http://www.asahi.com/articles/ASG5F455FG5FPWPJ004.html|archive-date=May 25, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jonathan Gad of ''[[Vice Media, Inc.|Vice]]'' claims that the ''Kantai Collection'' anime television series is historically revisionist, criticising the show's depiction of the Japanese protagonists being victorious over the [[Battle of Midway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-japanese-military-is-getting-offensively-cute |title=The Japanese Military Is Getting Offensively Cute |author=Jonathan Gad |date=April 13, 2015 |publisher=[[Vice Media, Inc.]] |accessdate=April 14, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414090620/https://news.vice.com/article/the-japanese-military-is-getting-offensively-cute |archivedate=April 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual property infringement outside Japan===
In January 2015, allegations arose that the company Beijing Longzhu Digital Technology ({{lang|zh|北京龙珠数码科技}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2014/12/11/kancolle-chinese-copy_n_6312662.html |date = 2014-12-12 |website = [[Huffington Post]] |title = 【艦これ】中国の海賊版「艦娘国服」にDMMが対抗措置を検討 |language = ja |accessdate = 2015-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which runs an unofficial pirated KanColle server in Mainland China, spent {{CNY|700,000}} ({{USD|112,800}}) in purchasing various Chinese-language KanColle internet forums such as the KanColle subforum on [[Baidu Tieba]]; online discussion boards intended for discussing the original Japanese game were closed down or placed under new management, while the forums of the pirated bootleg Chinese KanColle remained online. This led to widespread unrest amongst Chinese players of the original game, resulting in large-scale internet raids on forums and social media, [[distributed denial-of-service attack]]s, and [[Website defacement|website defacing]] via [[SQL injection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://games.sina.com.cn/y/n/2015-01-16/1410851086.shtml |title = 资深程序揭秘 "舰娘国服"实为"私服" |date = 2015-01-16 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = [[Sina Corp]] |language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt; by hackers against those running the bootleg server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.3dmgame.com/news/201501/3429829.html |title = 《舰娘》国服70万买下舰娘贴吧 引来粉丝疯狂攻击 |date = 2015-01-15 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = 3DM游戏 |language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://fj.ifeng.com/news/jinriredian/detail_2015_01/15/3435130_0.shtml |title = 舰娘国服70万买贴吧迎来恐怖攻击 舰娘国服7次被黑始末曝光 |date = 2015-01-15 |accessdate = 2015-02-12 |publisher = [[Phoenix Television|Phoenix New Media Limited]] |language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article published by [[China Central Television]] referred to the incident as the largest online mass boycott and protest against [[intellectual property]] infringement in China, and a wake-up call for the Chinese gaming industry as a whole to strive for integrity and refrain from creating copycat works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.cntv.cn/2015/news_01_0120/166854.shtml |title=中国"提督"们的抗争 和《舰娘国服》之谜 |date=January 20, 2015 |publisher=[[China Central Television]] |accessdate=February 21, 2015 |language=zh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221145443/http://games.cntv.cn/2015/news_01_0120/166854.shtml |archive-date=February 21, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">'''Knismesis''' and '''gargalesis''' are the [[science|scientific]] terms, coined in 1897 by [[psychology|psychologist]]s [[G. Stanley Hall]] and [[Arthur Allin]],&lt;ref&gt;Hall, G. S., and A. Allin. (1897) ''The psychology of tickling, laughing and the comic.'' The American Journal of Psychology 9:1&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; used to describe the two types of [[tickling]]. Knismesis refers to the light, feather-like type of tickling. This type of tickling generally does not induce [[laughter]] and is often accompanied by an [[itch]]ing sensation.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Christine R. (1999): ''The mystery of ticklish laughter''. American Scientist, July&amp;ndash;August v87 i4 p344(8).&lt;/ref&gt; Gargalesis refers to harder, laughter-inducing tickling, and involves the repeated application of high pressure to sensitive areas.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; While the two terms are used in academic papers, they do not appear in many dictionaries and their origin is rarely declared. The term knismesis comes from the Greek &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;knismos&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning itching&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=knismos&amp;la=greek|title=Definition of knismós in Liddell &amp; Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term gargalesis stems from the Greek &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;gargalizein&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; meaning to tickle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=gargalizein&amp;la=greek|title=Definition of gargalizein in Liddell &amp; Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The suffix &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;-esis&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; is used to form nouns of action or process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.star2.com/living/2018/04/09/tickling-cats-tummy/|title=Tickling A Cat’s Tummy: Invite For Cuddles Or Lacerated Hands? {{!}} Star2.com|date=2018-04-09|work=Star2.com|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Knismesis ==
{{wiktionary|knismesis}}
The knismesis phenomenon requires low levels of stimulation to sensitive parts of the body, and can be triggered by a light [[touch]] or by a light [[electric current]]. Knismesis can also be triggered by crawling [[insect]]s or [[parasite]]s, prompting scratching or rubbing at the ticklish spot, thereby removing the pest. It is possible that this function explains why knismesis produces a similar response in many different kinds of animals.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; In a famous example, described in [[Peter Benchley]]'s ''Shark!'', it is possible to tickle the area just under the snout of a [[great white shark]], putting it into a near-[[hypnosis|hypnotic]] [[trance]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623725.500-the-word-knismesis.html The word knismesis] [[New Scientist]], 7 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gargalesis ==
{{wiktionary|gargalesis}}
The gargalesis type of tickle works on [[primate]]s (which include [[human]]s), and possibly on other species.&lt;ref name = "Provine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Provine | first1 = R. R. | year = 1996 | title = Laughter | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 84 | issue = | pages = 38–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ultrasonic vocalizations described as "chirping", which play into social behavior and even have therapeutic effects, are reported in rats in response to human tickling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010728/fob9.asp Science News 2001 - requires signup]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wöhr|first1=M.|last2=Schwarting|first2=R.K.|year=2007|title=Ultrasonic communication in rats: Can playback of 50-kHz calls induce approach behavior?|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=12|pages=e1365|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001365|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panksepp|first1=J.|last2=Burgdorf|first2=J.|year=2003|title="Laughing" rats and the evolutionary antecedents of human joy?|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=79|issue=3|pages=533–547|url=http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Reading/Papers/2003PanBur.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00159-8|pmid=12954448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rygula|first1=R.|last2=Pluta|first2=H.|last3=Popik|first3=P.|year=2012|title=Laughing rats are optimistic|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51959|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051959|pmid=23300582|pmc=3530570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgdorf|first1=J.|last2=Kroes|first2=R.A.|last3=Moskal|first3=J.R.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=Brudzynski|first5=S.M.|last6=Panksepp|first6=J.|year=2008|title=Ultrasonic vocalizations of rats (Rattus norvegicus) during mating, play, and aggression: Behavioral concomitants, relationship to reward, and self-administration of playback|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=357–367|doi=10.1037/a0012889}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, adult female rats may find the tickling sensation adverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paredes-Ramos|first1=P.|last2=Miquel|first2=M.|last3=Manzo|first3=J.|last4=Pfaus|first4=J.G.|last5=López-Meraz|first5=M.L.|last6=Coria-Avila|first6=G.A.|year=2012|title=Tickling in juvenile but not adult female rats conditions sexual partner preference|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=107|issue=1|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the [[nerve]]s involved in transmitting "light" touch and itch differ from those nerves that transmit "heavy" touch, pressure and vibration, it is possible that the difference in sensations produced by the two types of tickle is due to the relative proportion of itch sensation versus touch sensation.&lt;ref name = "Selden"&gt;Selden, Samuel T. (2004): ''Tickle''. J Am Acad Dermatol Vol. 50, No. 1: pp. 93–97.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to trigger a knismesis response in oneself, it is usually impossible to produce '''gargalesthesia''', the gargalesis tickle response, in oneself.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; '''Hypergargalesthesia''' is the condition of extreme sensitivity to tickling.&lt;ref name="Corsini"&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1999): ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. Psychology Press: p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;.  The words knismesis and gargalesis were both used by [[Susie Dent]] in an episode of the BBC game show, [[Would I Lie to You? (game show)|Would I Lie to You?]] (Season 11, episode 4).

This page lists [[Las Vegas Valley]] [[lounge music]] performers.

==Origins of Las Vegas nightlife==
The pioneers of the Las Vegas lounge scene were [[The Mary Kaye Trio]] with [[Mary Kaye]]. Although the lounge existed in Las Vegas hotels, it was not until the trio started the "Dusk til Dawn"{{clarify|date=November 2012|reason=a club?  an act?}} that the nightlife existed in Las Vegas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Many credit [[Louis Prima]] as the original, but the trio started it five years before Prima came to Vegas. Prima and [[Keely Smith]] followed the trio in the origins of Las Vegas nightlife.

A '''mascot race''' is a promotional [[sports entertainment]] or charity competition consisting of costumed runners racing around a [[baseball field]] or race course, usually as a form of between-innings entertainment. The racers are typically [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] inanimate objects or [[mascot]]s related to local culture, a sponsor's products, or sport culture. The outcomes of races can both be decided in a legitimate race or may be predetermined for purely entertainment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10170/1066854-63.stm|title=Out at the plate: Pirates dump outspoken pierogi|author=|date=|work=post-gazette.com|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's largest ever mascot race was the Sue Ryder Mascot Gold Cup held at Wetherby Racecourse in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, on April 26 2015. The race featured 131 mascots with 125 of them completing the {{Convert|1|km|mi}} distance and becoming the new [[Guinness World Record]] for most mascots in a race.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/375286-largest-mascot-race|title=Largest mascot race|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning mascot was the Red Marauder entered by the Ingmanthorpe Racing Stables and helped to victory by Scottish international footballer Gary McAllistair.&lt;ref name=Weatherby&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wetherbynews.co.uk/news/mascot-record-tumbles-at-wetherby-races-1-7233478|title=Mascot record tumbles at Wetherby races|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleveland Indians Hot Dog Race.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cleveland Indians]]' racing hot dogs]]
The best known{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of this type of race is the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]' [[Sausage Race]]. Introduced in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klements.com/racing_sausages/all_started.html&lt;/ref&gt; the race features [[bratwurst]], Polish sausage, Italian sausage, hot dog, and [[chorizo]] characters. The race takes place before the sixth inning of every home game. Players have also been involved; during a 2003 race during a Brewers–[[Pittsburgh Pirates]] game, Pirates slugger [[Randall Simon]] hit one of the sausages with a [[baseball bat]], causing the woman in the costume to require medical care. Milwaukee police fined Simon. The incident subsequently became known as "[[Sausage Race#Randall Simon incident|Sausagegate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/sausagegate/030710.html|title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Police report: Sausagegate|author=|date=|work=go.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sausage Race inspired the creation of the [[Great Pierogi Race]] in Pittsburgh. A rivalry has developed between the Sausages and the Pierogies, and the two groups compete twice yearly in relay races. Another well known{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} mascot race is the [[Presidents Race]] of the [[Washington Nationals]]. [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William Howard Taft]] mascots compete. As a [[Running gag|running joke]], Teddy Roosevelt did not win until the Nationals made the playoffs for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.letteddywin.com/presidents-race-standings/|title=Presidents Race Standings|author=|date=April 7, 2016|work=letteddywin.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Milwaukee Sausages, the Presidents also have a rivalry with the Pierogies.

Other teams have their own versions. The [[Tampa Bay Rays]] have a race sponsored by [[PepsiCo]], the owners of the naming rights to [[Tropicana Field]]. Their race is between large bottles of [[Pepsi]], [[Pepsi Max]], [[Aquafina]], and [[Sierra Mist]]. Before 2007, these were computer-generated. As of 2010, the race is only computer-generated for certain games.

The  [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]] have similar races involving [[hot dogs]]. The Royals' version features live runners dressed as [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] condiments – ketchup, relish and mustard. The live racers made their first appearance during the 2007 season, with the race being limited to the video board prior to this.  The Indians also started a live hot dog race in 2007 with the racers being mustard, onion, and ketchup (who wears thick glasses as a nod to [[Charlie Sheen]]'s "Wild Thing" character from the movie ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]''). In late 2007 the ketchup racer started cutting the corner at home plate to win the race, and this "cheating" has led to several stage skits by players, mascots, and the ground crew to slow or trip him up during the race.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The  [[New York Mets]] race cardboard automobiles. As of May 29, 2016, they include an anthropomorphized police car, fire truck, yellow cab and black limo. As of May 29, 2016, Freddie the Firetruck leads the 2016 series with 9 wins, including the two most recent Sunday races. 

[[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] games feature a live action version of the "Dot Race", in which three dots (Red, Green, and Blue) compete in the middle of the sixth inning. Each fan is given a coupon for [[Ozarka]] bottled water (the race sponsor) that has one of the three colors. A coupon with the "winning color" can be taken to a [[Texas]] store to purchase [[Ozarka]] (in actuality, the coupons do not feature the date they were presented, thus any coupon can be redeemed at any time prior to their expiration date).  The "dots" were later joined by three action figures, all resembling figures in Texas history ([[Davy Crockett]] with his long rifle, [[Jim Bowie]] with his [[Bowie knife]], and [[Sam Houston]]).

The [[Atlanta Braves]] race involves (Atlanta-based) [[Home Depot]]'s hammer, saw (later replaced by a bucket after suffering a serious injury), paint brush, and power drill racing against each other. Before the 2009 season, the race was seen only on the scoreboard, but it now features live runners dressed in costumed versions of these tools; the race takes place on the warning track and starts in right field and ends in front of the scoreboard.

In 2009 the [[San Francisco Giants]] featured periodically a bobble head race with likenesses of announcers [[Duane Kuiper]] and [[Mike Krukow]], but they only occasionally raced in 2009.

The [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] dress three children up in hot dog suits – one representing ketchup, one representing mustard and one representing relish. The three kids run in place in front of the Diamondbacks' dugout while the scoreboard shows a race between the three hot dogs.  The winner receives a prize for their victory.

The [[Houston Astros]]' race involves [[Taco Bell]] hot sauce packets named Fire, Hot, and Mild that race from the right field corner around the outfield and up to the visitors' dugout. This race started in 2010, but starting in the 2015 season the Astros introduced their new race, the Space Race, featuring three dressed in astronauts costume; they are Apollo, Squeeze, and Doc Rocket. Also in 2010, the Arizona Diamondbacks added a "Legends Race&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/ari/fan_forum/legends_race.jsp|title=Legends Race|author=|date=|work=mlb.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;" with {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} likenesses of [[Randy Johnson]], [[Mark Grace]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] and [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]]. The race debuted on July 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100621&amp;content_id=11435062&amp;vkey=pr_ari&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=ari D-backs Reveal Johnson, Gonzalez as First Members of Legends Race], ''arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com'', June 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Diamondbacks previously had a race between live runners dressed as menu items from fast-food chain and sponsor Taco Bell, including a giant cup of [[Pepsi]].  The Mark Grace figure finally won his first race August 8, 2015, on the day Randy Johnson's number was retired; Johnson let him pass him for the win. Mark Grace won another race on October 3, leading the race from beginning to end.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2012, the [[Minnesota Twins]] introduced “The Race at Target Field” mascot race—an evolution of their "Race to Target Field" animated video race which began in 2009 for the inaugural season of [[Target Field]]. The race features five Minnesota-inspired characters: Louie the loon, Wanda the walleye, Babe the blue ox, Skeeta the mosquito and Bullseye the dog (mascot of hometown company and sponsor, [[Target Corporation]]).

Also in 2012, the [[Miami Marlins]] added the Great Sea race featuring Bob the Shark, Julio the Octopus, Angel the Stone Crab and Spike the Sea Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/lists/major-league-baseball-competitive-racing-mascots-gallery-032711#photo-title=The%20Great%20Sea%20Race%252C%20Marlins&amp;photo=30991122|title=MLB's racing mascots|first=Fox|last=Sports|date=|work=foxsports.com|access-date=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2013, the [[Oakland Athletics]] held the first Hall of Famer Big Head race, featuring mascot versions of [[Rickey Henderson]], [[Rollie Fingers]], and [[Dennis Eckersley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://baseballhall.org/discover/short-stops/oakland-athletics-mascot-race|title=Off to the Races|work=baseballhall.org|access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, it is still being run at home games.

The '''Media Diversity Institute''' ('''MDI''') is a London based non-governmental organisation&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Diversity Institute|url=http://www.annalindhfoundation.org/members/media-diversity-institute|website=Anna Lindh Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with the media to improve reporting on ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality and other diversity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Diversity Institute|url=http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/supporters/media-diversity-institute|website=Ethical Journalism Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of MDI is to promote "responsible journalism as a means to improve inter-community relations, increase tolerance and encourage dialogue among individuals and groups coming from different backgrounds."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Diversity Institute|url=https://gfmd.info/en/site/members/886/Media-Diversity-Institute.htm|website=Global Forum for Media Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI has worked with organizations such as [[Internews]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&amp;catId=89&amp;newsId=512|title=Media4Diversity: Taking the Pulse of Diversity in the Media|last=|first=|date=March 2009|publisher=European Commission|year=|isbn=978-92-79-12419-8|location=Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Federation of Journalists]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Article 19]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupar|first1=Verica|title=Getting the Facts Right: Reporting Ethnicity &amp; Religion|date=2012|publisher=MDI &amp; International Federation of Journalists|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Federation of Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MDI is also a member of the [[Ethical Journalism Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporting on Migration and Refugees Training Workshop for EU Journalists|url=http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/reporting-migration-refugees-training-workshop-eu-journalists|website=Ethical Journalism Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
MDI was founded in 1997&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; by journalist Milica Pesic, who was working at the time for NYU Center for War, Peace and the News Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Press Freedom Day 2017|url=http://en.unesco.org/world-press-freedom-day-2017/milica-pesic|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDI works on an international scale, but has a European focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buXzDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media and Cultural Policy in the European Union|last=Kretzschmar|first=Sonja|publisher=Rodopi|year=2007|isbn=9789401204156|editor-last=Sarikakis|editor-first=Katharine|location=Amsterdam|pages=215|chapter=Diverse Journalists in a Diverse Europe?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI works to engage, educate and train the actors in society who have influence over media coverage of diversity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This includes media decision makers (owners, editors, managers), journalists, academics, students, [[Social Movement Organization|Civil Society Organisations]] and governmental organisations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106391301.html|title=European Media Institute Publishes Manuals on Media and Diversity|last=|first=|date=7 August 2003|work=Info-Prod Research|access-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also organize conferences on these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87676017.html|title=Diversity Reporting Program Planned for South Caucasus|last=|first=|date=23 June 2002|work=Info-Prod Research|access-date=5 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
MDI's first large scale media diversity project, The Reporting Diversity Network (RDN), was launched at a conference in November 1998 with keynote speakers [[Michael Ignatieff]] and Jean-Paul Marthoz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuller|first1=David|title=Reporting Diversity Manuel|date=2002|publisher=Media Diversity Institute &amp; European Union|location=London|page=14|url=http://www.cestim.it/argomenti/08media/2002-Reporting-Diversity-Manual-Balkan-EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDN's work focused on Central and Eastern Europe as well as the newly independent former Soviet states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pesic|first1=Milica|title=The Media's Markers of Race and Ethnicity in the Balkans|journal=Rhodes Journalism Review|date=August 2001|volume=2001|issue=20|pages=24–25|url=http://journals.co.za/content/rujr/2001/20/EJC144721;jsessionid=UgRbGlGP3pWXxTOUvp_u967d.sabinetlive}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been involved in addressing the deaths of [[Romani people|Romani]] journalists and editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Peter|date=29 November 2006|title=A Prolegomena to the Study of the Romani Media in Eastern Europe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Gross6/publication/249720670_A_Prolegomena_to_the_Study_of_the_Romani_Media_in_Eastern_Europe/links/56e8191808aea51e7f3b153e/A-Prolegomena-to-the-Study-of-the-Romani-Media-in-Eastern-Europe.pdf|journal=European Journal of Communication|volume=21|issue=4|pages=485|doi=10.1177/0267323106070012|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other projects that MDI have been involved in include Dune Voices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Dune Voices|url=http://www.dune-voices.info/public/index.php/en/about-us/about-dune-voices|website=Dune Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Get the Trolls Out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Counter Hate Speech on Twitter|url=http://www.stoppinghate.getthetrollsout.org/|website=Stopping Hate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Against Hate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Media Against Hate|url=http://europeanjournalists.org/mediaagainsthate/|website=Media Against Hate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
The collaboration between MDI and [[Twitter]] in developing a guide on countering hate speech was referred to in an article in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', October 17, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Madhumita Murgia|first1=Hannah Kuchler|title=Social Media: Challenging the Jihadi Narrative|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3b03edde-8992-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731|agency=Financial Times|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video broadcast produced by MDI's Dune Voices project was published on the BBC website on December 30, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Mali: Artwork from Motorcycle Parts|url=http://www.bbc.com/arabic/media-38470942?SThisFB|website=BBC Arabic|publisher=Dune Sounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MDI contributed to the Journal for Applied Journalism and Media Studies in 2017. MDI’s founder Milica Pesic presented concrete and detailed examples of how MDI has worked to promote inclusive journalism and diversity in the media in many different countries and regions.

The '''Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest''' is an annual American [[hot dog]] [[competitive eating]] competition. It is held each year on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's Famous Corporation]]'s original, and best-known restaurant at the corner of Surf and [[Stillwell Avenue]]s in [[Coney Island]], a  neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].

The contest has gained public attention in recent years due to the stardom of [[Takeru Kobayashi]] and [[Joey Chestnut]]. The defending men's champion is Joey Chestnut, who ate 74 hot dogs in the 2018 contest. The defending women's champion is Miki Sudo, who ate 37 hot dogs in the 2018 contest.

== Rules ==

[[File:Original Nathans.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] original [[Coney Island]] location]]

[[Major League Eating]] (MLE), formerly known as the [[International Federation of Competitive Eating]] (IFOCE), has sanctioned the event since 1997. Today, only entrants currently under contract by MLE can compete in the contest.

The field of about 20 contestants typically includes the following:

* the defending champion;
* winners of a regional qualifying contest for that season;
* individuals qualifying as one of two [[Wild card (sports)|wildcards]] (highest two average qualifier scores without winning a single qualifier); and
* those invited by special invitation of the MLE. ''(See [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest#Controversies|"Controversies" section]] below.)''

The competitors stand on a raised platform behind a long table with drinks and Nathan's Famous hot dogs in buns. Most contestants have water on hand, but other kinds of drinks can and have been used. Condiments are allowed, but usually are not used. The hot dogs are allowed to cool slightly after grilling to prevent possible mouth burns. The contestant that consumes (and keeps down) the most hot dogs and buns (HDB) in ten minutes is declared the winner. The length of the contest has changed over the years, previously 12 minutes, and in some years, only three and a half minutes; since 2008, 10 minutes.

Spectators watch and cheer the eaters on from close proximity. A designated scorekeeper is paired with each contestant, flipping a number board counting each hot dog consumed. Partially eaten hot dogs count and the [[granularity]] of measurement is eighths of a length. Hot dogs still in the mouth at the end of regulation count if they are subsequently swallowed. [[Penalty card#Yellow card|Yellow penalty cards]] can be issued for "messy eating,"&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"&gt;{{Cite episode| title=2011 Hot Dog Eating Contest (Live Television Broadcast)| network= ESPN| airdate = 2011-07-04|series=Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and red penalty cards can be issued for "[[regurgitation (digestion)|reversal of fortune]]", which results in disqualification.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt; If there is a tie, the contestants go to a 5-hot-dog eat-off to see who can eat that many more quickly. Further ties will result in a sudden-death eat-off of eating one more hot dog in the fastest time.

After the winner is declared, a plate showing the number of hot dogs eaten by the winner is brought out for photo opportunities.

==Awards==
The winner of the men's competition is given possession of the coveted international "bejeweled" mustard-yellow belt. The belt is of "unknown age and value" according to IFOCE co-founder George Shea and rests in the country of its owner. In 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] won the inaugural women's competition and its "bejeweled" pink belt.

Various other prizes have been awarded over the years. For example, in 2004 [[Orbitz]] donated a travel package to the winner. Starting in 2007, cash prizes have been awarded to the top finishers.

==History==

The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held at the [[Nathan's Famous|original location]] on [[Coney Island]] most years since about 1972, usually in conjunction with [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts| title=Famous Facts| publisher=Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs| accessdate=December 11, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803005044/http://shop.nathansfamous.com/famousfacts |archivedate = August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan's promoter Mortimer Matz claimed that on July 4, 1916, four immigrants held a hot dog eating contest at Nathan's Famous stand on Coney Island to settle an argument about who was the most [[patriotism|patriotic]]. He also made the spurious claim that the contest has been held each year since then except 1941 ("as a protest to the war in Europe") and 1971 (as a protest to political unrest in the U.S.). A man by the name of Jim Mullen is said to have won the first contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Fagone|date=2007|title=Horsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Y7fSMRrkUEC&amp;pg=PT271&amp;dq=%22Jim+Mullen*+is+the+original+hot-dog+champion.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMkeaBtd3NAhXLOz4KHWytARgQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jim%20Mullen*%20is%20the%20original%20hot-dog%20champion.%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Crown/Archetype (p. 215)}}&lt;/ref&gt; although accounts vary. One account describes [[Jimmy Durante]] (who was ''not'' an immigrant) as competing in that all-immigrant inaugural contest, which was judged by [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Sophie Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America is 204 years old|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bMUPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Wo0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5694%2C528768|work=Boca Raton (Fla.) News (sec. A, p. 2)|date=July 4, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another describes the event as beginning "in 1917, and pitted [[Mae West]]'s father, Jack, against entertainer Eddie Cantor."&lt;ref name="Crown/Archetype (p. 222)"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Fagone|date=2007|title=Horsemen of the Esophagus: Competitive Eating and the Big Fat American Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utR6mUoZBVIC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=%22Rosey+also+elaborated+on+the+contest%27s+backstory%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVjvqlpt3NAhWLMj4KHVBwAMQQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rosey%20also%20elaborated%20on%20the%20contest's%20backstory%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Crown/Archetype (p. 222)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, however, promoter Mortimer "Morty" Matz admitted to having fabricated the legend of the 1916 start date with a man named Max Rosey in the early 1970s as part of a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="NYT 08-18-2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/nyregion/19experience.html |title=No, He Did Not Invent the Publicity Stunt" by Sam Roberts, New York Times, August 18, 2010 | work=The New York Times | date=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend grew over the years, to the point where ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other publications were known to have repeatedly listed 1916 as the inaugural year, although no evidence of the contest exists.&lt;ref name="NYT 08-18-2010"/&gt; As Coney Island is often linked with recreational activities of the summer season, several early contests were held on other holidays associated with summer besides Independence Day; [[Memorial Day]] contests were scheduled for 1972,&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert D. McFadden|date=May 28, 1972|title=Yesterday Was for Traveling, Strolling, Eating and Relaxing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/28/archives/yesterday-was-for-traveling-strolling-eating-and-relaxing.html|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1975,&lt;ref name="New York Times no. 2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Howard Thompson|date=May 26, 1975|title=Going Out Guide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/26/archives/going-out-guide.html|work=New York Times (p. 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1978,&lt;ref name="Ellensburg (Wash.) Daily Record (p. 11)"/&gt;  and a second 1972 event was held on [[Labor Day]].&lt;ref name="St. Joseph (Mo.) News-Press (sec. A, p. 2)"&gt;{{cite web|title=105-Pound Girl Eats 12 Hot Dogs to Win Contest|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AaheAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gVMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=melody%20andorfer&amp;pg=5416%2C216648|work=St. Joseph (Mo.) News-Press (sec. A, p. 2)|date=September 3, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the competition was dominated by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] contestants, particularly [[Takeru Kobayashi]], who won six consecutive contests from 2001-2006. In 2001, Kobayashi transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs—smashing the previous record of 25.5. The Japanese eater introduced advanced eating and training techniques that shattered previous [[competitive eating]] world records. The rise in popularity of the event coincided with the surge in popularity of the worldwide competitive eating circuit.

On July 4, 2011, [[Sonya Thomas]] became the champion of the first Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest for Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitney Holtzman |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/features/article/6721754/nathan-evens-playing-field |title=Nathan's evens playing field |publisher=ESPN |date=2 July 2011| accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, women and men had competed against each other, except for one all-female Memorial Day competition held in 1975.&lt;ref name="New York Times no. 2"/&gt; Eating 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes, Thomas earned the inaugural Pepto-Bismol-sponsored pink belt and won $10,000.&lt;ref name="First Nathan Champ for Women"&gt;{{cite web

In recent years, a considerable amount of pomp and circumstance have surrounded the days leading up to the event, which has become an annual [[spectacle]] of [[Sports entertainment|competitive entertainment]]. The event is presented on an extravagant stage complete with colorful live announcers and an overall party atmosphere. The day before the contest is a public weigh-in with the [[mayor of New York City]]. Some competitors don flamboyant costumes and/or [[makeup]], while others may promote themselves with eating-related [[List of competitive eaters|nicknames]]. On the morning of the event, they have a heralded arrival to Coney Island on the "bus of champions" and are called to the stage individually during introductions. In 2013, six-time defending champion [[Joey Chestnut]] was escorted to the stage in a [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]].

The competition draws many spectators and worldwide press coverage. In 2007, an estimated 50,000 came out to witness the event. In 2004 a three-story-high "Hot Dog Eating Wall of Fame" was erected at the site of the annual contest. The wall lists past winners, and has a digital clock which counts down the minutes until the next contest. Despite substantial damage suffered at [[Nathan's Famous|Nathan's]] due to [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012, the location was repaired, reopened, and the 2013 event was held as scheduled.

ESPN has long enjoyed solid ratings from its broadcast of the Hot Dog Eating Contest on Independence Day, and on July 1, 2014, the network announced it had extended its agreement with [[Major League Eating]] and will broadcast the contest through 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-espn-hot-dog-eating-contest-20140701,0,7676919.story |title=ESPN Locks In Hot Dog Eating Contest through 2024 |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event continues to be recognized for its power as a marketing tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/07/03/nathans-famous-contest-is-fourth-of-july-marketing-magic |title=Nathan's Famous Contest is Fourth of July Marketing Magic |publisher=[[Forbes.com]] |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversies ===

Controversies usually revolve around supposed breaches of rules that are missed by the judges. For example, [[NY1]] television news editor Phil Ellison reviewed taped footage of the 1999 contest and thought that [[Steve Keiner]] started eating at the count of one, but the judge, [[Michael DeVito|Mike DeVito]]—himself the champion of the 1990, 1993, and 1994 contests—was stationed directly in front of Keiner and disputed it, saying it was incorrect. Keiner ate 21 1/2 dogs, as shown on the Wall of Fame located at Nathan's flagship store at the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in Coney Island. This controversy was created by George Shea, the chief publicist for Nathan's, because it created much more publicity for the contest. Shea assured Keiner at the end of the contest that he would clear the confusion up but never did. Keiner never participated in any advertising or contests set up by Shea because of this.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Another controversy occurred in 2003 when former [[National Football League|NFL]] player [[William Perry (American football)|William "The Refrigerator" Perry]] competed as a celebrity contestant. Though he had won a qualifier by eating twelve hot dogs, he ate only four at the contest, stopping after just five minutes. Shea stated that the celebrity contestant experiment will likely not be repeated.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

At the 2007 contest, the results were delayed to review whether defending champion [[Takeru Kobayashi]] had vomited (also known as a "Roman method incident" or "reversal of fortune") in the final seconds of regulation. Such an incident results in the disqualification of the competitor under the rules of the IFOCE. The judges ruled in Kobayashi's favor. A similar incident occurred involving Kobayashi in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/rovell/020704.html |title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Accusations hurled at hot dog contest |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a victory over [[Eric Booker|Eric "Badlands" Booker]].

Takeru Kobayashi has not competed in the contest since 2009 due to his refusal to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating, which is the current sanctioning body of the contest. In 2010, he was arrested by police after attempting to jump on the stage after the contest was over and disrupt the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/415463-chestnut-wins-for-4th-straight-year-kobayashi-arrested|title=Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 2010: Joey Chestnut Wins for Fourth Year|date=4 July 2010|publisher= [[Bleacher Report]]|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/04/2010-07-04_joey_jaws_chestnut_wins_nathans_july_fourth_hot_dog_eating_contest.html|title=Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut Wins Nathan's July Fourth Hot Dog Eating Contest|date=July 4, 2010| work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | accessdate= July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/38086913/ns/sports-othersports/|title=Kobayashi Arrested After Chestnut's Hot Dog Win|date= July 4, 2010|publisher= [[NBC Sports]]|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2010, all charges against Kobayashi were dismissed by a judge in Brooklyn. Despite his six consecutive victories in their annual event, Nathan's removed Kobayashi's image from their "Wall of Fame" in 2011. Kobayashi again refused to compete in 2011, but instead conducted his own hot dog eating exhibition, claiming to have consumed 69 HDB, seven more than Joey Chestnut accomplished in the Nathan's contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weirdnews.aol.com/2011/07/04/joey-chestnut-nathans-2011-hot-dog-contest_n_889722.html#s302839&amp;title=Joey_Chestnut_Wins |title=Takeru Kobayashi Sets World Record With 69 Hot Dogs, Joey Chestnut Wins 2011 Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest |publisher=Weirdnews.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sports website [[Deadspin]] deemed Kobayashi's solo appearance "an improbably perfect 'up yours' to the Nathan's hot dog eating contest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Luke|last=O'Brien|url=http://deadspin.com/5817974 |title=Kobayashi Somehow Sets A New, Totally Unofficial Hot Dog Eating Record |publisher=Deadspin.com |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|&lt;small&gt;The contest was held on June 30 (designated as the 100th anniversary of the invention of the hot dog) and was won by a 400-pound, 32 year old truck driver.

* "Red, White, and Yellow" (1998)
* "A Hot Dog Program: An All-American, Culinary Cruise Through Hot Dog History" (1999)
* "Gut Busters" (2002) Made for TV - [[Discovery Channel]]
* "Footlong" (2002) - not the 2003 short film of the same name
* "The Tsunami - Takeru Kobayashi" (2003) Japanese
* "[[Crazy Legs Conti: Zen and the Art of Competitive Eating]]" (2004)
* "The Most Extreme", "Big Mouths" episode (2004) ([[Animal Planet]])
* ''[[Cheap Seats (TV series)|Cheap Seats]]'', (2004)
* "True Life" (2006) [[MTV]] documentary series
* ''Hungry'' (2013) documentary film; contract dispute between Nathan's Famous and Kobayashi

===Newspapers===
News sources typically use puns in head-lines and copy referring to the contest, such as "'Tsunami' is eating contest's top dog again," "couldn't cut the mustard" ([[Associated Press|A.P.]]), "Nathan's King ready, with relish" (Daily News) and "To be frank, Fridge faces a real hot-dog consumer" ([[ESPN]]).

Reporter [[Gersh Kuntzman]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' has been covering the event since the early 1990s and has been a judge at the competition since 2000. [[Darren Rovell]], of ESPN, has competed in a qualifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=rovell/040507|title=Athletes with appetite|publisher=ESPN.com|first=Darren|last=Rovell|accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactics and training==
Each contestant has his or her own eating method. [[Takeru Kobayashi]] pioneered the "Solomon Method" at his first competition in 2001. The Solomon method consists of breaking each hot dog in half, eating the two halves at once, and then eating the bun.

"Dunking" is the most prominent method used today. Because buns absorb water, many contestants dunk the buns in water and squeeze them to make them easier to swallow, and slide down the throat more efficiently.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt;

Other methods used include the "Carlene Pop," where the competitor jumps up and down while eating, to force the food down to the stomach.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt; "Buns &amp; Roses" is a similar trick, but the eater sways from side to side instead.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt; "Juliet-ing" is a cheating method in which players simply throw the hot dog buns over their shoulders.&lt;ref name="2011 ESPN broadcast"/&gt;

Contestants train and prepare for the event in different ways. Some [[Fasting|fast]], others prefer liquid-only diets before the event. Takeru Kobayashi meditates, drinks water and eats cabbage, then fasts before the event. Several contestants, such as Ed "Cookie" Jarvis, aim to be "hungry, but not too hungry" and have a light breakfast the morning of the event.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

'''[[Entertainment]]''' is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to [[amusement|amuse]] themselves in their [[leisure|leisure time]], and may also provide [[fun]], enjoyment, and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play [[sport]] as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The '''[[Show business|entertainment industry]]''' (informally known as '''show business''' or '''show biz''') is part of the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to [[entertainment]]. However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].  It applies to every aspect of entertainment including [[film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].

'''''Philogelos''''' ({{lang-grc|Φιλόγελως, "Love of Laughter"}}) is the oldest existing collection of [[joke]]s.

The collection is written in Greek, and the language used indicates that it may have been written in the 4th century AD, according to William Berg, an American classics professor.&lt;ref name="DeadParrot"&gt;{{cite news| title = Dead Parrot sketch ancestor found| work = BBC News| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-11-13| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7725079.stm | accessdate =2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to Hierocles and Philagrius, about whom little is known.&lt;ref name=Diatima&gt;{{cite web| last = Quinn| first = John T.| title = 45 Jokes from The Laughter Lover| publisher = Diotima| date = 2001| url = http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/quinn_jokes.shtml | accessdate =2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the celebration of a thousand [[Founding of Rome|years of Rome]] is mentioned in joke 62, the collection perhaps dates from after that event in 248 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Jennings| first = Victoria| title = R.D.

The collection contains 265 jokes categorised into subjects such as teachers and scholars, and eggheads and fools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Laes| first = Christian| title = M.

==Modern day==
In 2008, British TV personality and comedian [[Jim Bowen]] tested the material on a modern audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://compendopedia.com/2012/11/12/philogelos-the-worlds-oldest-surviving-joke-book/{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the jokes in ''Philogelos ''has been described as "an ancestor of Monty Python's famous Dead Parrot comedy sketch."&lt;ref name="DeadParrot" /&gt; Comedian [[Jimmy Carr]] has said that some of the jokes are "strikingly similar" to modern ones.&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2008/11/13/dead-parrot-sketch-is-1600-years-old-145569/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coachella pigstage.jpg|thumb|The giant inflatable pig of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon Live]]'' tour at [[Coachella Music Festival]] on April, 2008.]]

Inflatable [[flying pig]]s were one of the staple [[Theatrical property|prop]]s of [[Pink Floyd]]'s live shows. The first was a sow, but a very obviously male pig appeared in the 1980s. Pigs appeared numerous times in [[concert]]s by the band, promoting concerts and record releases, and on the cover of their 1977 album ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''.

The image rights for the pigs passed to [[Roger Waters]] when he split from the rest of the group,&lt;ref name="Animals Trivia and Quotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/disco/animals/animals_trivia.html |title=Animals Trivia and Quotes |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611194316/http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/disco/animals/animals_trivia.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the pigs continued to be used by both post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and Roger Waters in their gigs.

==''Animals''==
{{see also|Animals (Pink Floyd album)}}
[[File:Battersea Power Station pig 2.jpg|thumb|Algie replica flying over the Battersea Power Station on 26 September 2011]]

The original Pink Floyd pig was designed by Roger Waters and built in December 1976 by the artist [[Jeffrey Shaw]] with help of design team [[Hipgnosis]],&lt;ref name=medienkunstnetz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/pig-for-pink-floyd/|title= Jeffrey Shaw, "Pig for Pink Floyd"|publisher=medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in preparation for shooting the cover of the ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' album. Plans were made to fly the {{convert|40|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}}, [[helium]]-filled [[balloon]] over [[Battersea Power Station]] on the first day's photo-shoot, with a [[marksman]] prepared to shoot the pig down if it broke free.  However, the pig was not launched.

On the second day, the marksman wasn't present because no one had told him to return. The pig broke free due to a strong gust of wind on the third day, gaining a lot of press coverage. It disappeared from sight within five minutes, and was spotted by airline pilots at thirty thousand feet in the air.&lt;ref name=scarfe /&gt; Flights at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] were cancelled as the huge inflatable pig flew through the path of aircraft, eastwards from Britain and out over the [[English Channel]], finally landing on a rural farm in [[Kent]] that night.&lt;ref name=scarfe&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Pink Floyd The Wall|author=Gerald Scarfe|ISBN=978-0-306-81997-1|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig was recovered and repaired for the resumption of photography for the album cover, but the sky was cloudless and blue, thus "boring". However, the pictures of the sky from the first day were suitable; eventually, the album cover was created using a composite of photos from the first and third days.&lt;ref name=superseventies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superseventies.com/floydcvr.html|title= "The Album Covers of Pink Floyd", By Storm Thorgerson, Hipgnosis Design, London.|publisher=superseventies.com|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pig that was originally floated above Battersea Power Station was called "Algie".&lt;ref name=Rollingstone&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20877304/a_pigs_tale_roger_waters_traces_the_history_of_rocks_most_famous_prop |first=Austin|last=Scaggs|date=May 29, 2008|title=A Pig's Tale: Roger Waters Traces the History of Rock's Most Famous Prop |publisher=rollingstone.com |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007102613/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/20877304/a_pigs_tale_roger_waters_traces_the_history_of_rocks_most_famous_prop |archivedate=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pinkfloyd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkfloyd.com/news/index.php|title=Pigs On The Wing (Two Different Ones)...|publisher=pinkfloyd.com|accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Flesh==
After the album ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' was released in [[1977 in music|1977]], Pink Floyd began their "In the Flesh" tour. During concerts, the pig appeared around the [[Public address|PA]] stacks in a cloud of black smoke during performances of "[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]]".

==''The Wall''==
[[File:PinkFloydPig Animals.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Backdrop from a Pink Floyd tour]]
The pig also appeared during each of Pink Floyd's ''[[The Wall]]'' concerts, black instead of pink, with a crossed hammers logo on its side.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Waters would occasionally refer to it directly before "[[Run Like Hell]]" (the pig appeared during the end of the previous song, "[[In the Flesh (Pink Floyd song)|In the Flesh]]"). A short speech in reference to either the pig or the song was given in every show, with each speech being different; this oddity is used by [[bootleg recording|bootleggers]] to identify which date a recording of the Wall tour was made on.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} At the Berlin concert, it was only the head and it had fangs and red eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMr1CKgdCjg |title=The Wall Live Berlin 22 Run Like Hell.flv |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pink Floyd's use of the pig post-Roger Waters==

For the 1987/88/89 tour, the band added testicles to the pig. [[David Gilmour]] has said this was an attempt to get around Roger Waters having the image rights for the pig.&lt;ref name="Animals Trivia and Quotes"/&gt;

Pink Floyd added a 'deflated' pig to Roger Waters's auction of animation art from the film ''[[Pink Floyd—The Wall|The Wall]]'' at [[Christie's]] London on 21 September 1990, the lot was withdrawn before the auction started.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During the 1994 tour, two [[warthog]]-like pigs with protruding tongues were shown at the top of the stage side's speaker towers, sometimes just deflated, sometimes dropped on the ground after "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]". This was also during Pulse, but for the VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases, footage of the pigs falling was edited out.

The pig made another appearance before the release of ''[[Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]]'', when [[Capitol Records]] flew a replica of the original pig from ''Animals'' over the [[Capitol Records Building|Capitol Records Tower]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

One damaged inflatable pig, believed to be from the 1988 [[Pink Floyd]] tour, was repaired by Nga Keith and flown again over a concert by the band [[The String Cheese Incident]] in Austin, Texas on 20 September 2003.  Reportedly purchased by The String Cheese Incident manager Mike Luba from a former Pink Floyd stagehand, the 40-foot pig flew again over the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] audience during a cover of Pink Floyd's "[[Another Brick in the Wall]] (Part II)".

During their [[Live 8]] reunion with Waters, footage of Algie, over Battersea Power Station, was shown on a giant video screen behind the band.

A replica of Algie was tethered above Battersea Power Station on 26 September 2011 to promote the [[Why Pink Floyd...?]] campaign, involving the reissue of the band's first 14 studio albums.

==Roger Waters solo tours==
{{main|Inflatable pigs on Roger Waters' tours}}
[[File:PinkFloydPig.JPG|thumb|An inflatable pig released at the Roger Waters show on June, 2007.]]

* During a concert in Summerfest 2006, the pig had a message printed on it reading "Impeach [[George W. Bush|Bush]]"
* In a concert in [[Argentina]] on 2007, a pig flew and ended up on the [[Río de la Plata]].
* At Argentina tour dates in 2007, the pig had the "Nunca Más" (Never again) inscription on its chest, referring to the famous slogan with which the Argentine people referred to the Dictatorship when 30,000 people "disappeared" and were killed in the 1970s.
* During Waters' performance at the 2008 [[Coachella Festival]], one of the giant inflatable pigs being used as a prop became untethered and floated away into the California desert. Organizers of the festival had offered a $10,000 reward plus free lifetime tickets to the festival in return for the pig's recovery.  The pig was found three days later at a nearby country club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydesert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080429/NEWS01/80429001/1006 Pig found in La Quinta country club]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Likewise, during the concert in Dallas, TX on 2 May 2008, and Houston, TX on 4 May, the pig floated away.
* During a concert in Chicago on June 8, 2012 at Wrigley Field, the pig crashed into the crowd behind home plate and was ripped to pieces by the crowd.
* During his "Us + Them" tour in 2017, the pig had a message printed on it reading "PIGGY BANK OF WAR" and underneath printed "BOMBS AND DEATH COME FROM HERE" with an arrow pointed toward to pigs rear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-roger-waters-emasculate-trump-with-pigs-at-rehearsal-w483510 See Roger Waters Emasculate Donald Trump With 'Pigs' at Tour Rehearsal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestclassicbands.com/roger-waters-concert-review-2017-5-22-17/ Roger Waters Reminds Fans Who ‘Us’ + ‘Them’ Are]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Pink Floyd's inflatable pig can be seen floating above [[Battersea Power Station]] in the 2010 movie ''[[Nanny McPhee Returns]]'' as the nanny and children make a motorcycle trip to London to locate the children's father.
*Pink Floyd's Inflatable pig can also be seen floating outside [[Battersea Power Station]] in the 2006 movie ''[[Children of Men]]''.
*Inflatable pigs can sometimes be spotted floating around neighborhoods in 2004 video game ''[[The Sims 2]]''.
*In the 1996 ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[Homerpalooza]]" a cannon fires an inflatable pig, which [[Peter Frampton]] claimed to have bought at a Pink Floyd yard sale, at [[Homer Simpson]]. Publicity for the UK release of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' in 2007 also mimicked the original ''Animals'' cover shoot, with a giant inflatable version of the film's [[Spiderpig]] character flown above Battersea.
*During the "Isles of Wonder" short film shot by [[Danny Boyle]] and shown as part of the Opening Ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the camera zooms down the length of the Thames River, from a small spring in the countryside all the way to the Olympic venue.

==Plot==
{{main|List of Rosario + Vampire characters}}
[[File:Yokai Academy.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Yokai Academy, the main setting of ''Rosario + Vampire'']]
[[Tsukune Aono]] is an average teenager who is unable to get into any local high schools due to his poor grades. As a last ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named [[Moka Akashiya]], who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the [[rosary|rosario]] around Moka's neck, and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality.

Because of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including a succubus [[Kurumu Kurono]] and a child prodigy witch [[Yukari Sendo]]. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, [[Ruby Tojo]], who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet [[Mizore Shirayuki]], a [[yuki-onna|snow fairy]] student who becomes Tsukune's "stalker". A group of "[[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Monstrels|Monstrels]]" harass the club, causing Moka to transfuse blood into Tsukune to the point where he turns into a [[ghoul]]. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Anti-Schoolers|Anti-Schoolers]] threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporary closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room.

In ''Rosario+Vampire: Season II'', Moka's younger sister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Koko Shuzen|Koko Shuzen]] enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Fairy Tale|Fairy Tale]], which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#San Otonashi|San Otonashi]], a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Fangfang Huang|Fangfang Huang]] tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her rosario fixed.

At Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Akasha Bloodriver|Akasha Bloodriver]], who sacrificed herself to protect them from [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]], the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest sister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Aqua Shuzen|Aqua]] infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Tohofuhai|Tohofuhai]] to handle the upcoming challenges.

Tsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Gyokuro Shuzen|Gyokuro Shuzen]], who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her sisters Aqua and [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Kahlua Shuzen|Kalua]]. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Masked King|Masked King]] reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo.

Moka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve, however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it.

== Conception ==
Ikeda drew inspiration from the monster manga series ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'' and has incorporated some references later into the first serialization of the ''Rosario+Vampire'' manga. In an interview at [[Lucca Comics &amp; Games|Lucca Comics]] 2012, Ikeda said he is a big fan of [[Tim Burton]] and was inspired by his works, including ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and particularly ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' because the monster has a sensitive soul. His first character design was Moka, a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck; he then created the school of monsters and Tsukune afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements. After the series ended in ''[[Monthly Shōnen Jump]]'' but was going to be featured in ''[[Jump Square]]'', he retitled the second series to give it a sense of renewal.&lt;ref name="nanodainterview"&gt;{{cite web|first=Shinji |last=Kakaroth | publisher = Web Agency Meta Line |url=http://www.nanoda.com/gp-publishing-intervista-akihisa-ikeda/ |title=GP Publishing: Intervista ad Akihisa Ikeda | language = Italian | work=Nanoda.com |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Warner of Mania.com gave volumes 1 through 3 of ''Season II'' ratings between B+ and A-. In his review for volume 1, he felt the first part was a bit weak with "predictable and bland stories," but remarked positively on the volume's cover art and artwork in general, especially the character artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-01_article_121263.html | title= Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #01 | publisher= Mania | date= June 28, 2010 | accessdate= September 28, 2011 | last= Warner | first= Matthew | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131215210125/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-01_article_121263.html | archivedate= December 15, 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second volume, he said it was better focusing on two stories and while noting the second story with [[Kokoa Shuzen|Kokoa]] was weaker, it still delivers “quite a few solid laughs" and helps develop her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-02_article_123466.html | title= Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #02 | publisher= Mania | date= August 12, 2010 | accessdate= September 28, 2011 | last= Warner | first= Matthew | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121011075525/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-02_article_123466.html | archivedate= October 11, 2012 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for volume 3, he stated while it starts out slow, he really enjoyed the story with Mizore, specifically the character development and seeing the characters put aside their disagreements for a common goal: to save Mizore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-03_article_127579.html | title=Rosario+Vampire Season 2 Vol. #03 | publisher=Mania | date=March 11, 2011 | accessdate=September 28, 2011 | author=Warner, Matthew | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224050205/http://www.mania.com/rosariovampire-season-2-vol-03_article_127579.html | archivedate=December 24, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave volumes of ''Season II'' an A- rating.

In volume 11, he changed his overall view and deemed it solidly a battle manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/rosariovampireseasontwo011.html |title= Rosario+Vampire: Season II Volume 11 manga review |work= Comic Book Bin |date= 2013-03-05 | first=Leroy | last= Douresseaux |accessdate= 2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

In its original sense, a '''shaggy dog story''' or '''yarn''' is an extremely long-winded [[anecdote]] characterized by extensive narration of typically [[Non sequitur (literary device)|irrelevant incidents]] and terminated by an [[Anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] or a pointless punchline.

Shaggy dog stories play upon the audience's preconceptions of joke-telling. The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|title=Jokes|page=8|author=Ted Cohen|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-11230-6|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to be funny : an extremely silly guidebook|year=1978|author=Jovial Bob Stine|publisher= Dutton |isbn=0-525-32410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of their delivery is reflected in the [[English language|English]] [[idiom]] ''[[wiktionary:spin a yarn|spin a yarn]]'', by way of [[analogy]] with the production of [[yarn]].

==Archetypal story==

The commonly believed [[archetype]] of the shaggy dog story is a story that concerns a [[wikt:shaggy|shaggy]] dog.  The story builds up, repeatedly emphasizing how shaggy the dog is. At the climax of the story, someone in the story reacts with, "That dog's not so shaggy." The expectations of the audience that have been built up by the presentation of the story, that the story will end with a punchline, are thus disappointed. Ted Cohen gives the following example of this story:&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

{{quote|A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess.  When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions.  The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: "He's not that shaggy."}}

However, authorities disagree as to whether this particular story is the archetype after which the category is named.  [[Eric Partridge]], for example, provides a very different story, as do William and Mary Morris in ''The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''.

According to Partridge and the Morrises, the archetypical shaggy dog story involves an advertisement placed in the ''Times'' announcing a search for a shaggy dog. In the Partridge story, an aristocratic family living in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is searching for a lost dog, and an American answers the advertisement with a shaggy dog that he has found and personally brought across the Atlantic, only to be received by the butler at the end of the story who takes one look at the dog and shuts the door in his face, saying, "But not so shaggy as ''that'', sir!" In the Morris story, the advertiser is organizing a competition to find the shaggiest dog in the world, and after a lengthy exposition of the search for such a dog, a winner is presented to the aristocratic instigator of the competition, who says, "I don't think he's so shaggy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secret of Humor|author=Leonard Feinberg|year=1978|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-6203-370-9|pages=181&amp;ndash;182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaggy Dog Story|work=World Wide Words|author=Michael Quinion|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sha1.htm|date=19 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
===Mark Twain and the story of grandfather's old ram===
A typical shaggy dog story occurs in [[Mark Twain]]'s book about his travels west, ''[[Roughing It]]''. Twain's friends encourage him to go find a man called Jim Blaine when he is properly drunk, and ask him to tell "the stirring story about his grandfather's old ram."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_story.html |title=The Story of Grandfather's Old Ram |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=26 September 2013 |author=Twain, Mark |author-link=Samuel Clemons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain, encouraged by his friends who have already heard the story, finally finds Blaine, an old silver miner, who sets out to tell Twain and his friends the tale. Blaine starts out with the ram ("There never was a bullier old ram than what he was"), and goes on for four more mostly dull but occasionally hilarious unparagraphed pages.

Along the way, Blaine tells many stories, each of which connects back to the one before by some tenuous thread, and none of which has to do with the old ram. Among these stories are: a tale of boiled missionaries; of a lady who borrows a false eye, a peg leg, and the wig of a coffin-salesman's wife; and a final tale of a man who gets caught in machinery at a carpet factory and whose "widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in&amp;nbsp;..." As Blaine tells the story of the carpet man's funeral, he begins to fall asleep, and Twain, looking around, sees his friends "suffocating with suppressed laughter." They now inform him that "at a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep [Blaine] from setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram — and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had heard him get, concerning it."

===Isaac Asimov and the story of the Shah Guido G. ===
In the collection of stories by [[Isaac Asimov]] titled ''[[Buy Jupiter and Other Stories]]'', is a story titled "[[Shah Guido G.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Asimov, Isaac |author-link=Isaac Asimov |title=Buy Jupiter and other stories'', |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York, NY |year=1975 |pages=33–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his background notes, Asimov identifies the tale as a shaggy dog story, and explains that the title is a play on "shaggy dog".

'''''Slapping the Table in Amazement''''' ({{zh|初刻拍案驚奇}}) is a collection of [[vernacular]] short stories, written by [[Ling Mengchu]] (1580–1644). It was composed in the middle of the 17th century during the end of [[Ming Dynasty]]. It involves 78 stories in all and is divided into two parts: the first and the second ('''''Er Pai''''' for short) {{zh|二拍}}. There are forty stories in each part. ''Slapping the Table in Amazement'' contains many different stories, such as folk legends, romances and unofficial history.

Thanks to the prosperity of commodity economy and social progress. ''Er Pai'' expresses [[mercantilism]], and open values of love and marriage. At the same time, there are many out dated ideas in this book, such as  [[feudalism]] and [[superstition]], [[:wikt:comeuppance|comeuppance]] and ideas of [[fatalism]], along with some explicit love scenes. Moreover, the author attacked the peasant uprisings toward the end of [[Qing Dynasty]] in some articles.The novel is remarkable not only for its stunning storylines, but also for its precise and detailed observation of the life and social structures typical of 17th-century Chinese aristocracy.

''Er Pai'' together with the three masterpieces of [[Feng Menglong]] (1574–1646; a Chinese vernacular writer and poet of the late Ming Dynasty) is called ''San Yan Er Pai''.  They are representative works of the stories of Ming Dynasty. ''San Yan'' is distinguished by its strong artistic charm, while ''Er Pai'' vividly describes public life and expresses civil consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of China''(April, 1992, the first edition) Chinese literature, Chinese opera, page 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early copies==
The original copy of this volume has been lost, however the earliest and most complete print copy (尚友堂刊本, missing the 23rd episode) is safely treasured at a temple in Japan (日本栃木県日光市輪王寺慈眼堂).  Amazing Tales-Second series, urged by Ling’s publican and published after completion in 1932, contains 39 stand-alone short stories (1 from Chunqiu Time, 14 from Song Dynasty, 3 from Yuan Dynasty, 19 from Ming Dynasty, and the final 2 remained unknown) and 1 performance script (Zaju, a type of performance originated in Tang Dynasty) .  Due to the loss of the 23rd episode in the first volume, modern publicans replaced it with the same numeric numbered episode from the second volume, when combined, the two volumes together contain a total of 78 short stories plus 1 performance script. Note that the English publicans only translated a few so-found the greatest-hit episodes in each volume, and their commercial release is not a complete collection of the Er Pai.

==Artistic features==
'''''Slapping the Table in Amazement''''' vividly represented life at that time, created in 1627. The sales volume reached an all-time high.
In art, he by the succinct writing style, has portrayed vivid characters, narrated twists and turns of details. He thought: people nowadays just know that ghosts and monsters, which can’t be seen or heard, were astounding. But they ignore that, in our daily life there are many spooky things, which can be detected, but can’t be explained with common sense. Capturing extraordinary things in ordinary life, by absorbing readers, is the key to his success.

“script for story-telling （话本）”originated from “story-telling（说话）” in Tang Dynasty, which means telling stories, and it prevailed in Song Dynasty. Script for story-telling played as the outline of the story for the storyteller to tell the whole story to the audience. The readers and listeners were all the common people, so it was the literary catered to ordinary people. “Er Pai”, as a vernacular novel, was more close to the public life and ideas at that time
He expressed his profound ideas about the society in a vivid way. What is more, opposition of the shackles of personality and praise of the pursuit of  the young for love are the themes.

Based on the foundation of traditional aesthetics, "Er Pai" also keeps on trying to explore the new way of art. It has shown a unique, individual artistic face, that makes itself a treasure of ancient colloquial short stories.&lt;ref&gt;''Master and Masterpiece'' (published by Jinan Press, first published in Sep, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
The novel is composed in [[written vernacular Chinese]] rather than [[classical Chinese]].

==Involved in==
The ancient narrative literature, as the Medieval Literature, describe the emperor and hero’s deeds. While, in many chapters of ''Er Pai'', the most described are the merchants of Huizhou, person carrying loads, hawkers, prostitutes, people, who are playing Chinese chess, thieves, and such lower figures. It reflects the new change of social ethics with the development of commodity economy.
It also describes the licentious stories of many Taoists and Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;preface of ''Slapping the Table in Amazement'', by Huang Tianji, published Sep 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
The author put emphasis on the social effect of his work. He selected material from the common events in the public life, so as to reveal the true and the false and ugly. In such a society of that time where there was more evil than good, it helped people to get psychological balance, when they found in the novel that bad person did not get good results. For example, in the very beginning of the eighth volume: People are all afraid of robbers, but it’s a pity that everywhere we can find them.  If an official does not correctly use his power, bringing calamity to the country and people, while enjoying high salary, isn’t he a robber? That’s why his work was so popular among the ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;''The second collection of Striking the Table in Amazement'' published by People's Literature Publishing House, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
In Chinese ancient literature, the meaning of existence of every single person can be confessed only by his social relationships. For all his psychologys, wills, desires are considered into a common framework, it is hard to describe anything disordinary about the cockles of the heart of hero. Therefore, a passport to an excellent character is to descript actions, instead of depicting psychological processes. Placing emphasis on plots, drawing figures’ descriptions in a straightforward style, focusing attentions by complex stories, are important marks of Chinese ancient novels and storiettes.
When it comes to structure, usually, the beginning and the ending are corresponding with each other. The appearance of a character is always accompanied with introductions of his place of origin and personal identity, and his parents’ origins and identities. At the end the author would clear the endings of the hero and his offspring.

'''''Slapping the Table in Amazement''''' and '''''The second collection of striking the Table in Amazement ''''' of Ling MengChu (凌濛初) in thought and artistic style tendency are the same. People used to call these two books "Er Pai". The "Er Pai" as eponymous as the "San Yan"( three books of Feng MengLong (冯梦龙) : ''Yu Shi Ming Yan'' (喻世明言) 、''Jing Shi Tong Yan'' (警世通言) 、 ''Xing Shi Heng Yan'' (醒世恒言) ) . "Er Pai" was made a big difference by "San Yan" . Withal, Ling MengChu made no attempt to conceal the truth, he said:" works only by Feng MengLong were the most artistic, and broke corrupt customs of the society in that time. " Ling MengChu wrote "Er Pai" as well as broke corrupt customs of the society in that time.&lt;ref&gt;Foreword of ''Slapping the table in amazement''&lt;/ref&gt;

"Er Pai" and "San Yan" are still different. "San Yan" collected and processed scripts for story-telling (in Song、Yuan and Ming dynasty folk literature). Though there were scripts of Feng MengLong in ''San Yan'', the proportion was very small.&lt;ref&gt;''Material of "San Yan" and "Er Pai"' by Tan ZhengBi (谭正璧)&lt;/ref&gt;"Er Pai" mainly wrote by Ling MengChu. His works were abbreviated and based on fact, but more lively and decorative than "San Yan".&lt;ref&gt;''The second collection of striking the Table in Amazement'' published by People's Literature Publishing House, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slow Media''' is a [[media consumption]] movement that opposes the high rate of [[Mass media|media]] production and consumption in the [[digital age]]. It advocates for media that is thoroughly researched and widely accessible, not limited by the time necessary to produce or observe the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=|url=http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow media developed in response to complex media formats and instant communication methods characteristic of [[cyberculture|digital culture]], in which "high volumes of information are updated in real-time and are perpetually at your fingertips." (Jolly, 2014) &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=|url=http://archives.cjr.org/news_literacy/slow_news_news_diet.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of slow media criticize the spheres in which media is produced, shared, and consumed as valuing tempo and dramatic presentation over the substance and credibility of a work, in order to [[Attention economy|draw the attention]] of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/news-media-social-media-information-overload.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=|url=http://archives.cjr.org/news_literacy/slow_news_news_diet.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stage managers panel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the Part of a freak is stage manager's panel, or "[[Prompt corner]]."]]'''Stage management''' is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and &amp;nbsp;coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

A '''Stage Manager''' is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or "'''Production Stage Manager'''", and one or more '''Assistant Stage Managers'''.

==History==

The title of Stage Manager was not used until the 18th century. Though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.

Moving into the Middle Ages there is evidence of a Conducteurs De Secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines, this was a common practice of the time. 

Between the Renaissance and 17th century the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. During the Elizabethan and Jacobean Theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: Stage Keeper and Book Keeper. The Stage Keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The Book Keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects.  

Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.

Though it wasn't until the 18th century in England that the term Stage Manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions—''director'' and ''stage manager''.&lt;ref name="Fazio"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fazio| first = Larry| title = Stage Manager: The Professional Experience| isbn = 0-240-80410-4| publisher = [[Focal Press]]| pages = 367| date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director [[Preston Sturges]], for example, was employed as an ASM on [[Isadora Duncan]]'s production of ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' at the age of 16 and a half:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}}, p. 123-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later [[Brock Pemberton]] hired him as an ASM on [[Antoinette Perry]]'s production of ''Goin' Home'', which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, ''[[The Guinea Pig (play)|The Guinea Pig]]'', in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sturges}} pp. 239-245&lt;/ref&gt;

** Texting/Calling
*** The stage manager may need to text or call actors or crew members to give them reminders or check up on them if they are late for a call time.
** Email
*** Email can be useful for communication between production departments, sending reminders to cast and crew, or distribution of rehearsal reports and other materials
**** The SM might utilize a feedback loop - ask the recipients to reply to show they have received and understand the information
***** "Communication without feedback isn't communication, it's broadcasting." - Ed Baker
** Headset/walkie talkies
*** During tech, dress rehearsals, and the run of the show, the Stage Manager may need to be on headset to call cues and communicate with lights, sound, and any Assistant Stage Managers
** Call board
*** The call board might be an actual bulletin board backstage, or an electronic message board.  Usually the sign-in sheet for actors and crew will be located on the call board

=== Prompt Book ===
The prompt book contains the script from which the SM calls the show, labeled with light and sound cues.  It may also contain:
* Shift plot for props
* A pre-show schedule
* A pre-show checklist
* Light and sound cue breakdowns
* Rehearsal schedules
* Rehearsal and performance reports
* Confidential emergency health history
* Cast and crew contact sheet

*

== Regional differences ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, ''Stage Manager'' is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as ''the stage manager''. Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled Production Stage Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant Stage Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as ''Production Stage Manager'' (first or head stage manager), ''Stage Manager'' (second stage manager), and ''Assistant Stage Manager'' (third stage manager).&lt;ref name=Fazio /&gt;

Some professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the [[Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A [[fringe theatre]] show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a [[West End theatre]] show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the [[British Actors' Equity Association]], which also represents performers.

====Deputy stage manager====
The DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Pallin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assistant stage manager====
The assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.

==Show control based venues==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
Many live shows around the world are produced with the forehand knowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. Often, they are on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, [[show control]] systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.

== Different Areas of Stage Management ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
The role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are Opera, Music and Dance concerts and, Film and Television.

For music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.

== Stage Managers and Unions ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2018}}
With being a Stage Manager you also need to know what unions you will be working with. Some of the things that a Stage Manager needs to know about working with a union is how often do they take breaks, and who is represented by which union. 
=== Actors Equity Association ===
Commonly referred to as [[Actors Equity]] (AEA). Actors Equity represents the stage actors and stage managers in the live theatre industry. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living  conditions, livable wages, and benefits.
=== IATSE ===
[[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE) represents the stage hands in the theatre.
=== United Scenic Artists ===
[[United Scenic Artist]] also known as United Scenic Artists of America. It organizes designers, artists and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries.&lt;ref&gt;United Scenic Artists is affiliated with International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees since 1999.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' syndicated comic strips were printed daily in newspapers from 1928 to 1970. They were originally created by John Hix. ''Strange as It Seems'' was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources.

It was syndicated domestically by [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] and internationally by [[United Press International]]. At its peak the strip was printed in 1,300 newspapers. The cartoons competed in newspapers with ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' cartoons. Other similar strips at the time included Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'' and ''[[It Happened in Canada]]'' by Gordon Johnston.

By 1953, the strip's syndication was down to 175 newspapers. The demise of multiple newspapers in cities and the changing taste of readers led to the strip ending in 1970.

The cartoon strip was written and drawn by John Hix from 1928 until his health began to deteriorate in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby began drawing the strip, although Hix continued to oversee and approve all content.

John Hix died of [[myocarditis]] on June 6, 1944 (which was also [[D-Day]]). His brother, Ernest Hix, took over producing the feature. The cartoons were drawn by Dick Kirby from 1944 to 1946, then by Doug Heyes from 1946 to 1948. After Ernest Hix's death in the crash of a private plane on September 18, 1948, in Los Angeles, the writing of the strip was taken over by his wife Elsie Huber Hix. Ms. Hix had two young children at the time, Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Dixie Ann Hix. Dick Kirby returned to draw the strip from 1948 until 1949, then George Jahns took over and continued as the feature's artist until 1970 when the strip was discontinued. Ms. Hix continued to write the stories for the comics until 1963, when she turned the work over to her son, Ernest Hix, Jr. He wrote and produced the strip with his wife Phyllis until 1970 when the feature went out of syndication.

==Radio show==
''Strange as It Seems'' was a radio program of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, based on the daily syndicated newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. ''Strange as It Seems'' began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee Coast]] radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer [[daylight saving time]]). The sponsor was [[Ex‐Lax]]. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the ''Strange as It Seems'' stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by [[Gayne Whitman]], produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts from 1930–1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as "butterflies smell with their feet" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16" [[33 RPM]] records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program was picked up as a 30-minute network program on the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] from August 17, 1939 to December 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight saving time). There were 72 broadcasts of these 1⁄2 hour broadcasts. The sponsor was [[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive Shave Cream]] and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. ''Stranger Than Fiction'' was the successor to the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction #2 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified.

===Gayne Whitman (announcer 1935–1939)===
Alfred Vosburgh was born March 19, 1890 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He first used the stage name of Alfred Whitman when he began acting in silent films in 1917. He later used the stage name [[Gayne Whitman]], beginning in 1925. He was an American radio and film actor. On radio, he played the title role in Chandu the Magician and was an announcer on other programs. He appeared in 213 films between 1904 and 1957. His wife was the former Estelle Allen. Whitman died on August 31, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA of a heart attack.

===Gordon "Felix" Mills (musical director (1935–1939)===
Gordon 'Felix' Mills was born on July 28, 1901 in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He was a highly successful composer-arranger-conductor during the [[Golden Age of Radio]] in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the musical director for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]'', a Disney radio show of the 1930s. Mills created a "gadget band" with wild instruments for Donald Duck to direct on some episodes.

He was also the musical director for CBS Radio's ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]'' from 1937 to 1947. Choosing to retire rather than fire a few band members during the Red Inquisition, he built a home in Morro Bay, California to pursue his favorite hobbies, sailing and slide photography. Mills died on April 5, 1987 at Morro Bay, California.

===Cyril Armbrister (producer and director 1935–1939)===
Cyril Edward Armbrister was born on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]] on August 24, 1896. His ancestors had been British loyalists during the Revolutionary War and immigrated to the Bahamas in the late 1700s. His father, William Armbrister, married for a second time at the age of 76 to Eugenie Bode and Cyril was born of this marriage. His father died when Cyril was 12 and he and his mother moved to Canada. Cyril was educated in England and was a captain in the Canadian Militia during World War I. He later moved to Hollywood and became a director. He directed ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', [[Terry and the Pirates (radio serial)|''Terry and the Pirates'']], and [[Land of the Lost (radio)|''Land of the Lost'']], among other radio programs. He married the actress Frances Fintel and they split their time between California and the family plantation on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]]. Cyril's son Tony developed the family plantation into the resort, Fernandez Bay. Cyril died on September 18, 1966 in Nassau, Bahamas.

===Alois Havrilla (announcer 1939‐1940)===
Alois Havrilla was born June 7, 1891 in Presov, Slovakia. He arrived in the United States as a small child, speaking no English. He worked hard to perfect his English. He began his radio career as a baritone singer. In 1921, he recorded, "Tancuj, Tancuj," a well-known Slovak folk song. He then worked as an announcer on the ''[[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive]] Hour'' on [[NBC]] from 1927 to 1931. He also worked as an announcer on several other radio programs, including ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in 1934–1935 and the [[Paul Whiteman]] radio program. In 1935, he received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], the prestigious Medal for Good Diction and was named as the country's best radio announcer. He also worked as a narrator for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]] Pictorial and Pathe Motion Picture Studios. Havrilla worked at a number of New York-area radio stations as a news commentator, announcer, narrator, and host of musical programs. He died on December 7, 1952 in Englewood, New Jersey.

==Film shorts==
[[Warner Brothers]] released a series of short films beginning in May 1930 based on Robert Ripley's ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'' cartoon series. [[Universal Studios]] responded by signing John Hix to a contract to create short films based on his cartoon strip ''Strange as It Seems''. There were 39 short subjects released between August 22, 1930 and May 5, 1934, coming out on average about once per month. The films were produced by [[Jerry Fairbanks]] &amp; Manny Nathan, scripted by John Hix and narrated by [[Gayne Whitman]].&lt;ref name="SAIS1"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183823/ Strange as It Seems #1 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The first 21 released in 1930 were produced in Multicolor. Beginning in September, 1932, the remaining 17 shorts were filmed in Black &amp; White. The shorts played in over 6,000 movie theaters. When Jerry Fairbanks left Universal for rival Paramount, (starting their ''[[Popular Science|Popular Science (film)]]'' films, his ''Strange as It Seems'' series was taken over by the [[Universal Studios]] newsreel staff with Thomas Mead and Joseph O'Brien in charge and renamed ''Stranger Than Fiction''. The first of these films was released on June 28, 1934 and came out about every 2 to 3 weeks. They were also filmed in black and white and were directed by Charles E. Ford and narrated by Alois Havrilla &amp; James Wallington.&lt;ref name="STF2"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on Sept. 18, 1940, the films were directed by Henry Clay Bate and narrated by Alois Havrilla.&lt;ref name="STF70"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1556701/ Stranger Than Fiction (1940) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films was released on August 31, 1942, for a total of 110 ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films and a total of 149 short films, including the ''Stranger than Fiction'' series. Columbia Studios brought back the ''Strange as It Seems'' shorts in 1937. CBS bundled 8 of these shorts in a package to their television affiliates in 1949.

==Books==
The first ''Strange as It Seems'' book was published in 1931 and reprinted many of the cartoons from the three-year run of the newspaper feature. In December 1936, [[Eastern Color Printing]] published the ''John Hix Scrapbook''. In 1937, Eastern released a second volume.

There was also a hardback written by Elsie Huber Hix in 1945 and a follow-up paperback. Each sold over 500,000 copies. She published two more paperbacks, with the final one published in 1962.

==Comic books==
Comic books were a natural medium for these cartoons. The first of these comic books appeared in 1932. Promotional comic books were created for [[Ex-Lax]] (as a promotional giveaway on the radio program they sponsored) and [[United Airlines]] (as a handout for passengers to read on the flights). A series of comics began in 1939, with issues 2 – 9 being published.

==Exhibitions==
The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935. But by that fall, the promoters knew they needed to make changes. Areas like [[Gold Gulch]] (a replica of an 1849 Gold Rush town) and the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] were getting out of hand and generating bad publicity while the ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome, so the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was very popular. John Hix drew from his large collection of oddities for the Exhibition in the large building in the center of the Fun Zone. Then in 1939, the Hix brothers aced out Robert Ripley for an exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ripley responded with his own exhibition near the Fair and named it ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorrium''. A series of the Odditoriums would eventually be created around the world. A 1938 newspaper article described the groundbreaking of the exhibit at the World's Fair "61 Year old Shovel. Auspiciously performing groundbreaking ceremonies for the John Hix "Strange as It Seems" show at the New York World's Fairground on December 30, 1938, Grover Whalen, President of the Fair, used a shovel invented 61 years before – on April 16, 1878 – by G. B. DeForest, embodying construction principles still in use. Betty Broadbent was one of the persons at the Hix's attraction. Her body was covered almost entirely with over 450 tattoos.

==Archives==
The ''Strange as It Seems'' archives are maintained by Jeff Hix, grandnephew of John Hix and the son of Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. and are currently being digitized by HistoriVision, LLC. to be made available to the public for reference as well as for use in the ''Strange as It Seems'' productions currently published on their website and [[YouTube]] channel. According to the [http://www.strangeasitseems.com ''Strange as It Seems'' website], the archives are a "40 year treasure trove of fascinating letters and photos from the world over confirming the strange and unusual stories in sports, science, popular culture, history and nature delivered daily to its faithful readership throughout the 1930's, 40's, 50's &amp; 60's."

==Ripley vs. Hix==
Robert Ripley of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' and John Hix of ''Strange as It Seems'' competed on many media fronts in acquiring and accumulating the most original and strange facts for their projects. There was always a friendly rivalry between Ripley and Hix in their various media offerings: 
*Robert Ripley was 16 years older than John Hix so he had a head start based on his age.
*In 1918, Robert Ripley began publishing his cartoons in newspapers. John Hix began nationally syndicating his newspaper cartoons in 1928, ten years later. 
*In April 1930, Ripley aired his first radio show; Hix started his ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program in March, 1935. 
*In May 1930, Ripley released his first movie shorts through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]]. 3 months later in August 1930, Hix released his first film shorts through [[Universal Studios]]. 
*Ripley was selected for an exhibit at the [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in 1935. Hix replaced him with an exhibit at the show in 1936. 
*And in 1939, Hix scooped Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. Ripley countered by opening the first of his Ripley's Odditoriums a few blocks from the fair.

They also competed in book and comic book publishing as well.

John McCary Hix was born on June 17, 1907 in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to John Harmon Hix and Viola Ann McCary Hix. His brother Ernest Harmon Hix was born on September 13, 1902. Before World War I, the family first located to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], then [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. John Harmon Hix was a traveling salesman and moved his family to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], where their third child, a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, was born in August 1918.

At an early age, John McCary Hix had a strong urge to draw. He drew unflattering caricatures of his teachers which often got him into trouble. Eventually his cartooning paid off and his drawings appeared in the ''Nautilus'', the Greenville High School newspaper. While in school, John took a job with the ''Greenville Daily News'' as a staff artist for $5 a week.
He was also a delivery boy on his bicycle, which earned him $7 a week. His dog Pal, a shaggy black and white half-[[collie]] and half-[[Water spaniel]], followed him everywhere on his deliveries. John trained Pal to drop papers on the doorsteps of one side of street while he delivered the other. He got up every morning at 3:00 AM and was at the newspaper office by 4:00 AM. He was also the local agent for several magazines, selling them as well. 

He studied cartooning through a correspondence course, since there were no art schools nearby. When his father died on March 5, 1926 of heart failure, John was in his senior year of school. After graduation from Greenville High School in May 1926 (he has a plaque on the Greenville High School Wall of Fame),{{cn|date=November 2018}} John decided he wanted bigger things and applied to the ''[[Washington Herald]]'' newspaper as an editorial cartoonist. He got the job and moved to Washington, D.C., where he was paid $15 a week. While in Washington D.C., he attended a few classes at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design|Corcoran School of Art]]. 

He also started a daily one-column comic strip called ''Hicks by Hix'', featuring various wise-cracking [[Yokel|hick]] characters. It was syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate]].  The strip did very well and was syndicated to several newspapers. This success lead to a job with [[McClure Syndicate|McClure Newspapers]] in New York City. He illustrated a new strip called ''[[Frank Merriwell|Young Frank Merriwell]]'', written by [[Gilbert Patten]].&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2006/05/frank-merriwell-bulletin.html Stripper's Guide: A Frank Merriwell Bulletin!], May 30th, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted on March 26, 1928 and ran for 6 months (the comic strip was resurrected in July 1931 as ''Frank Merriwell's Schooldays'' and ran for three years, this time illustrated by Jack Wilhelm).&lt;ref name=Frank /&gt; He also created a strip called ''[[O. Henry]]'s Short Stories''.&lt;ref name="OHenry"&gt;[https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/09/obscurity-of-day-o-henrys-short-stories.html "Obscurity of the Day: O. Henry's Short Stories,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (October 05, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he attended a few classes at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York. His dream was to attend the [[Yale School of Art]] where several of his art school classmates were attending, but there was not the money for that so most of John's art training was learned on the job.

''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'', drawn by Robert Ripley began syndication in 1918. It contained many fantastic claims, which were not always verified. In 1927, John conceived the idea of ''Strange as It Seems'' and in December of that year, he signed a contract with The [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] in New York City, making him the nation's youngest nationally syndicated artist at only 20 years old. The cartoon was announced for syndication by McClure in February 1928 and debuted on March 28, 1928 in about 50 newspapers, the same day ''Young Frank Merriwell'' debuted. The cartoon was one panel with several illustrations of strange and unusual people, places and events. The feature required much more than just drawing as countless hours of research were required for the ideas and to verify their authenticity. Hix advertised widely that all of his claims were verified by at least three sources. He even included a notation on his cartoons, "If you doubt this, write for proof to the author." In the May 20, 1929 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, it was erroneously reported that the comic had debuted the previous week. A letter to the editor three weeks later from Harold Matson, Managing Editor of the syndicate, corrected the timing of the cartoons publication dates. ''Time'' compared Hix to Ripley with this observation: "Cartoonist Hix does not seem quite so able with his pencil as Cartoonist Ripley. Astounder Ripley, after nine years, does not seem quite so astounding as fresh Astounder Hix."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In the January 4, 1930 edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine, Hix announced that in early February 1930, ''Strange as It Seems'' would be expanded to include a full page Sunday color edition. The comic was being carried in over 80 newspapers by this time. John was now drawing a daily panel plus a Sunday color panel, a full 365 cartoons a year. As the cartoon grew in popularity and distribution spread into more papers, fans began mailing John ideas for the feature. To verify the story ideas, John would correspond with educators, scientists, civic workers and historians from around the world for photographs and documentation of authenticity. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Hix rarely traveled for his ideas, but relied on correspondence for verification and had built a repository of 50,000–60,000 usable ideas ready to be incorporated into his cartoons. The claim that drew the most requests for proof of authenticity was that [[George Washington]] was the eighth president of the United States and that he was born on February 11, not February 22. The cartoons were often accompanied by several paragraphs of explanation in an article next to the cartoon.

John Hix continued to live in Washington D.C. and is listed in the 1930 U.S. Census as living on New Hampshire Avenue, a couple of houses down from the rest of his family.
''Strange as It Seems'' became immensely popular and there were many opportunities for expanding the feature. John's brother Ernest Hix became his business manager and together they recognized the possibilities of turning the ''Strange as It Seems'' cartoons into a multi-media empire, especially after Ripley's ''[[Believe It Or Not!]]'' cartoons were transformed into live action movie shorts for [[Paramount Studios]] beginning in May 1930. 

[[Universal Studios]] offered John Hix an opportunity to create movie shorts for their studio and the first ''Strange as It Seems'' short was released on August 22, 1930. The shorts would eventually play in over 6,000 movie theaters across the country. Like the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney brothers]] a decade before them, the Hix brothers relocated their feature to [[Hollywood, California]], in 1931. In 1931, a hardback book of the cartoon stories was released. The first of many comic books with the cartoons in them appeared in 1932. In May 1932, the cartoon was in over 150 newspapers. By November 1932, the cartoons were appearing in England, China and Japan.

In the spring of 1935, John Hix turned his cartoons into a successful 15-minute radio program on the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee network]]. Beginning on Sept. 13, 1936, ''The John Hix Scrapbook'' was released as half of the syndicated Sunday Color full page cartoon. In September 1939, the radio show became a 30-minute program broadcast weekly over the CBS network for 72 weeks. Over 600 radio programs were eventually created. The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935 with an exhibit of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]''. But by the end of that year, exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome. So the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was immensely popular. In 1939, the Hix brothers outmaneuvered Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. 

In its heyday, it was reported that the ''Strange as It Seems'' comic strip was syndicated in over 1,300 newspapers. John Hix enjoyed people questioning the authenticity of his stories and continued to invite them to write for proof in each cartoon, a feature that became the centerpiece for many of his promotional newspaper articles. During World War II, John worked with the [[Office of Emergency Management]] to incorporate 70 ideas they supplied into his comics to help the war effort.

John's health began failing in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby took over the drawing of ''Strange as It Seems'', but Hix still reviewed all of the cartoons prior to publication.

On Monday evening, June 5, 1944, John Hix collapsed against a car, gashing his head in front of a hotel on Ivar Ave. He was taken to his home by his physician and died the following morning, June 6, 1944 ([[D-Day]]). The cause of death was a heart attack caused by myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle due to a viral infection). He was only 11 days shy of his 37th birthday. On June 8, 1944, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced that there would be a private service coordinated by [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries|Forest Lawn]] Mortuary. John was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA]]. His plot is in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Hall of Memory, Columbarium of Memory, Niche 19608. He had no wife or children.

===Ernest Hix===
Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. was born September 13, 1902 in Huntsville, Alabama. After he moved to Washington D.C. with his family in the 1920s, he met and married Elsie Huber in 1932. Ernest became the business manager of the "Strange as It Seems" business and helped to create a multi-media empire of cartoons, movies shorts, books, comics, radio programs and exhibitions. He relocated with his brother, mother, sister and wife to Los Angeles in the 1930s. In 1942, he shared an office with his brother, John, at 6362 Haywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA and his residence was on Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA. Ernest took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' creative business after John Hix died suddenly in 1944. Besides continuing to write the daily syndicated cartoon, Ernest revived the radio show, as a transcribed 15 minute program in 1947. The program ran until his death on September 18, 1948 in a private plane crash, shortly after take-off from the Newhall Airport north of Los Angeles.

The plane's owner, Eugene Joseff, had been warned not to take off until a fog lifted, but he took off anyway. The plane crashed and burst into flames after circling the field. Beside Ernest Hix and Eugene Joseff, there were two other persons killed in the plane crash: John M. Lacey, the pilot and Wilmer F. Pemberton, a designer.
Joseff was the maker and supplier of about 90% of the ornate jewelry used in motion pictures at the time. After his death, Hix's wife Elsie took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' work.

===Elsie Hix===
Elsie Elizabeth Huber was born Nov. 11, 1902 in Allentown, PA.  Her parents were John and Anna Lowe Huber, both born in Germany.

{{nihongo|'''''Suki na Mono wa Suki Dakara Shōganai!!'''''|好きなものは好きだからしょうがない!!|}}, also known as '''''Sukisho!''''' or ''Sukisyo!'' is a [[light novel]] that has since expanded into a [[Yaoi|Boys' Love game]] (a type of [[Visual Novel]]), an [[anime]] series and [[OVA]].  The title translates into [[English language|English]] as "I like what I like, so it can't be helped", or "I like what I like, so there!"  The best known of the versions is the BL game, which features mild BL, and, in the original PC release, hardcore BL. The story is owned by SOFTPAL and Platinum Label, and the illustrations to the novels and games is by [[Tsutae Yuzu]].

==Plot==
High-school student Sora Hashiba was hospitalized after falling from the fourth floor of the school building. On his first night back in the [[dormitory]], he wakes to find a strange boy addressing him by the name "Yoru". The stranger identifies himself as "Ran"  and says he's Sora's new roommate. The next day, Sora's childhood friend and dorm manager, Matsuri Honjou, informs Sora that the other boy, whom Matsuri identifies as Sunao Fujimori or "Nao-kun," is actually another childhood friend of Sora. Sora doesn't remember meeting Sunao before. In fact, Sora can't remember much of anything regarding his past, and the series follows his quest to regain his memory.

Sora soon learns why Sunao identified himself as "Ran" that first night: he and Sora have [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]]. Sora's is Yoru, a powerful protector and the lover of the more dependent, feminized Ran. The existence of these alternate personalities, and the relationship between them, has some mysterious connection with Sora's fall from the window and his forgotten past. The alternate personalities' passionate relationship is a far cry from the hostility and distrust between Sora and Sunao. Because Yoru and Ran possess them arbitrarily, Sora and Sunao frequently find themselves in embarrassing situations when they regain control of their minds.

Other comical situations arise from Matsuri's efforts to draw Sora and Sunao into his moneymaking schemes, known as the group "The School Do-It-Alls" and from such minor characters as a [[bishōnen]] ghost and three younger boys who resemble the trio. No parents are ever mentioned, and the only authority figures are school nurse Kai Nanami and math teacher Shin-ichirou Minato, but it is known that Sora and Sunao are both orphans. Both have some connection with Sora and Sunao's dark past, which also involves one of the older students at the school, Kai Nagase, and a mysterious doctor named Aizawa.

==Characters==
;{{Nihongo|'''Sora Hashiba'''|羽柴 空|Hashiba Sora}}
:Voiced by: [[Hikaru Midorikawa]], Rika Higashino (child)
The main character of ''Sukisho''. Sora can't remember his past and at first doesn't know he has an alternate personality named Yoru. Sora has spiky blue hair, blue eyes, and is usually easy going, and also loves to eat. As a dominant male, he has a complicated and occasionally hostile relationship with his roommate and former childhood friend Sunao Fujimori. Normally, he refers to Sunao by his last name, Fujimori. Sora also seems to be the character most often harmed in the anime. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Yoru'''|夜|Yoru}}
:Voiced by: [[Takehito Koyasu]]
Sora's alternate personality. Unlike Sora, Yoru is both shrewd and flirtatious. He is considered the [[Yaoi#Seme and uke|seme]] of the couple. Yoru loves Ran, but he isn't above flirting with anyone. He loves Ran and will often show it when in bed with him (which embarrasses  Sunao in the aftermath). However, Yoru will protect Sora when he feels a need. In the game, he also likes to joke around with Sora by placing images of Sora's friends in odd positions (including Sunao and Ran, Hiromu, Nanami, and oddly enough, Yoru himself). Yoru can be distinguished from Sora by his slightly darker hair, increased height, deeper voice and a glowing amber left eye. He is also usually seen with a long white piece of cloth tied to his right arm. In one of the drama CDs it is said that he tried to kill himself because he left Ran in the lab, and wears the white cloth as a memento. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Sunao Fujimori'''|藤守 直|Fujimori Sunao}}
:Voiced by: [[Souichirou Hoshi]], Madoka Akita (child)
Sunao is Sora's childhood friend and current roommate. Sunao has long pink hair usually tied with a long piece of red ribbon and pink eyes, and an alternate personality named Ran. Easily angered, he isn't above punching anyone who makes him lose his temper, especially Sora, who he punches a few times in the beginning of the anime series. At first, he claims he hates Sora, but he becomes closer to Sora with each game/episode, eventually consummating his relationship with Sora. Just as Sora calls Sunao by his last name, Sunao refers to Sora as Hashiba; in some episodes, Sunao calls Sora by the childhood nickname of "Kuu-chan" instead. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Ran'''|らん|Ran}}
:Voiced by: [[Kappei Yamaguchi]] (Game/Drama CD), Souichirou Hoshi (anime)
Just as Sora has Yoru, Sunao also has an alternate personality, named Ran (蘭), which is Japanese for orchid. Ran is dependent, demanding and in some cases more feminine than Sunao. Ran is the [[Yaoi|uke]] of the pairing, and loves Yoru to the point of an obsession. He will occasionally flirt with Sora only to bring out Yoru. Ran can be distinguished from Sunao by his slightly brighter pink hair color (in the game), higher voice, and red eyes; in the anime, the red eyes are the only feature the two personalities don't share. Unlike Yoru, Ran never harasses Sunao, though he will attempt to seduce anyone else. Note that Kappei Yamaguchi is the voice actor for Ran in the Drama CD and games, but the same voice actor (Hoshi Souichirou) plays both Sunao and Ran the anime. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Matsuri Honjou'''|本城 祭|Honjō Matsuri}}
:Voiced by: [[Susumu Chiba]], Chiro Kanzaki (child)
A close childhood friend of both Sora and Sunao, Matsuri has long blond hair and green eyes. The dorm manager and head of the Do-It-All Club (in the anime), Matsuri always carries a camera, frequently taking fun (if embarrassing for Sora) snapshots. He's an upbeat person who likes to tease his friends, often inventing elaborate plans usually revolving around getting Sora and Sunao together, or making money. Sora and Sunao rarely like any of Matsuri's ideas, but the pair tends to go along with Matsuri despite that. Note that the Jack-of-All-Trades club that Matsuri establishes in the anime does not exist in the games. Also, he resembles Saotome Haruna from ''[[Mahou Sensei Negima]]'' in both image (Long hair with antennae) and ''Paru sama'' personality + Kazumi paparazzi.

;{{Nihongo|'''Kai Nanami'''|七海 かい|Nanami Kai}}
:Voiced by: [[Akira Ishida]]
The school nurse. Nanami is possibly the most feminine character in Sukisho (second most feminine would probably be Ran). The perfect housewife, Nanami cooks and cleans with a smile on his face. He lives with Shin-ichirou, whom he is in love with (they are seen sharing the same bed in the anime and the dramas show them to be married). He is very nice and easy to talk to, although he is constantly haunted with guilt because of his past where he worked with Aizawa conducting immoral experiments on humans in an effort to help Shin-ichiro with his own mental condition. There is hardly any difference between the games and the anime when concerning Nanami, but in the games he tends to be slightly more high strung (he can and WILL punch Shin-ichirou when he feels the need for it). Nanami has brown shoulder length hair (may be slightly longer) and blue eyes. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Shin-ichirou Minato'''|水都 真一朗|Minato Shin'ichirō}}
:Voiced by: [[Shinichirou Miki]]
The school math teacher. He loves Nanami and cares very much for Sora and Sunao (who often refer to him as 'nii-chan'or "brother" though they are not blood related). Usually, Shin-ichirou is very easy going and somewhat immature, though caring. He will often flirt with Nanami, but most of the time in a playful way. He is, however, very prone to jealousy and he also has another side of him often referred to as 'Minato' or 'Minato-sensei'. As Minato, he is very flirtatious and will attempt to force people into sex (often Sora or Nanami). Usually, Nanami just has to mess up Minato's hair or punch him to bring back Shin-ichirou. In White Flower, Minato acts more evil and becomes Aizawa's slave after being brainwashed. Shin-ichirou has black spiky hair and blue eyes. As Minato, his hair is a lot more tidy and sometimes his eyes are pitch black. 

;{{Nihongo|'''Gaku Ichikawa'''|市川 学|Ichigawa Gaku}}
:Voiced by: [[Atsushi Kisaichi]]
Sora's friend, he is a year younger than Sora. He has a crush on Nagase Kai, manager of the Chemistry labs. He seems to be always happy, and he tries to help his friend any way he can. A sincere boy of pure feelings, Sora says that "He expresses four times more his feelings than the majority of the people". In the game ''Mou Matte'', Gaku is given the position of main character and must choose to either continue his relationship with Nagase (as the uke, or bottom) or start a new one with Shiina (as the seme, or top). 

;{{Nihongo|'''Kai Nagase'''|永瀬 芥|Nagase Kai}}
:Voiced by: [[Ryoutarou Okiayu]]
He is the chemistry lab manager. A quiet, serious and mysterious man, yet he is very intelligent and has gotten his thesis printed in numerous science magazines. Gaku is in love with him, admires him and is always praising him whenever he can. Nagase knows this, and takes advantage of this when needed. But finally, he changed because of Gaku's true love. He is the son of Professor Aizawa, the main antagonist. 

;Sei, Ren Shiina, and Fuuta Kitamura 
:Voiced by: [[Kouki Miyata]] (Sei), Chiro Kanzaki (Ren, anime), [[Motoki Takagi]] (Ren, OVA), [[Yu Kobayashi]] (Fuuta, anime), [[Takahiro Sakurai]] (Fuuta, OVA)
Three children who have become attached to Sora, Sunao, and the rest. It is unknown if Sei and Shiina have parents, but Kitamura has become Hano Yoshihiro's stepbrother (which he resents in the anime). Sei resembles Sora while Shiina resembles a young Nanami. Kitamura does not really resemble anyone, but fans have said he somewhat resembles Sunao due to his hot pink hair. After episode 3, they are never seen apart and seem to act identical for most of the series (except in episode 13, the OVA). In the games, their personalities are a lot more diverse and they are very similar Sora, Sunao, and Matsuri when they were in school. Sei acts the most immature of three (Sora), Kitamura comes up with various plans and likes to joke around (Matsuri), and Shiina tends to be the more effeminate tsundere (Sunao). They also live together in the same dorms. In the games and their teacher is Sora. Although not exactly related, Sei is sometimes seen as Sora and Sunao's child. In the games, Shiina also has a crush on Gaku and whether or not he ends up with Gaku depends on the player's choice (in both White Flower and Mou Matte). Kitamura can also end up with Gaku, but only in Mou Matte. In the game Sei is Sora's clone. He cannot speak first, but starts to trust Sunao and Sora after a while. After White Flower, the three of them are like a family. Ren (蓮) or (恋) means 'lotus' or 'romance, love' in Japanese. 

;Kano
:Voiced by: Michiru Yamazaki
The adopted child of Ayano. He is really shy and unexpressive, seems to be a chibi-Gaku as Sei-kun to Sora (chibi-Sora). The first time he smiled was when Ayano used his favourite plushie (a pink rabbit) to talk to him. Since then, Ayano always brings it with him. In the games and novels, Aizawa made Kano out of DNA from Gaku Ichikawa as he admired Gaku's cheerfulness. 

;Soushi Asaka
:Voiced by: [[Yuji Ueda]]
Occasionally appears in the game and makes brief appearances in the anime. Soushi is a lawyer who loves to flirt with Nanami. Most of the time, he playfully flirts with Nanami just to anger Shin-ichirou. Compared to most of the character, he acts a lot more refined, but he will occasionally get mad (especially if children are making too much noise). In the games, there are scenes where he and Sora have sex (depending on the choices the player makes). The PS2 game and the Drama CDs show that Soushi and Matsuri could become a couple. He is also the middle brother of Shin-ichirou Minato and Ryouya Kozuki. 

;Ryouya Kozuki
:Voiced by: [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]
Shin-ichirou's and Soushi's older brother. He has a psychiatric clinic and he does double-personalities-analysis to Sora and to Sunao (with Soushi's and Nanami's approval, though the same can not be said for Sora and Sunao). He brings always with him a pink rabbit and does ventriloquism with it to his adopted child, Kano-kun (seemingly a bit unexpressive and shy enough). Smiles often and loves children. In the games, he originally worked for Aizawa. 

;Hiromu Sakura
:Voiced by: [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]
A young boy who loves Sora (later on he loves Sunao in the game). He gets into an accident that puts him into the hospital. He then becomes a wandering spirit, but what he does differs between the anime and the games. In the anime, Hiromu haunts the halls of the school to find Sora. In the games, he possesses Sunao and tries to spend time with Sora (this is indicated by Sunao's sudden hair color change to white and the playful tune in the background). Hiromu acts very innocent and playful. Eventually, his spirit returns to his body. In First Limit, Sora can end up with Hiromu if the players makes the right choices. 

;Yoshihiro Hano
:Voiced by: [[Kenji Nojima]]
Gaku Ichikawa's classmate, and is also close to Fuuta Kitamura. He is cheerful and enjoys chemistry, just like Gaku, and is the step brother of Fuuta Kitamura. In the games and novels, he has an obsession with putting pink bows in his hair. 

;Chris
:Voiced by: [[Hiro Yuuki]]
A character appearing only in the games and the OVA, he is a young boy who works at a nearby church and has a very close relationship with Sora Hashiba. In Target Nights, he became friends with Sora, but ended almost killing Sora and Sunao because he said that Sora was possessed. Later, it is revealed that Aizawa manipulated his feelings to get revenge on Nanami (who was Chris real target) to which Chris apologies. Chris also has a love interest in Nanami, the two where close friends when Nanami worked for Aizawa in the laboratory. On the next games, he became a recurring character and a real friend of Sora and his friends.  

;Aizawa
:Voiced by: [[Jūrōta Kosugi]]
Aizawa is the main antagonist in Sukisho. He is a professor at the university which Sunao attends after the games, and the chemistry department advisor. Aizawa is obsessed with studying medicine and cloning and even invented medicine that can control the mind and emotions of human beings. Aizawa grew up with and became friends with Shin-ichirou Minato and Kai Nanami. Aizawa struggled with psychological issues, unable to function properly in public, and had issues handling his emotions. Aizawa had begun falling in love with Shin-ichirou Minato but failed to cope with such emotions. As he entered high school, he switched schools and Kai Nanami wound up working and studying under him by college so he can help Shin-ichirou with his schizophrenia but left after Aizawa attacked him. Aizawa became obsessed with causing Nanami pain and shortly after, kidnapped Sora Hashiba and Sunao Fujimori and had performed grotesque experiments on them when they were children. Aizawa has three "sons" whom are all clones by the names Nagase Kai, Cano, and Ren Shiina. Aizawa cannot also feel pain physically. Despite Aizawa being cold and collective, he is usually hyper and fun around Gaku Ichikawa and Nagase Kai. Aizawa deeply cares about the people around him, but due to his emotional disability, has issues showing so. Shin-ichirou's brother Ayano winds up working for him, claiming Aizawa was very depressed and lonely. Most of Aizawa's hate towards Nanami is mostly due to jealousy. By the end of the games, Aizawa redeems himself and happily works as a professor again, leaving the main characters alone. It's implied him and Ayano become a couple.

==Games==
Currently, there are four games and one spin-off in the ''Sukisho'' series. The games were originally point-and-click visual novels released for PC, containing sexual content, though certain body parts are censored (as is all pornographic material in Japan).

Three of the games have been released on the Sony [[PlayStation 2]]. The PS2 versions have been heavily edited and many new CG scenes have been added. In addition, they feature the voice acting from the Drama CD cast, which were absent in the PC release. These games do not yet have an official English translation.

===''First Limit''===
The first game in the series. Sora Hashiba was put into the hospital for quite some time after falling from one of the school buildings. He didn't receive any major injuries, but he has lost some of his memories in the process. However, he continually sees a vision of him being carried through several dark corridors and the voice of someone calling out to him. After being released from the hospital, Sora heads back to the dorms to find that a new boy by the name of Sunao Fujimori, who will now be his roommate. He is told that Sunao is his childhood friend, but he cannot recall spending his childhood with Sunao. As he spends time with Sunao, he notices some strange things about him, including his transformation into his alternate personality Ran. On top of that, the spirit of a hospitalized schoolmate possesses Sunao and confesses his love for him. Depending on the player's decisions, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Hiromu, Ran, or Minato.

===''Target Nights''===
After spending some time in Shin-ichirou and Nanami's place, Sora and Sunao come across a mysterious cosplaying bandit known only by the number 416. He claims that he has come to take away something precious from Sora. Meanwhile, Sora and Sunao meet Chris, who works at the nearby church. While he seems harmless, he begins to spend more time with Sora. To top it all off, Sora begins to realize that there are times when he and Sunao are mysteriously in bed together. He already knows about Sunao's connection with his alternate personality Ran, but could that mean he has his own alternate personality as well? Depending on the choices of the player, Sora will either end up with Sunao, Chris, Ran, Matsuri, or Minato. Also, obtaining all the CGs rewards the player with a special ending involving bandits 416, 773, and most recently 848.

===''Rain''===
Possibly the turning point in the series. Sora and Sunao continue their life in school. All seems normal until Sora notices a child that looks very similar to himself. Also, some of his schoolmates are beginning to act a little strange. Even Sora begins to notice that something odd about his connection to Sunao and the relationship between their alternate personalities Yoru and Ran. Depending on the choices of the player, Sora may end up with Sunao, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. Collecting all the CGs allows the player to access secret endings that involve Sora, Sunao, Matsuri, Shin-ichirou, and Nanami banding together as cosplaying bandits 848, 370, 332, 416, and 773.

''Sukisho'' cast's status prior to ''White Flower'':

*'''Sora:''' Working as a teacher in the nearby school (which is no longer an all-boys school).
*'''Sunao:''' Has been missing since ''Rain''. Said to be working for Aizawa.
*'''Matsuri:''' Working in an animal shelter (needs to be confirmed).
*'''Shin-ichirou:''' Has been missing since ''Rain''.
*'''Nanami:''' Still the school nurse
*'''Sei and Kitamura:''' Students in Sora's class
*'''Gaku:''' Still working with Nagase in the chemistry labs, but no longer as a student
*'''Nagase:''' Still chemistry lab manager
*'''Hiromu:''' Working as a model with Kirito Nakahara
*'''Chris:''' Still working at the nearby church
*'''Soushi:''' Still a lawyer.
*'''Professor Aizawa:''' Has been missing since ''Rain''. Said to have taken Sunao and Shin-ichirou with him.

===''White Flower''===
The final game in the series. Taking place a couple of years after ''Rain'', many changes have been made to the school. Not only is it no longer an all-boys school, several of the former students are now working as teachers while others move onto other jobs. Sora, as one of the teachers, has been living a fairly normal life as he takes Minato's place as teacher. However, he realizes that it won't stay normal for long when he sees that Sunao, who he has not seen since the events in ''Rain'', reappears in one of the halls. This game finally wraps up the story between Sora and Sunao and ends their conflict with Professor Aizawa. Depending on the player's choices, Sora can either end up with Sunao, Nanami, Hiromu, Matsuri, Soushi, or Minato. There are two hidden endings in this game. The Yoru/Ran ending is received when achieving the true ending, while the Kaito ending is obtained when all the CGs are collected.

===''Mou Matte''===
A spin off of the ''Sukisho'' games. Takes place some time in between ''Rain'' and ''White Flower''. The player now controls Gaku Ichikawa, one of Sora's friends who worked in the Chemistry Lab. Gaku must now choose whether to continue his relationship with Kai Nagase or start a new one with Ren Shiina. Depending on the player's choice, Gaku may end up with Shiina, Nagase, or Kitamura. Most of the main cast from the previous ''Sukisho'' games are visibly absent, including Sora and Sunao. Of the original cast, only Gaku, Nagase, Shiina, Kitamura, Nanami, Nakahara, and Hano make appearances.

'''''The Hunger Games''''' is a [[trilogy]] of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novels written by American novelist [[Suzanne Collins]]. The series is set in [[The Hunger Games universe|''The Hunger Games'' universe]], and follows young characters [[Katniss Everdeen]] and [[Peeta Mellark]].

The novels in the trilogy are titled [[The Hunger Games (novel)|''The Hunger Games'']] (2008), ''[[Catching Fire]]'' (2009), and ''[[Mockingjay]]'' (2010). The novels have all been developed into [[The Hunger Games (film series)|films]] starring [[Jennifer Lawrence]], with the film adaptation of ''Mockingjay'' split into two parts. The first two books in the series were both [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best sellers]], and ''Mockingjay'' topped all US bestseller lists upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Children's Books | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date= December 27, 2009 | accessdate=December 31, 2009 | first=Gregory | last=Cowles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Mockingjay Tops All National Bestseller Lists with Sales of More Than 450,000 Copies in its First Week of Publication | url=http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/node/363 | publisher=Scholastic | date=September 2, 2010 | accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time [[The Hunger Games (film)|the film adaptation]] of ''The Hunger Games'' was released in 2012, the publisher had reported over 26 million ''Hunger Games'' trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Karen | last=Springen | title=The Hunger Games Franchise: The Odds Seem Ever in Its Favor | url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/51167-the-hunger-games-franchise-the-odds-seem-ever-in-its-favor.html | newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] | date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hunger Games'' universe is a [[dystopia]] set in [[The Hunger Games universe#Panem|Panem]], a country consisting of the wealthy Capitol and 12 districts in varying states of poverty. Every year, children from the districts are selected to participate in a compulsory televised [[battle royal]]e death match called [[The Hunger Games universe#The Hunger Games|The Hunger Games]].

The novels were all well received. In August 2012, the series ranked second, exceeded only by the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series in [[NPR]]'s poll of the top 100 teen novels, which asked voters to choose their favorite young adult books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/07/157795366/your-favorites-100-best-ever-teen-novels |title=Your Favorites: 100 Best-Ever Teen Novels| publisher=NPR | date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=August 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 2012, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] announced ''The Hunger Games'' trilogy as its top seller, surpassing the record previously held by the ''Harry Potter'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/amazon-crowns-hunger-games-as-its-top-seller-surpassing-harry-potter-series/ | work=The New York Times | first=Julie | last=Bosman | title=Amazon Crowns 'Hunger Games' as Its Top Seller, Surpassing Harry Potter Series | date=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014}}, the trilogy has sold more than 65 million copies in the U.S. alone (more than 28 million copies of ''The Hunger Games'', more than 19 million copies of ''Catching Fire'', and more than 18 million copies of ''Mockingjay'').

==Setting==
{{Main|Fictional universe of The Hunger Games}}
''The Hunger Games'' trilogy takes place in an unspecified future time, in the dystopian, [[Apocalypse|post-apocalyptic]] nation of Panem, located in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|title=The Hunger Games|year=2008|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|isbn=0-439-02348-3| page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country consists of a wealthy Capitol city, located in the [[Rocky Mountains]],&lt;ref name="HG_41"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|title=The Hunger Games|year=2008|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]]|isbn=0-439-02348-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is lavishly rich and technologically advanced, but the districts are in varying states of poverty. The trilogy's narrator and protagonist [[Katniss Everdeen]], lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem, located in [[Appalachia]],&lt;ref name="HG_41"/&gt; where people regularly die of starvation. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the "Dark Days"), in which District 13 was supposedly destroyed, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining districts, between the ages of 12 and 18, are selected by lottery to compete in an annual pageant called the Hunger Games. The Games are a televised event in which the participants, called "tributes", are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The winning tribute and his/her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies, and riches. The purposes of the Hunger Games are to provide entertainment for the Capitol and to remind the districts of the Capitol's power and lack of [[remorse]],
[[forgetfulness]], and [[forgiveness]] for the failed rebellion of the current competitors' ancestors.

===Structure===
Each book in ''The Hunger Games'' trilogy has three sections of nine chapters each. Collins has said this format comes from her playwriting background, which taught her to write in a [[three-act structure]]; her previous series, ''[[The Underland Chronicles]]'', was written in the same way. She sees each group of nine chapters as a separate part of the story, and comments still call those divisions "act breaks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Collins |first=Suzanne |title=Similarities To Underland |url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/similarities-to-underland.htm |type=Interview: Video |work=[[Scholastic Canada]] |accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Collins says she drew inspiration for the series from both classical and contemporary sources. Her main classical source of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] is the Greek myth of [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]], in which, as a punishment for past crimes, [[Minos]] forces [[Athens]] to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to the Minotaur, which kills them in a vast [[labyrinth]]. Collins says that even as a child, she was stunned by the idea since "it was just so cruel" to force Athens to sacrifice its own children.

Collins also cites as a classical inspiration the Roman [[gladiator]] games. She feels three key elements create a good game: an all powerful and ruthless government, people forced to fight to the death, and the game's role as a source of popular entertainment.&lt;ref name="classical"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/classical-inspiration.htm |title=Video: Classical Inspiration – The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|publisher=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary source of inspiration was Collins' recent fascination with [[Reality TV|reality television programs]]. She says they are like ''The Hunger Games'' because the Games are not just entertainment but also a reminder to the districts of their rebellion. On a tired night, Collins says that while she was channel-surfing the television, she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the [[Iraq War]]. She described how the two combined in an "unsettling way" to create her first ideas for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/videos/contemporary-inspiration.htm|title=Video: Contemporary Inspiration – The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trilogy==
===''The Hunger Games''===
{{Main|The Hunger Games (novel)}}
''The Hunger Games'' is the first book in the series and was released on September 14, 2008.

''The Hunger Games'' follows 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her younger sister [[Primrose Everdeen]]. Also selected from District 12 is [[Peeta Mellark]]. They are mentored by their district's only living victor, [[Haymitch Abernathy]], who won 24 years earlier and has since led a solitary life of [[alcoholism]].

Peeta confesses his longtime secret love for Katniss in a televised interview prior to the Games. This revelation stuns Katniss, who harbors feelings for [[Gale Hawthorne]], her friend and hunting partner. Haymitch advises her to feign feelings for Peeta in order to gain wealthy sponsors who can provide crucial supplies to the "[[star-crossed lovers]]" during the Games.

In the arena, Katniss allies with [[Rue (The Hunger Games)|Rue]], a young tribute from District 11 who reminds Katniss of her kid sister. When Rue is killed, Katniss places flowers around her body as an act of defiance toward the Capitol. Then the remaining tributes are alerted to a rule change that allows tributes from the same district to win as a team. Katniss finds a seriously wounded Peeta and nurses him back to health. When all of the other tributes are dead, the rule change is abruptly revoked. With neither willing to kill the other, Katniss comes up with a solution: a double suicide by eating poisonous berries. This forces the authorities to concede just in time to save their lives. During and after the Games, Katniss develops genuine feelings for Peeta and struggles to reconcile them with what she feels for Gale.

Haymitch warns her that the danger is far from over. The authorities are furious at being made fools of, and the only way to try to allay their anger is to pretend that her actions were because of her love for Peeta. On the journey home, Peeta is dismayed to learn of the deception.

===''Catching Fire ''===
{{Main|Catching Fire}}
''Catching Fire'' is the second installment in the series, released on September 1, 2009.

In ''Catching Fire'', which begins six months after the conclusion of ''The Hunger Games'', Katniss learns that her defiance in the previous novel has started a chain reaction that has inspired rebellion in the districts. President Snow threatens to harm Katniss' family and friends if she does not help to defuse the unrest in the districts and marry Peeta. Meanwhile, Peeta has become aware of Katniss' disingenuous love for him, but he has also been informed of Snow's threats, so he promises to help keep up the act to spare the citizens of District 12. Katniss and Peeta tour the districts as victors and plan a public wedding. While they follow Snow's orders and keep up the ruse, Katniss inadvertently fuels the rebellion, and the [[Mockingjays|mockingjay]] pin she wears becomes its symbol. District by district, the citizens of Panem begin to stage uprisings against the Capitol. Snow announces a special 75th edition of the Hunger Games—known as the [[Quarter Quell]]—in which Katniss and Peeta are forced to compete with other past victors, effectively canceling the wedding. At Haymitch's urging, the pair teams up with several other tributes, and manages to destroy the arena and escape the Games. Katniss is rescued by the rebel forces from District 13, and Gale informs her that the Capitol has destroyed District 12, and captured both Peeta and their District 7 ally, [[Johanna Mason]]. Katniss ultimately learns—to her surprise—that she had inadvertently been an integral part of the rebellion all along; her rescue had been jointly planned by Haymitch, [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch Heavensbee]], and [[Finnick Odair]], among others. After some hesitation Katniss joins the rebels.

===''Mockingjay''===
{{Main|Mockingjay}}
''Mockingjay'', the third and final book in ''The Hunger Games'' series, was released on August 24, 2010.

Most of the districts have rebelled against the Capitol, led by District 13 and its President [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Alma Coin|Alma Coin]]. The Capitol lied about the district being destroyed in the Dark Days. After a [[Mexican standoff]] with the Capitol, the District 13 residents took to living underground and rebuilding their strength. The District 12 survivors find shelter with them. Katniss, after seeing first-hand the destruction wrought on her district, agrees to become the "Mockingjay", the symbol of the rebellion. She sets conditions, however. Peeta, Johanna Mason, [[Annie Cresta]], and [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Enobaria|Enobaria]], fellow Games victors captured by the Capitol, are to be granted immunity. Katniss also demands the privilege of killing Snow, but Coin only agrees to flip for the honor.

For her sake, a rescue mission is mounted that succeeds in rescuing Peeta, Johanna and Annie. However, Peeta has been [[Mind control|brainwashed]] to kill Katniss, and he tries to choke her to death upon their reunion. He undergoes experimental treatment to try to cure him.

After she recovers, Katniss and a team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta, Finnick, a [[Film crew|camera crew]], and various other soldiers, are assigned to film propaganda in relatively quiet combat zones. Katniss, however, decides to go to the Capitol to kill Snow, pretending that Coin gave her that mission. Most of the squad are killed along the way, including recently married Finnick. As Katniss approaches Snow's mansion, she sees a group of Capitol children surrounding it as [[human shield]]s. Suddenly a hovercraft drops silver parachutes on the children, who reach for them, hoping they bear food. Some of the parachutes explode, creating carnage. The advancing rebels send in [[medic]]s, including Prim. Then the rest of the parachutes blow up, killing Prim, just as she spots her sister.

Later, Katniss, also injured, awakens from a [[coma]] to learn that the rebels have won, and Snow is awaiting execution at her hands. When she meets Snow by chance, he claims that it was Coin who secretly ordered the bombings in order to strip away the support of his remaining followers. Coin then asks the surviving victors to vote on a final Hunger Games, involving the children of high-ranking Capitol officials (including Snow's granddaughter). Katniss and Haymitch cast the deciding votes in favor of the scheme. However, at what is supposed to be Snow's execution, Katniss instead kills Coin with her bow. Snow laughs, then dies.

Katniss is tried, but the jury believes she was mentally unfit, and she is sent home to District 12. Both Katniss' mother and Gale take jobs in other districts. Peeta regains his sanity. Katniss settles down with him, and after many years of persuasion by him, she finally agrees to have children. They have a girl and then a boy.

The series received criticism regarding its [[reality TV]] "death game" theme being derivative of works such as ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Long Walk]]'',&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; and ''[[Series 7: The Contenders]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Hehir, Andrew|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/what_came_before_the_hunger_games/|title=What came before 'The Hunger Games'|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=March 13, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was also criticized for the romantic plotline: Rollie Welch of Ohio's ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' criticized the characters' lack of resolute behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rollie|last=Welch|url=http://www.cleveland.com/bookreviews/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/125213948127050.xml&amp;coll=2|title='Catching Fire' brings back Suzanne Collins's kindhearted killer|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=September 6, 2009|location=[[Brooklyn, Ohio]]|accessdate=November 26, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68rJLJZUd?url=http://www.cleveland.com/bookreviews/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment-1%2F125213948127050.xml|archivedate=July 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jennifer Reese of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that there was little distinction between Peeta and Gale and the series lacked the "erotic energy" seen in the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Reese|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20300507,00.html|title=Catching Fire review|work = Entertainment Weekly |date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.C. Maçek III of ''[[PopMatters]]'' stated "While [[The Hunger Games (film series)|the film saga]] does capture the [[action (fiction)|action]] of ''The Hunger Games'', the novels are most assuredly the heart of the story. They are nothing less than 'The Writer’s Cut' of the films themselves."&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/the-hunger-games-the-writers-cut-really-is-better/|title='The Hunger Games': The Writer’s Cut Really Is Better|date=20 June 2016|first=J.C.|last=Maçek III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last book, ''Mockingjay'', was criticized by Dan Shade of ''[[SF Site]]'', who felt that Katniss is a weaker character than her comrades and less resolute in her journey to the Capitol, and that with respect to her vendetta against President Snow, her actions in the finale are inconsistent with her established character.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, Dan (2010).

Originally a proposed remake of ''The Mummy'' would have been directed by horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]]. Barker’s vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.&lt;ref name=Slotek&gt;{{cite news | last = Slotek | first = Jim | title = Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| publisher = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = May 2, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cinescape&gt;The Mummy That Wasn't", Cinescape (May 3, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism",&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;Hobson, Louis B (May 1, 1999). "Universal rolls out new, improved Mummy", Calgary Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".&lt;ref name=Slotek/&gt;

In 1999, [[Stephen Sommers]] wrote and directed a remake of ''The Mummy'', loosely based on the original film of 1932.  This film switches genres from the emphasis on horror to adventure, concentrating more on action sequences, special effects, comedy, and a higher element of Egyptian lore. The film became a box office success spawning two sequels, several video games, a [[The Scorpion King|spin-off series]], and an animated television series. The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third one received mostly negative reviews.

[[File:Mummy the Ride.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to ''[[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Hollywood|Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride]]'' at Universal Studios Hollywood.]]

Two video game adaptations of ''The Mummy'' (1999) were developed by [[Rebellion Developments]] and published by [[Konami]] in 2000: an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/014/014640.html|title=The Mummy (PSX)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[Game Boy Color]] [[puzzle game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/action/mummy/index.html|title=The Mummy (GBC)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dreamcast]] version was announced but later cancelled in the late 2000. ''The Mummy Returns'' released in late 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and developed by [[Blitz Games]], the [[Game Boy Color]] version was developed by GameBrains, both versions were published by [[Universal Interactive]]. ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (video game)|The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' was released in 2008, developed by [[Eurocom]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[Wii]], the [[Nintendo DS]] released was developed by [[Artificial Mind and Movement|A2M]], all versions were published by [[Sierra Entertainment]]. In March 2012, a massive multiplayer online game known as ''The Mummy Online'' was released.

In May 2001, [[Chaos! Comics]] released the first of a three-issue series inspired by the film, titled ''The Mummy: Valley of the Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/CoverTitle_List.aspx?id=c8d5397b-9fe6-4997-9966-9d903720bdcc|title=The Mummy Valley of the Gods (Issue List)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was supposed to take place between the first film and ''The Mummy Returns''. Rick and Evelyn are on their honeymoon in Egypt and end up embarking on yet another adventure where they must unravel the mysteries of the Orb of Destiny and discover the location of the Valley of the Gods hidden beneath the sands. However, the second and third issues were never published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=c842164c-db3d-4971-9e13-3bda3d8e555a|title=The Mummy Valley of the Gods (Issue #2)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was most likely due to Chaos later filing bankruptcy in 2002 and selling the rights to all their titles at that time.
Years later in 2008, another Mummy comic series was released by [[IDW Publishing]], spanning four issues. This series was titled ''The Mummy: The Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax''. Unlike the preceding comic series, all of the planned issues were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/CoverTitle_List.aspx?id=b72be0fe-3d59-4755-8aae-5922674ad4d8|title=The Mummy: the Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax (Issue List)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 until 2003, an animated series simply titled ''[[The Mummy (TV series)|The Mummy]]'' was made by [[Universal Animation Studios]] where it was based on the Stephen Sommers series of films. The series was later renamed in the second season as ''The Mummy: Secrets of the Medjai''.

The film also inspired a [[roller coaster]] ride named ''[[Revenge of the Mummy|Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride]]'' in [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios Theme Parks]], [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Florida|Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/attr_rotm.html|title=Universal Studios Hollywood - Revenge of the Mummy - the Ride|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018222516/http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/attr_rotm.html|archivedate=2008-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rides can also be found in [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Hollywood|Hollywood]] and [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Singapore|Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalorlando.com/usf_attr_mummy.html|title=Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride at Universal Orlando Resort|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Themed Entertainment Association''' (TEA) is an international non-profit association that represents creators, developers, designers and producers of [[theming|themed entertainment]].  Its mission, as stated in its bylaws, is to facilitate dialogue and communication among its members, to stimulate knowledge and professional growth, and to expand the size, diversity and awareness of the themed [[Show business|entertainment industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeit.com/bylaws.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207011132/http://www.themeit.com/bylaws.pdf|title=Themed Entertainment Association Bylaws|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association|archivedate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year since 2007, the TEA has hosted SATE (Story + Architecture + Technology = Experience), a lecture-based industry conference.&lt;ref name="SATE"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/Events-Education/SATE/ TEA SATE conference &amp; SATE Academy Days].

{{Anchor|Founding}}

==Founding==
The TEA was founded in 1991 by Monty Lunde, a former special effects designer for Disney who had gone on to start the special effects company Technifex with his business partner Rock Hall. Lunde was finding it difficult to negotiate contracts with large corporations and wanted to organize small businesses in the industry to share best practices, establish common contracts, and facilitate better dialogue with customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blooloop.com/features/technifex-monty-lunde-tea/ TEA and Fantasy: Technifex President and CEO Monty Lunde]. Blooloop. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thea Awards==
The TEA annually presents Thea Awards to projects that exemplify the highest standards of excellence and achievement, including individuals, parks, attractions, exhibits, and experiences in the themed entertainment industry. The Thea Awards began in 1994 with a single honoree: [[Harrison Price|Harrison “Buzz” Price]], the first recipient of the TEA Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livedesignonline.com/business-people-news/thea-confidential Thea Confidential]. Live Design. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; That award is now called the Buzz Price Thea Award for a Lifetime of Outstanding Achievements in his honor.&lt;ref name="About Thea"&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/Thea-Awards/About-thea/ About the Thea Awards]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second recipient was [[Marty Sklar]] in 1995.

In 1996, the Awards for Outstanding Achievement (AOA) were introduced, and ten were distributed. In the years since, additional special categories of AOA have been created, ensuring a multi-award event.&lt;ref name="About Thea" /&gt; Anyone can nominate a project, but judging is conducted by a committee that includes all past lifetime achievement honorees, one board liaison, and nine members-at-large appointed to three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teaconnect.org/Thea-Awards/Thea-Committee/ Thea Committee]. Themed Entertainment Association. Retrieved 2018-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Award recipients are announced in November and formally presented the following spring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30198">The '''United States Telephone Herald Company''', founded in 1909, was the parent corporation for a number of associated "[[telephone newspaper]]" companies, located throughout the United States, that were organized to provide news and entertainment over telephone lines to subscribing homes and businesses. This was the most ambitious attempt made to develop a distributed audio service prior to the rise of radio broadcasting in the early 1920s.

At least a dozen associate companies were chartered, but despite initial optimism and ambitious goals, only two systems ever went into commercial operation — one based in Newark, New Jersey (New Jersey Telephone Herald, 1911-1912) and the other in Portland, Oregon (Oregon Telephone Herald, 1912-1913). Moreover, both of these systems were shut down after operating for only a short time, due to economic and technical issues.

Corporation activity peaked in 1913, but the lack of success caused the company to suspend operations, and the corporation charter for the United States Telephone Herald Company was repealed in early 1918.

==Company history==

[[File:1910 U.S. Telephone Herald stock certificate.JPEG|300px|thumb|right|United States Telephone Herald Company stock certificate (1910).&lt;ref&gt;Twenty-five $10 shares, issued on November 30, 1910 to John J. Griffin. Signed by James Gillies (treasurer) and Manley M. Gillam (president).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The United States Telephone Herald Company was an authorized offshoot of the [[Telefon Hírmondó]] audio service of Budapest, Hungary. The Telefon Hírmondó programming, transmitted to subscribers over telephone wires, consisted of an extensive selection of news during the day, followed by instruction and entertainment during the evening. This "news-teller" service began operation in February 1893, shortly before the death of its inventor, [[Tivadar Puskás]].

Following a visit to Hungary, Cornelius Balassa procured the U.S. patent rights to the Telefon Hírmondó technology. (Later reports state that the company also held the rights for Canada and Great Britain. Another group obtained the rights for Italy, where in 1910 they established the service under the name [[Araldo Telefonico]]). The formation of a parent U.S. company, initially operating under a New York state charter as the "Telephone Newspaper Company of America", was announced in October 1909, with organizing directors Manley M. Gillam (president), William H. Alexander (secretary and treasurer), and Cornelius Balassa, all of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909%20-%209549.pdf" Hark! Telephone Will Tell it All"], ''New York Herald,'' October 7, 1909, page 9 (fultonhistory.com)&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1910, the parent company was reorganized as the "United States Telephone Herald Company", now operating as a Delaware-chartered corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizapedia.com/us/UNITED-STATES-TELEPHONE-HERALD-COMPANY.html United States Telephone Herald Company] entry. (bizapedia.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial demonstration transmission was given at the company headquarters, located at 110 West Thirty-fourth Street in New York City, in early September 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"News Bulletins by 'Phone", ''New York Times'', September 9, 1910, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment used was similar to that which was employed in Budapest. As in Hungary, announcers were called "[[stentor]]s", and because [[vacuum tube]] technology had not been developed yet, there were limited methods for amplification, so to compensate the stentors had to speak as loudly as possible into oversized dual-microphones. The lack of amplification also meant that subscribers needed to listen through headphones instead of loudspeakers. On February 14, 1911 {{US patent|src=uspto|984235}}, describing "a telephone system... adapted for supplying innumerable subscribers... general news, musical compositions, and operas, sermons, correct or standard time and other happenings at stated intervals of day and night" was granted to Árpád Németh, and assigned to the company.

Regionally-based Telephone Herald affiliates were authorized for the purpose of creating local "telephone newspaper" systems, with "the parent company to receive a royalty on every instrument installed".&lt;ref name="short"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w;view=1up;seq=200" 'Phone Herald's Short Life"], ''The Fourth Estate'', March 2, 1912, pages 10, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; But ultimately the parent company and its affiliates proved financially unsuccessful, and the United States Telephone Herald Company began winding down operations. Its Delaware business charter was repealed on January 28, 1918, for failure to pay state corporate taxes for two years.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 1263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone Herald associate companies===

At least twelve Telephone Herald associate companies were formed, although in only two cases was a telephone newspaper service successfully launched: the New Jersey Telephone Herald (1911-1912) and the Oregon Telephone Herald (1912-1913). (In some cases the service was also referred to as the "telectrophone".)

Each associate company was established by local owners operating under a state-granted business charter. Publicity for these services commonly stated that the telephone newspaper subscriptions would cost 5 cents a day. (For comparison, at this time a copy of the daily ''Oregonian'' newspaper in Portland also cost 5 cents.) However, a majority of the associate companies got no further than the promotion or demonstration stages.

In addition to twelve known associate companies, early company publicity stated that installations would also be set up in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;"Newspaper By Phone for Chicago", ''Meriden (Connecticut) Morning Record'', June 15, 1910, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Scranton, Pennsylvania &lt;ref&gt;"No Private Wires on News Telephone", ''Scranton (Pennsylvania) Republican'', September 29, 1910, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and Montreal, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;"News and Opera Over Telephone", ''Montreal Gazette'', January 12, 1911, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but systems do not appear to have been established at any of these locations. Also, a December 14, 1912 advertisement for the Central California Telephone Herald listed associate Telephone Herald companies with company names starting with New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Seattle-Tacoma, Columbia (British Columbia and Alberta, Canada), Los Angeles and Oakland,&lt;ref name=missing&gt;"Central California Telephone Herald" (advertisement), ''Sacramento Bee'', December 14, 1912, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no information for these either.

==Associate companies that launched telephone newspapers==

===New Jersey Telephone Herald Co. (Newark)===

[[File:1912 NJ Telephone Herald daily schedule.GIF|thumb|right|300px|New Jersey Telephone Herald's daily schedule (1912)&lt;ref name="njth"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044048678270;view=1up;seq=712 "Telephone Newspaper—A New Marvel"] by Arthur F. Colton, ''Technical World'', February 1912, pages 666-669. Pictured stentor appears to be Richard D. Arons.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Of the two Telephone Herald affiliates which launched commercial services, the '''New Jersey Telephone Herald''' was both the first and most publicized. The company had been incorporated in October 1910 in the state of New Jersey by Eugene Gorenflo, Duncan McIsaac and Nicholas J. Surgess.

The original plan was to begin operations in March 1911, however, the New York Telephone Company, which operated the Newark telephone system franchise, initially refused to lease telephone lines to the Telephone Herald, on the grounds that their charter did not permit it. It required a ruling by the Public Utility Commission to compel the telephone company to provide the needed wires.&lt;ref name="short" /&gt; The hiring process for the stentors, who worked as the news readers, was competitive and rigorous. According to one of the original stentors, the position was restricted to "college men" with strong voices and extensive vocabularies. Throughout the day four stentors announced during rotating shifts of 15 minutes each, and did staff work when they were not announcing.&lt;ref&gt;"America's First Announcer Hailed From Springfield" by Richard D. Arons, ''Springfield (Massachusetts) Sunday Union and Republican'', February 12, 1928, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 1911, an ambitious daily service, closely patterned after the Telefon Hírmondó's, was launched to a reported fifty receivers located in a department store waiting room, plus five hundred Newark homes. The company's central offices, studio, and switch rooms were located in the Essex Building on Clinton Street in Newark. Condit S. Atkinson, who had extensive newspaper experience, headed the service's news department.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor Atkinson Gets Out First Issue of News by Wire", ''New Brunswick (New Jersey) Times'', October 25, 1911, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company reported that there were many persons eager to sign up with the innovative service, and it soon had more potential subscribers than could be supported. One young listener later remembered that "it was a great thrill to pick up the small receiver and hear a voice telling about world events", moreover, "It was such a novelty that I could scarcely wait to get home from school and listen to it. It fascinated me. I would listen as long as it was operative, or until I was called to do my homework."&lt;ref&gt;''My Father Was Uncle Wiggily'' by Roger Garis, 1966, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the program features was a series of original "Trippertrot" stories, written by local children's author [[Howard R. Garis]], which were later assembled into two book collections: ''Three Little Trippertrots'' and ''Three Little Trippertrots on Their Travels'', published in 1912.
 	
Despite the enthusiastic response, the company soon ran into serious technical and financial difficulties. Due to a revenue crisis, which resulted in employees walking off the job due to missed paychecks, the service was suspended in late February 1912.&lt;ref name="short" /&gt; A replenishment of funding resulted in a temporary revival in late May, with the primary company officials now consisting of Percy Pyne (president), William E. Gunn (vice-president and general manager), and C. E. Danforth (secretary-treasurer), with C. S. Atkinson renewing his editor functions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w;view=1up;seq=527 "The Newark Telephone Herald Resumes"], ''The Fourth Estate'', June 1, 1912, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this would only be a temporary respite, and the telephone newspaper transmissions shut down for good in December 1912.

A later review suggested that the primary issue was technical, as the twisted pair phone lines used for the Newark operation had different electrical characteristics than the wiring used by the original Telefon Hírmondó plant.&lt;ref&gt;"Broadcasting in 1912" by G. C. B. Rowe, ''Radio News'', June, 1925, pages 2219, 2309, 2311.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the permanent suspension of services, the New Jersey Telephone Herald's business charter was declared null and void on January 18, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 853.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon Telephone Herald Co. (Portland)===

Although less well known than the New Jersey affiliate, the second Telephone Herald company to implement an ongoing telephone newspaper service was the '''Oregon Telephone Herald Company'''. But like its predecessor, it also soon faced financial difficulties and was short-lived. The company was incorporated in Oregon, and headquartered at 506 Royal Building (Seventh and Morrison) in Portland. Extensive demonstrations were begun in May 1912, and advertisements the next month said commercial service would start "around October 1st".&lt;ref name="demos"&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1912-06-30/ed-1/seq-5/ "Oregon Telephone Herald" (advertisement)], ''The Sunday Oregonian'', June 30, 1912, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 1913 solicitation for home subscribers for "The Talking Newspaper and Amusement Purveyor" listed the hours of operation as 8:00 AM to midnight.&lt;ref name="orpheum"&gt;[https://gallery.multcolib.org/document/lambardi-grand-opera-company-heilig-theatre-november-18-1912 Theater program], Lambardi Grand Opera Company, Heilig Theatre, Portland, Oregon, November 18, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Later advertisements referred to the service as the "Te-Lec-Tro-Phone", and in April saw the introduction of the reporting of local [[Portland Beavers]] baseball games.&lt;ref name="play"&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-04-14/ed-1/seq-12/ "Everybody-Play Ball" (advertisement)], ''Morning Oregonian'', April 14, 1912, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; (In December, a Northwestern League representative complained that the service had hurt attendance, and supported "the ousting of the various telephone herald and signalling systems from the ball parks"). A promotion the following month offered the chance to hear election results for free at twenty-five business sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-05-03/ed-1/seq-8/ "Te-lec-tro-phone Election Returns" (advertisement)], ''Portland Oregonian'', May 3, 1913, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the Portland Hotel advertised that diners could listen to "the latest baseball, business and other news by Telephone-Herald" with their meals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-05-07/ed-1/seq-5/ "The Portland Hotel" (advertisement)], ''Morning Oregonian'', May 7, 1913, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There appears to have been a company reorganization in early 1913, and in March two representatives from the parent company, including chief electrical engineer Árpád Németh, were reported in town to give technical advice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1913-03-16/ed-1/seq-4/ "Phone Device Assured"], ''Morning Oregonian'', March 16, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; But as with its New Jersey predecessor, the Portland enterprise was in trouble. During the summer, Oregon Corporation Commissioner R. A. Watson stepped in, and, under provisions of the state's "Blue Sky Law", barred the Oregon Telephone Herald from doing business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83025138/1913-08-29/ed-1/seq-6/ "Blue Sky Law Applied"], ''Morning Oregonian'', August 29, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "There was no question about the honesty of this concern, but the scheme isn't practical, and while it might be popular for a short time it would be a failure in the end; therefore, we refused them a permit to sell stock."&lt;ref&gt;"Malheur County Leads State", ''Malheur (Vale, Oregon) Enterprise'', October 25, 1913, pages 1, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final advertisements for the company appeared in June 1913, and the state corporation charter was terminated on January 16, 1917, for failure to file statements or pay fees for two years.

==Other associate companies ==

None of the other ten Telephone Herald associate companies launched their proposed telephone newspaper systems, although there were widely varying levels of plans  and activities.

===Boston Telephone Herald Syndicate, Inc.===

Incorporated in Massachusetts on April 23, 1913, by Ladislaus de Doory (president), John M. Grosvenor, Jr. (treasurer), and Jesse W. Morton. De Doory was also a promoter with the parent company. However, the syndicate does not appear to have made any demonstrations or other significant development, and its business charter was dissolved on February 21, 1916.

===California Telephone Herald Co. (San Francisco)===

This was the first of two companies that were headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company received a California business charter in February 1911, issued to G. S. Holbrook, W. A. Whelan, W. B. Heckmann, A. H. Vorrath, R. M. Graham, R. Boreman, William T. Newverth, A. C. Gould and A. Jacoby.

Demonstrations were conducted in September 1911 at 821, 822, 823 Head Building, but no further progress appears to have been made, and the company charter was declared forfeited and repealed for non-payment of taxes in February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central California Telephone Herald Co. (Sacramento)===

Incorporated in California in February, 1912 by C. J. Ward, F. W. Bresse and S. H. Whisner. Demonstrations were begun on April 2, 1912 from 4th Floor of the Elks' Building.&lt;ref&gt;"Central California Telephone Herald" (advertisement), ''Sacramento Bee'', April 2, 1912, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1913, provisions were made to lease a local theater, the Diepenbrock, to serve as a source for programming.&lt;ref&gt;"Big Free Concert to Open Diepenbrock", ''Sacramento Bee'', November 19, 1913, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was an abrupt change of plans, and instead the owners decided to merge their operations with the Pacific Telephone Herald Company.&lt;ref name="merger"&gt;"Items of Local Interest", ''Placerville (California) Mountain Democrat'', December 6, 1913, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone newspaper service never became operational, either before or after the Pacific Telephone Herald merger. The company's charter was declared forfeited and repealed for non-payment of taxes in February 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts Telephone Herald Co.===

This company was chartered in Delaware in August 1912 by R. R. Cooling, C. J. Jacobs and H. W. Davis of Wilmington, Delaware. There is no additional information, other than the fact that its corporation charter was repealed on January 24, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 913.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Telephone Herald Co. (Oakland, California)===

The company was incorporated in California. Demonstrations were made at H. C. Capwell Company's Store beginning in February 1913 which lasted through at least April. The original corporate offices were at 303-304-305 Union Savings Bank Building in Oakland, prior to a relocation to 1741 Franklin Street.

The company's secretary-treasurer, J. B. Whited died in September 1913, and the company president, William Angus, was killed in a mining accident in October 1914. In addition, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company initially refused to lease telephone lines to the company, resulting in a complaint filed before the Railroad Commission of the State of California. This case was dismissed on November 5, 1913 after the two sides reached a settlement.

In November 1913, a major expansion was announced, with the purchase from the parent company of the rights to operate in twenty-one western U.S. states and "the greater part of southwestern Canada",&lt;ref&gt;"Telephone Herald Co. Acquires Facilities", ''Oakland Tribune'', November 18, 1913, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and the next month saw a merger with the Central California Telephone Herald Company of Sacramento.&lt;ref name="merger" /&gt; But despite the ambitious expansion plans, it does not appear that any regular service was ever established, and the state business charter was forfeited on March 4, 1916 for failure to pay the state license tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. II'' (1928), page 1077.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania Telephone Herald Co. (Philadelphia)===

Incorporated in the state of Delaware on December 30, 1911 by Frank Vernon, Ivor B. Blaiberg, and Albert D. Miller. Although there was a limited amount of corporate activity reported in 1912-1913,&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuo.ark:/13960/t3jx22z8w;view=1up;seq=509 "Philadelphia to Have a Telephone Herald"], ''The Fourth Estate'', May 25, 1912, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; nothing of significance appears to have resulted. The corporation charter was repealed on January 25, 1917 for two years taxes unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 955.&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Diego Telephone Herald Co.===

Incorporated in California in August 1911 by H. A. Schmidt (president), M. N. Schmidt and G. Stephens. The principals were inspired by the reported success of the concept in San Francisco, and promotional advertisements were run in the fall of 1911,&lt;ref&gt;"One Who Knows the Telephone Herald" (advertisement), ''San Diego Union'', October 29, 1911, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; but the enterprise never began operations.

===San Francisco Telephone Herald Co.===

This was second San Francisco-based Telephone Herald company, following the earlier California Telephone Herald Company. It was incorporated in the state of California on October 29, 1912, with founding the directors of W. H. Dohrmann, J. F. Dohrmann, A. J. Beecher, F. W. Beecher, Thomas R. White, C. E. Youngblood, Rudolph Schlueten, Clarence Eppstein and E. L. Manner.

Demonstrations were given at 687 Market Street in early January 1913, but no further progress appears to have been made. The corporation charter was forfeited November 30, 1913, for failure to pay the state license tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. II'' (1928), page 1226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern California Telephone Herald Co. (Los Angeles)===

One of the first associate companies to be formed, this was also, due to fraud, one of the first to fail. It was chartered in California in May 1911, led by Peter Archbold Gordon Grimes, who turned out to be a con man. Grimes soon ran off with company funds, and was next seen impersonating an aviator in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1912-07-26/ed-1/seq-6/" 'Kenneth Gordon, Aviator' Turns Out to Be Plain Peter Grimes",] ''The Hawaiian Gazette'', July 26, 1912, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation charter was forfeited on November 30, 1911 for failure to pay its state license tax.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. I'' (1926), page 1140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Telephone Herald Co. (Seattle)===

This affiliate, capitalized with $500,000 of common stock, was chartered in the state of Washington in June, 1911. The officers were Sherwood Gillespy, president; B. J. Klarman, vice president; and N. R. Solner, secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;"Tube in Wall to Tell All News", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', June 7, 1911, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that demonstrations were being conducted at the company headquarters at 339-340-341 Henry building.&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Telephone Herald Company" (advertisement) ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', June 11, 1911, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The company soon faced financial difficulties, and in October was forced into receivership due to a salary dispute.&lt;ref&gt;"Receiver for Telephone Herald", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', October 4, 1911, page 5; "Two Receivers are Appointed", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', October 8, 1911, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The company charter was cancelled sometime during the biennial reporting period of October 1, 1912 to September 30, 1914, for failure to pay the annual state license fee.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvyn Scudder Manual of Extinct or Obsolete Companies: Vol. III'' (1930), page 1422.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

There were a few other early attempts to set up telephone-based news and entertainment systems in the United States, including the [[Tellevent]], which conducted demonstrations and experimental work in Michigan from 1906-1908, and the [[Automatic Electric|Automatic Electric Company's]] [[Musolaphone]], which operated a short-lived entertainment system in Chicago in 1913. However, these efforts were no more successful than the Telephone Herald companies.

Both the Hungarian [[Telefon Hírmondó]] and the Italian [[Araldo Telefonico]] survived long enough for their operations to be combined with radio broadcasting in the 1920s. The same did not occur in the United States, and the Telephone Herald companies were the last early effort to offer nationwide audio programming over telephone lines. Although the concept of home audio entertainment was attractive to potential U.S. subscribers, the lack of signal amplification and other technical limitations, such as the need to maintain a telephone line infrastructure, and having to listen over headphones, made the technology unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Uses of the Telephone" by Carolyn Marvin, ''Communication in History'', 1995, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a decade after the failure of the Telephone Herald companies, radio broadcasting was developed, which had the significant advantage that it could dispense with the need to use telephone lines. Moreover, radio programming could be provided free of subscription fees, because selling airtime to advertisers, the financing method most commonly adopted in the United States, provided sufficient revenue for ongoing operations.

'''Voice acting''' is the art of performing [[voice-over]]s or providing voices to represent a character or to provide information to an audience or user. Examples include [[animation|animated]], off-stage, off-screen or non-visible characters in various works, including feature [[film]]s, [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] foreign language films, animated [[short film]]s, [[television program]]s, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[radio drama|radio or audio dramas]], [[Radio comedy|comedy]], [[video game]]s, [[Puppetry|puppet shows]], [[List of amusement rides|amusement ride]]s, [[audiobook]]s and [[Documentary film|documentaries]]. Voice acting is also done for small handheld [[audio game]]s.

Performers are called '''voice actors''' or '''actresses''', '''voice artists''' or '''voice talent'''. Their roles may also involve singing, although a second voice actor is sometimes cast as the character's [[singing]] voice. Voice acting is recognised in Britain as a specialized dramatic profession, chiefly owing to the [[BBC]]'s long tradition of radio drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2RSmkTlT319KR9yd9DmzBb6/acting-for-radio|title=Soundstart - Acting for Radio|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230080050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2RSmkTlT319KR9yd9DmzBb6/acting-for-radio|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement.

==Types==
{{further information|Voice-over|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}

===Character voices===
The voices for animated characters are provided by [[voice actor]]s. For [[live action]] productions, voice acting often involves reading the parts of computer programs, radio dispatchers, or other characters who never actually appear on screen. With a [[radio drama]] or [[Compact Disc]] [[drama]], there is more freedom in voice acting, because there is no need to match a dub to the original actors, or to match an animated character.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Producers and agencies are on the look out for many styles of voices such as booming voices, which maybe perfect for more dramatic productions or cute, young sounding voices that are perfect for trendier markets.

Some just sound like regular, natural, everyday people and all of these voices have their place in the Voiceover world, provided they are used correctly and in the right context.&lt;ref&gt;How to be a voiceover in todays world {{cite web |url=https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/how-to-become-a-voice-artist/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918064951/https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/how-to-become-a-voice-artist/ |archivedate=2017-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narration===
In the context of voice acting, [[narration]] is the use of spoken commentary to convey a [[narrative|story]] to an [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Narration in Poetry and Drama|author-last1=Hühn|author-first1=Peter|author-last2=Sommer|author-first2=Roy|work=The Living Handbook of Narratology|year=2012|publisher=Interdisciplinary Center for Narratology, University of Hamburg|url=http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218060329/http://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narration-poetry-and-drama|archivedate=2015-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A narrator is a personal character or a non-personal voice that the creator of the story develops to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. The voice actor who plays the narrator is responsible for performing the scripted lines assigned to the narrator.

In traditional literary narratives (such as [[novels]], [[short stories]], and [[memoir]]s), narration is a required [[literary element|story element]]; in other types of (chiefly non-literary) narratives, such as plays, television shows, video games, and films, narration is merely optional.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Commercial ===
One of the most common uses for voice acting is within commercial advertising. The voice actor is hired to voice a message associated with the advertisement. This has different subgenres; television, radio, cinema, and web-advertising. The subgenres are all different styles in their own right. For example, television commercials tend to be voiced with a narrow, flat inflection pattern (or [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] pattern), whereas radio (especially local radio) commercials tend to be voiced with a very wide inflection pattern in an almost over-the-top style. 

Markerters and advertisers use voiceover all over their projects, from radio, to TV, to online and more! Total advertising spend in the UK is forecast to be £21.8 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/industry-insight-and-tips/|title=Industry insights – The Voice Finder|author=|date=|website=thevoicefinder.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019224514/https://thevoicefinder.com/todo/industry-insight-and-tips/|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voiceover used in commercial adverts also is the only area of voice acting where de-breathing is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gravyforthebrain.com/gravytimes/commercial-voiceover-when-should-you-debreath/|title=Debreath your Voiceovers the Human Way|date=2016-06-02|website=Gravy Times - Voiceover Blog|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; De-breathing means artificially removing breaths from the recorded voice. This is done to stop the audience being distracted in any way from the commercial message that is being put across.{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

===Translation===
[[Dub localization]] is a type of [[voice-over]].  It is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] altering a [[foreign language]] [[film]], [[art film]] or [[television series]] by voice actors.

[[Voice-over translation]] is an [[audiovisual translation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=USA|first1=Translate|title=Voice-over Translation|url=http://www.usatranslate.com/voice-over-translation-funny-way-of-translation/|website=USATranslate.com|accessdate=31 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231132326/http://www.usatranslate.com/voice-over-translation-funny-way-of-translation/|archivedate=31 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; technique, in which, unlike in Dub localization, actor voices are recorded over the original audio track, which can be heard in the background. This method of translation is most often used in [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[news report]]s to translate words of foreign-language interviewees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Automated dialogue replacement===
{{main article|Dubbing (filmmaking)#ADR/post-sync}}
Automated dialogue replacement (ADR) is the process of re-recording dialogue by the original actor after the filming process to improve audio quality or reflect dialogue changes (also known as "looping" or a "looping session").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADR: Hollywood Dialogue Recording Secrets|url=http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/adr-hollywood-dialogue-recording-secrets|work=Creative COW Magazine|publisher=Creative COW|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Cowdog|year=2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815105431/http://magazine.creativecow.net/article/adr-hollywood-dialogue-recording-secrets|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dark Knight Without Heath Ledger: How will Warner Bros. sell a summer blockbuster marked by tragedy?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/hollywoodland/2008/01/the_dark_knight_without_heath_ledger.html|work=Slate|publisher=The Slate Group, LLC|accessdate=30 July 2012|first=Kim|last=Masters|date=31 January 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620093828/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/hollywoodland/2008/01/the_dark_knight_without_heath_ledger.html|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADR is also used to change original lines recorded on set to clarify context, improve [[diction]] or [[Synchronization|timing]], or to replace an accented vocal performance. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is also called "post-synchronization" or "post-sync".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Automated announcements===
Voice artists are also used to record the individual sample fragments played back by a computer in an automated announcement. At its simplest, each recording consists of a short phrase which is played back when necessary, e.g. the "[[Mind the gap]]" announcement introduced by London Underground in 1969. In a more complicated system, such as a speaking clock, the announcement is re-assembled from fragments such as "minutes past" "eighteen" and "p.m." For example, the word "twelve" can be used for both "Twelve O'Clock" and "Six Twelve."

Automated announcements can also include on-hold messages on phone systems and location-specific announcements in tourist attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.debbiegrattan.com/blog/benefits-of-voice-over-phone-patch/|title=Benefits of Phone Automation &amp; phone patch|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice acting by country==

===Japan===
{{Main article|Voice acting in Japan}}

'''{{nihongo|Seiyū|声優|lead=yes}}''' occupations include performing roles in [[anime]], audio dramas and video games, performing voice-overs for [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of non-Japanese movies, and providing narration to documentaries and similar programs. Because the animation industry in Japan is so prolific, voice actors in Japan are able to have full-time careers as voice-over artists. Japanese voice actors are able to take greater charge of their careers than voice actors in other countries. Japan has approximately 130 voice acting schools and troupes of voice actors, who work for a specific broadcast company or talent agency. They often attract their own appreciators and fans, who watch shows specifically to hear their favorite actor or actress.

Many Japanese voice actors frequently branch into music, often singing the opening or closing themes of shows in which their character stars, or become involved in non-animated side projects such as [[audio drama]]s (involving the same characters in new story lines) or [[image song]]s (songs sung in character that are not included in the anime but which further develop the character).

===Brazil===

Although voice acting is criticized heavily in [[Brazil]], most of the films in the theaters are dubbed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and most [[Brazilians]] prefer watching movies in their native language.{{Which|date=March 2017}} Voice acting in Brazil has been highly acclaimed by other countries. Many voice actors are also dubbing directors, people that direct other voice actors, and [[translators]]. To become a voice actor in Brazil, you need to be a professional actor and attend dubbing courses. Celebrities in Brazil have done voice acting, although Brazilians generally do not like when celebrities who are not actors do voice acting.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Colombia===

As Colombian Spanish is considered one of the most clear forms of Spanish {{By whom|date=November 2017}}, a great deal of Spanish language voice acting is in Colombia using local voice talent. Colombia voice over services are one of the most popular followed by synchronization and subtitling, according to Alexander Torrenegra .{{who|date=November 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Voice acting in video games==
{{Too many examples|section|date=March 2017}}
Across many of the main game-manufacturing countries, in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and [[Voice acting in Japan#Video games|Japan]], actors often lend their voices to characters in games and some have made a career of it. Their names have sometimes been linked to a particular character they have voiced.

It involves a series of [[auditions]] in front of a [[Film producer|producer]]/[[Film director|director]].

==Online voice casting==
There has been a shift to online voice over casting in recent years. With many professional voice talent utilizing home studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdrewvo.com/html/home_voiceover_studio.html|title=Home Voiceover Studios-Equipping Yours-Peter Drew Voiceovers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; clients are able to cut out traditional bricks and mortar agents. Websites devoted exclusively to pre-screened professional voice over talent are servicing international clients often faster and cheaper than the traditional casting process of voice talent physically being required to be in a studio.

The '''XFL''' was a professional [[American football]] league that played its only season in 2001. As originally conceived, the XFL was operated as a joint venture between the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now known as WWE) and [[NBC]]. The XFL was conceived as an outdoor football league that would take place during the [[National Football League|NFL]] off-season, and was promoted as having fewer rules and encouraging rougher play than other major leagues. The league had eight teams in two divisions, including major markets and those not directly served by the NFL, such as Birmingham, Las Vegas, Memphis, and Orlando. The XFL operated as a single entity (unlike most other professional sports leagues, which operate under the franchise model), with all teams centrally owned by the league.

Co-owner NBC served as the main broadcaster of XFL games, along with [[UPN]] and [[Paramount Network|TNN]]. The presentation of XFL games featured [[sports entertainment]] elements inspired by [[professional wrestling]], including [[heat (wrestling)|heat]] and [[kayfabe]] (although the games and their outcomes were legitimate), suggestively-dressed [[cheerleader]]s, and occasional usage of WWF personalities (such as [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Jim Ross]], and [[Jerry Lawler]]) as part of on-air commentary crews alongside sportscasters and veteran football players. The telecasts also featured extensive usage of aerial [[skycam]]s and on-player microphones to provide additional perspectives of the games.

The first night of play brought higher television viewership than NBC had projected, but ratings quickly nosedived. The league garnered a negative reputation due to its connections to professional wrestling and the WWF, the overall quality of play, and a presentation that differed starkly from network football telecasts of the era (albeit with technical and on-air innovations that would later become commonplace). [[Lorne Michaels]], executive producer of NBC's long-running ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', was also critical of the XFL when a game going into double overtime caused the show to be delayed until after midnight on the east coast (prompting moves to speed up play, if not pre-empt the conclusion of a game entirely if it did not finish by a specific time, in order to minimize disruptions to ''SNL'').

NBC and the WWF both lost $35 million on their $100 million investment in the league's inaugural season. Although committing to broadcast two seasons, NBC [[cancellation (television)|pulled out of its broadcast contract]] for the XFL after the inaugural season, citing the poor viewership. While WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]] initially stated that the XFL would continue without NBC, and proposed the addition of expansion teams, unfavorable demands of the league by UPN hastened the XFL's demise, and the league ceased operations entirely in May 2001 a month after the championship game. The [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] were the XFL's first and only champions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/why-the-xfl-failed-19101/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105859/http://www.sportinglife360.com/index.php/why-the-xfl-failed-19101/ |date=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/05/11/0511topnews.html |title=Top Of The News: XFL Exterminated |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, LLC|date= |accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon conceded that the league was a "colossal failure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/77582/516-this-day-in-history.html?p=1|title=5/16 This day in history|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=May 16, 2013|publisher=PWInsider|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahon maintained control of the XFL brand after the league ceased operations, and on January 25, 2018, he announced [[XFL (2020)|the return of the XFL]] with a target relaunch date of 2020. The revival will be owned by McMahon's Alpha Entertainment, a company separate from WWE.

==Founding==
Created as a 50–50 joint venture between [[NBC]] and WWF-owned subsidiary WWE Properties International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/otherfb/news/2001/0327/1163009.html |title=DeVito says NBC not necessary for next year |date=March 27, 2001 |newspaper=[[ESPN]]  |publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the company name "XFL, LLC", the XFL was created as a "[[entity|single-entity league]];" instead of the [[sports franchising|franchise model]] used by the NFL and other major leagues, or the hybrid model where investors in the league are given operations over teams (as used in [[Major League Soccer]]), the XFL uniformly owned and operated all of its teams as one corporation, with no individual owners. [[Vince McMahon]]'s original plan was to purchase the [[Canadian Football League]] (after the CFL initially approached him about purchasing the [[Toronto Argonauts]]) and "[[Canadian Football League in the United States|have it migrate south]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania23/2007/03/29/3862428.html |title=Vince McMahon Q&amp;A |first=Tim |last=Baines |publisher=Canoe |agency=''[[Ottawa Sun]]'' |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while NBC, who had lost their long-held broadcast rights to the NFL's [[American Football Conference|American Football Conference (AFC)]] to [[CBS]] in 1998, was moving ahead with [[Time Warner]] to create a football league of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/129418/time-warner-and-nbc-to-form-new-pro-league |title=Time Warner and NBC to Form New Pro League |publisher=SportBusiness |date=September 28, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826132230/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/129418/time-warner-and-nbc-to-form-new-pro-league |archivedate=26 August 2012 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}} (Note: the article, despite the 2001 date, was written in 1998. See also: "[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20352535.html TNT, NBC consider new football league]")&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the league was first announced by league commissioner Tyler Schueck on February 3, 2000. The XFL was originally conceived to build on the success of the NFL and [[professional wrestling]]. It combined the scoring system of the NFL with the [[kayfabe]] and stunts of the [[WWE|WWF]]. As WWF was, at the time, in the midst of its [[Attitude Era]], the XFL's presentation likewise would reflect that approach toward football, with its emphasis on sex and violence. It was hyped as "real" football without penalties for roughness and with fewer rules in general. The games would feature players and coaches with microphones and cameras in the huddle and in the [[locker room]]s. Stadiums featured [[trash-talk]]ing public address announcers and scantily-clad [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]]s who were encouraged to date the players. Instead of a pre-game coin toss, XFL officials put the ball on the ground and let a player from each team scramble for it to determine who received the kickoff option. The practice was dubbed "The Human Coin Toss" by commentators, and one player famously separated his shoulder on the first scramble, missing the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/this-is-the-xfl-again-controversial-football-league-set-to-return-in-2020/|title=This is the XFL, again: Controversial football league set to return in 2020|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The XFL featured extensive television coverage, with three games televised each week on [[NBC]], [[UPN]], and [[Spike (TV channel)#The National Network and The New TNN (2000–2003)|TNN]]. To accommodate this, it placed four of its teams in the four largest U.S. media markets: [[New York metropolitan area|New York City/North Jersey]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Greater Los Angeles]] (this was during the [[History of the National Football League in Los Angeles|NFL's 21-year absence from the Los Angeles metro area]]). The remaining four teams were placed in markets that had previously hosted teams in second-tier and/or rival major leagues: Birmingham, Memphis, Las Vegas, and Orlando. All of the XFL's markets except Las Vegas had hosted teams in the [[United States Football League]] in the 1980s; Las Vegas, along with Birmingham and Memphis, had hosted short-lived CFL teams in the 1990s.

The XFL chose unusual names for its teams, most of which either referenced images of uncontrolled insanity ([[Memphis Maniax|Maniax]], [[Orlando Rage|Rage]], [[Los Angeles Xtreme|Xtreme]], [[San Francisco Demons|Demons]]) or criminal activity ([[Chicago Enforcers|Enforcers]], [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen|Hitmen]], [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Outlaws]], and the [[Birmingham Thunderbolts|Birmingham Blast]]). After outrage from Birmingham residents who noted that Birmingham had a history of notorious "blasts", including the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in 1963 and [[Eric Rudolph]]'s 1998 bombing of a local abortion clinic, the XFL changed the name of the Birmingham team to the more benign "Birmingham Thunderbolts" (later shortened to "Bolts").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bolts for short |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2000/08/24/xfl_birmingham_ap/ |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 25, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010185318/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2000/08/24/xfl_birmingham_ap/ |archivedate=October 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, the "X" in XFL did not stand for "extreme", as in "eXtreme Football League".{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=9}} When the league was first organized in 1999, it was originally supposed to stand for "Xtreme Football League"; however, there was already a league in formation at the same time with that name, and so promoters wanted to make sure that everyone knew that the "X" did not actually stand for anything (though McMahon would comment that "if the NFL stood for the 'No Fun League', the XFL will stand for the 'e'''x'''tra '''f'''un '''l'''eague'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/sports/sports-business-wwf-alters-script-and-looks-to-football.html |work=[[The New York Times]]  |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|title=SPORTS BUSINESS; W.W.E. Alters Script and Looks to Football |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |date=4 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The other Xtreme Football League, which was also organized in 1999, merged with the [[Arena Football League]]'s minor league [[AF2]] before ever playing a single game.

==Draft==

The only main draft for the league took place over a three-day period from October 28, 2000 to October 30, 2000. A total of 475 players were selected initially, with 65 additional players then selected in a supplemental draft on December 29, 2000.

==2001 season==
[[File:XflNight.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[Chicago Enforcers]] XFL game at [[Soldier Field]]]]

===On the field===
The XFL's opening game took place on February 3, 2001, one year after the league was announced, less than one week following the NFL's [[Super Bowl]]. The first game was between the [[New York/New Jersey Hitmen]] and the [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Las Vegas Outlaws]] at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

The league's regular season structure was set up so that each team played teams in its own division twice in the season, home and away (the same as the [[National Football League]]) and played against teams in the other division once. The season ran ten weeks, with no [[bye (sports)|bye weeks]].

The league's western division was far more competitive than the east, with the four teams' records ranging from 7–3 (for eventual champion Los Angeles) to 4–6 (Las Vegas, who finished last after losing its last three games to end up one game out of a playoff spot). In the East, New York and Chicago both were hampered by slow starts and ineffective starters before making personnel changes that improved their play, while Orlando, under quarterback [[Jeff Brohm]], who owned the league's highest QB rating at 99.9 during the 2001 XFL season, soared to first place, winning its first six games before Brohm suffered a career-ending injury and the team regressed (the team went 2–2 in his absence). Birmingham started the season 2–1 before a rash of injuries (and tougher competition, as its two wins were against New York and Chicago) led to the team losing the last seven games. Injuries were a major problem across the league: only three of the league's eight Opening Day starting quarterbacks&amp;nbsp;—Los Angeles's [[Tommy Maddox]], San Francisco's [[Mike Pawlawski]] and Memphis's [[Jim Druckenmiller]]—were still starters by the end of the season. Birmingham and Las Vegas were both on their third-string quarterbacks by the end of the ten-week season.

The top two teams in each division qualified for the playoffs. To avoid teams having to play each other three times in a season, the league set up the semifinal round of the playoffs so that the games would feature teams from opposite divisions: the east division champion (Orlando) hosted the west division runner-up (San Francisco), and likewise for the west champion and east runner-up (Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively). Los Angeles and San Francisco each won their playoff games to advance to the [[Million Dollar Game|XFL championship]].

===Off the field===
The opening game ended with a 19–0 victory for the Outlaws, and was watched on NBC by an estimated 14 million viewers. During the telecast, [[NBC]] switched over to the game between the [[Orlando Rage]] and the [[Chicago Enforcers]], which was a closer contest than the blowout taking place in Las Vegas. The opening night drew a 9.5 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]].{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=171}}

Although the opening-week games actually delivered ratings double those of what NBC had promised advertisers (and more viewers than the [[2001 Pro Bowl]]), the audience declined sharply to a 4.6 in just one week,{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} and eventually dropped to minuscule levels.

A further problem was that the XFL itself was the brainchild of Vince McMahon, a man who was ridiculed by mainstream sports journalists due to the stigma attached to [[professional wrestling]] as being "[[Work (professional wrestling)|fake]]"; many journalists even jokingly speculated whether any of the league's games were [[Match fixing|rigged]], although nothing of this sort was ever seriously investigated.

Even longtime NBC sportscaster [[Bob Costas]] joined in the mocking of the league. Dick Ebersol purposely allowed Costas and other NBC Sports veterans to opt out of the network's coverage of the league (hence with the exception of long-departed ''[[NFL on NBC]]'' analyst [[Mike Adamle]], its coverage was helmed mostly by younger unknowns and professional wrestling figures), and Costas in particular did not like McMahon's approach to the sport. In an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in February 2001, after the league's second week of play, Costas joked: "It has to be at least a decade since I first mused out loud, 'Why doesn't somebody combine mediocre [[high school football]] with a tawdry [[strip club]]?' Finally, somebody takes my idea and runs with it."&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, Tom, [http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/TOP-OF-THE-SIXTH-2952184.php Top of the Sixth], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' online edition (SFGate.com), February 15, 2001.  Retrieved May 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Costas interviewed McMahon for an episode of his [[HBO]] show ''[[On the Record with Bob Costas|On the Record]]'' as the league was in decline; McMahon's defiant attitude toward Costas was later cited as hastening the league's demise.

==XFL rule changes==
Despite boasts of a "rules-light" game and universally negative reviews from the mainstream sports media early on, the XFL played a brand of 11-man outdoor football that was recognizable,&lt;!-- Good writing, well done! --&gt; aside from the opening game sprint to determine possession and some other changes, some modified during the season as it progressed. The league's coaches vetoed a proposal to eliminate ineligible receivers (allowing any player to receive a forward pass) midway through the season, on account that the change would be too radical.

===Grass stadiums===
The league deliberately avoided placing teams in stadiums with [[artificial turf]], which at the time had a bad reputation both for being unsightly as well as being more hazardous to play on compared to natural turf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xflboard.com/stadiums/index.htm List of stadiums] courtesy of xflboard.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The league's requirement for [[grass]] fields automatically ruled out the use of [[dome]]d stadiums since no such stadium capable of accommodating a grass football field existed in the U.S. in 2001 (the only [[retractable roof]] stadiums complete at the time were used exclusively for [[Major League Baseball]]; the first retractable roof stadium for NFL use was not completed until [[NRG Stadium|Reliant Stadium]] opened for the expansion [[Houston Texans]] in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]). Furthermore, every XFL field was designed identically, with no individual team branding on the field. Each [[end zone]] and 50-yard line was decorated with the XFL logo, with the endzones also being painted black.

Most of the league's stadiums were football-specific facilities, the only exception being San Francisco's [[Pacific Bell Park]] (home of the [[San Francisco Giants]]) which was built primarily for [[baseball]], but (unlike many newer baseball-specific stadiums) can accommodate football. Two XFL stadiums ([[Giants Stadium]] and [[Soldier Field]]) were also then-current NFL stadiums, while two others ([[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] and the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]]) had previously hosted NFL games; the NFL would return to the Coliseum when [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] returned to Los Angeles in 2016. The remaining fields were in regular use as [[college football]] venues at the time.

The home team in every stadium was required to occupy the sideline opposite the press box in order to be visible to the television cameras. Due to the odd field dimensions in San Francisco, teams playing there were permitted to occupy the same sideline (a similar arrangement existed in the NFL when the [[Green Bay Packers]] played at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]).

The all-grass field stipulation caused the league to skip over several of the country's largest markets, including [[Houston]] and [[Philadelphia]], since they lacked a large grass stadium in 2001.&lt;!--Dallas had the Cotton Bowl and Detroit had Tiger Stadium--&gt; In the league's two northernmost markets, Chicago and New York/New Jersey (the latter of which played in [[Giants Stadium]] during a brief window in which the stadium's usual artificial turf had been replaced by natural grass), the combination of the all-grass requirement, midwinter playing season and the fact that the XFL followed shortly after the NFL had used both fields for a full season (in Giants Stadium's case, two full seasons, since the Giants and Jets shared the stadium; the Giants also hosted two playoff games following the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]]) caused significant damage to the playing fields; at Chicago's [[Soldier Field]], the wear and tear on the field was such that by midseason, the midfield logo of the Enforcers' cross-league rivals the [[Chicago Bears]] was clearly visible amid a stretch of dirt and dead grass.

Within a year of the XFL's demise, "next generation" artificial surfaces (which much more closely mimicked grass in appearance, feel and player safety) would be introduced in professional football. Giants Stadium would have a next generation artificial surface installed in 2003; Soldier Field was renovated extensively in 2002 but retained its grass field.

===Opening scramble===
Replacing the [[coin toss]] at the beginning of each game was an event in which one player from each team fought to recover a football 20 yards away in order to determine possession. Both players lined up side-by-side on one of the 30-yard lines, with the ball being placed at the 50-yard line. At the whistle, the two players would run toward the ball and attempt to gain possession; whichever player gained possession first was allowed to choose possession (as if he had won a coin toss in other leagues). The XFL's first injury infamously resulted from the opening scramble; [[Orlando Rage|Orlando]] free safety [[Hassan Shamsid-Deen]] suffered a [[separated shoulder]] prior to the Rage's 33–29 season-opening win over the [[Chicago Enforcers]] at [[Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium]] on February 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/News/020401/Sports/League_starts_in_Orla.shtml Cotey, John C. "League starts in Orlando with pageantry, pain," ''St. Petersburg'' (FL) ''Times'', Sunday, February 4, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up missing the remainder of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.dailypress.com/2001-02-07/sports/0102070013_1_vince-mcmahon-xfl-danny-snyder-s-washington-redskins Hessler, Warner. "XFL Shocking? No More Than The Redskins," ''Daily Press'' (Hampton Roads, VA), Wednesday, February 7, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===No PAT (point after touchdown) kicks===
After [[touchdown]]s there were no extra point kicks, due to the XFL's perception that an extra-point kick was a "guaranteed point." To earn a point after a touchdown, teams ran a single offensive down from the two-yard line (functionally identical to the NFL/NCAA/CFL [[two-point conversion]], but for just a single point). By the playoffs, two-point and three-point conversions had been added to the rules. Teams could opt for the bonus points by playing the conversion farther back from the goal line. However, touchdowns were still worth 6 points.

This rule, as originally implemented, was similar to the [[World Football League|WFL]]'s "Action Point", and was identical to a 1968 "Pressure Point" experiment by the NFL and [[American Football League]], used only in preseason interleague games that year.

In 2015, the NFL, CFL and other professional leagues would address the "guaranteed point" concerns by moving the extra point kick back to the 15-yard and 25-yard lines, respectively, thus making the length of the kick the same distance (taking into account the NFL's position of the goalposts on the end line, and the CFL's goalposts being positioned on the goal line).

===Overtime===
Ties were resolved in similar fashion to the NCAA and in the CFL today, with at least one possession by each team, starting from the opponent's 20-yard line. There were differences: there were no first downs&amp;nbsp;– teams had to score within four downs, and the team that had possession first in overtime could not attempt a field goal until fourth down. If that team managed to score a touchdown in fewer than four downs, the second team would only have that same number of downs to match or beat the result. If the score was still tied after one overtime period, the team that played second on offense in the first OT would start on offense in the second OT (similar to the rules of college football overtime). The process was repeated until a winner was determined&amp;nbsp;– unlike the CFL and NFL, but like college football, games could not end in ties even in the regular season.

===Bump and run===
The XFL allowed full [[bump and run coverage]] early in the season. Defensive backs were allowed to hit wide receivers any time before the quarterback released the ball, as long as the hit came from the front or the side.

Following the fourth week of the season, bump and run was restricted to the first five yards from the line of scrimmage (similar to NFL and CFL) in an effort to increase offensive production.

===Forward motion===
Unlike the [[National Football League|NFL]], but like the [[World Football League]] and [[Arena Football League]] before it&lt;!--NOT like Canadian football, which has totally different forward motion rules--&gt;, the XFL allowed one offensive player to [[motion (football)|move]] toward the line of scrimmage once he was outside the tackles.

===Punting rules===
The XFL imposed a number of restrictions on [[punt (gridiron football)|punting]] that are not present in most other leagues' rules, the net effect of which made punts in the XFL operate under rules more akin to [[kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoffs]]. The purpose of these provisions was to keep play going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back. To this effect:

*Punting out of bounds was a ten-yard [[penalty (gridiron football)|penalty]], effectively outlawing the [[coffin corner punt]] commonplace at most other levels of the game.
*Any punt that traveled at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage could be [[onside kick|recovered by the kicking team]]. Thus, instead of letting the kicking team down the ball as is common in other leagues, the receiving team was required to try and return the punt or else lose possession.
*The kicking team was prohibited from coming within five yards of the [[punt returner]] before he gained possession of the ball. This rule, known as the halo rule in college football and also common in Canadian football, was dubbed the "danger zone" in the XFL. (Coming within five yards or less of this "danger zone" was a five-yard penalty, much in the same vein as the "no yards" penalty in Canadian football.)
*[[Fair catch]]es were not recognized. (The "no fair catch" rule was one of the most heavily hyped rule differences in the XFL and a central part of the league's marketing campaign, and like the above "no yards" penalty, fair catches were not recognized in Canadian football.)

For the initial weeks of the season, the XFL forbade all players on the kicking team from going downfield before a kick was made from scrimmage on that down, similarly to a rule the NFL considered in 1974. For the rest of the season the XFL modified it to allow one player closest to each sideline downfield ahead of the kick, the same modification the NFL adopted to their change just before their 1974 exhibition games started.

Allowing the kicking team to recover a punt did encourage noticeably more [[quick kick]]s over the course of the XFL's lone season than was typically seen in the NFL over the preceding decades.

===Play clock===
The XFL used a 35-second [[play clock]], five seconds shorter than the contemporary NFL play clock of 40 seconds (but still longer than the CFL's 20 seconds), in an effort to speed up the game.

===Roster and salaries===
The XFL limited each team to an unusually low 38 players, as opposed to 53 on [[National Football League|NFL]] teams and 80 or more on unlimited college rosters. This was similar to the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], which had a comparable 40-man roster limit in 2001.  This resulted, most commonly, in each team only carrying two quarterbacks and one kicker who doubled as the punter.

The XFL paid standardized player salaries. [[Quarterback]]s earned US$5,000 per week, kickers earned $3,500, and all other uniformed players earned $4,500 per week, though a few players got around these restrictions ([[Los Angeles Xtreme]] players [[Noel Prefontaine]], the league's lone [[punter (football)|punting specialist]], and Matt Malloy, a wide receiver) by having themselves listed as backup quarterbacks. Players on a winning team received a bonus of $2,500 for the week, $7,500 for winning a [[playoff game]]. The team that won the championship game split $1,000,000 (roughly $25,000 per player). Players did not receive any fringe benefits, and had to pay for their own [[health insurance]].

===Jersey nicknames===
The XFL allowed its players to wear a nickname on the back of their jersey, as opposed to the legal last name most professional sports leagues have required since the 1960s. Players could change the nickname any time they wanted, and a few players chose to change the nicknames on a weekly basis depending on their opponent. (Two teams, Orlando&lt;ref name=letsplayfootball&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressconnects.com/story/sports/college/purdue/football/2017/07/27/lets-play-football-follows-purdues-jeff-brohm/514924001/|title=Jeff Brohm's XFL mic drop moment follows him to Purdue|work=Gannett News Service|first=Mike|last=Carmin|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Birmingham, imposed policies that forbade players from using nicknames.) The league's intent to use [[#Skycam and Bubba Cam|backfield camera angles]] gave these nicknames even greater exposure.

[[Rod Smart]], a running back who played in the first XFL nationally televised game, was the first player to gain notice from his nickname, "He Hate Me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/mlb-players-weekend-nickname-jerseys-age MLB's nickname gimmick won't solve baseball's mounting age issues]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved August 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fans love 'He Hate Me'"/&gt;

==Broadcast overview==

===Skycam and Bubba Cam===
Although the XFL was not the first football league to feature the "[[skycam|sky cam]]",&lt;ref name=skycam&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/07/sports/sp-22325|title=XFL, NBC Working Out Kinks|author=Larry Stewart|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc|Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=March 10, 2009|date=February 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enables TV viewers to see behind the offensive unit, it helped to popularize its unique capabilities. For the first several weeks, the league used the sky cam and on-field cameramen (nicknamed the "Bubba Cam" after WWE's cameraman, Bubba, who ironically refused to cover the XFL)&lt;ref name=skycam2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2011/05/16/Leagues-and-Governing-Bodies/XFL-Bubba-Cam.aspx|title=Bubba Cam put cameraman into the game|author=Terry Tefton|work=Sports Business Daily|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|accessdate=May 17, 2011|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; extensively, giving the television broadcasts a perspective similar to [[video game]]s such as the ''[[Madden NFL|Madden]]'' series.

After the XFL's failure, the sky cam was adopted by the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s broadcasters; the device has subsequently come into use on all major networks. NBC in particular switched back to the XFL camera angles in [[2017 NFL season|2017]], when traditional cameras were too far away to cut through thick fog and smoke on some of the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games that year; response was so positive that the network opted to use two of its ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games to experiment with intentionally broadcasting most of the game through that angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/nfl/index.ssf/2017/11/nbcs_skycam_will_provide_madde.html|title=NBC's 'SkyCam' will provide Madden-like view of tonight's Titans-Steelers game|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast schedule===
At the beginning of the season, NBC showed a feature game at 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on Saturday nights, also taping a second game. The second game, in some weeks, would air in the visiting team's home market and be put on the air nationally if the feature game was a blowout (as was the case in week one) or encountered technical difficulties (as was the case in week two). Two games were shown each Sunday: one at 4 p.m. Eastern on [[Paramount Network#The National Network, the New TNN and the WWE era (2000–2003)|TNN]] and another at 7 p.m. Eastern on [[UPN]]. The XFL also had a fairly extensive local radio presence, often using nationally recognized disc jockeys. The morning radio duo of [[Rick and Bubba]], for instance, was the radio broadcast team for the [[Birmingham Thunderbolts]]. [[Super Dave Osborne]] was a sideline reporter for Los Angeles Xtreme broadcasts on [[KAMP-FM|KLSX]]; [[WMVP]] carried Chicago Enforcers games.

Unusually for a professional league, the XFL did not feature a studio wraparound. The network offered ''XFL Gameday'', a pregame show featuring radio shock jocks [[Opie and Anthony]] for the first four weeks of the season, but the show was not carried nationwide and most affiliates joined in just before the game. Halftime consisted mostly of live look-ins into the player locker rooms, as coaches discussed their strategy and halftime adjustments with their players, as well as cheerleader performances. The XFL also, at McMahon's request, followed a somewhat different format than traditional professional football telecasts: the announcers more closely followed the model of professional wrestling where the [[color commentator]] had a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain-like role]], while the [[sideline reporter]]s (who were predominantly male, a rare example of the XFL being more ''conservative'' than the NFL at the time, which was incorporating attractive female sideline reporters) were former players and experienced sportscasters who were relied upon for more expert analysis than usual.

In the third week of the season, the games were sped up through changes in the playing rules, and broadcasts were subjected to increased time constraints. The reason was the reaction of [[Lorne Michaels]], creator and executive producer of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', to the length of the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] versus [[Chicago Enforcers]] game that went into double overtime. The double overtime periods combined with a power outage earlier in the game due to someone not fueling a generator before the game delayed the contest, causing the start of ''Saturday Night Live'' to be pushed back from 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time to 12:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. Sunday morning.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} This angered Michaels, who expected high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] with [[Jennifer Lopez]] as the show's host.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=172}} For the rest of the season, the XFL cut off coverage at 11:00 Eastern Time, regardless of whether or not the game was over. NBC Sports has retained this policy for other sports it runs in Saturday night time slots since the XFL's closure; in 2018, [[2018 NHL Stadium Series|a National Hockey League telecast]] was cut off under similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/03/03/lights-temporarily-go-out-navy-stadium-delaying-play-between-capitals-maple-leafs/392928002/ | title=Lights temporarily go out at Navy stadium, delaying play between Capitals, Maple Leafs | publisher=USA Today | date= March 3, 2018 | accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of declining ratings, NBC and the XFL aggressively promoted that the week 6 game between the Orlando Rage and Las Vegas Outlaws would feature a behind-the-scenes visit into the locker room of the Rage's cheerleaders at halftime. The heavily promoted event was, in fact, a [[publicity stunt]]: instead of showing an entry into the room, viewers instead saw a [[sketch comedy|sketch]] in which the cameraman knocked himself unconscious by running into the locker room door, followed by a [[dream sequence]] with little implied nudity, various fetish-related scenes, and a surprise cameo from [[Rodney Dangerfield]]. The ''New York Daily News'' reported that the scene would likely be the "[last] salacious WWF-style stunt for the rest of the season", citing internal sources indicating that NBC wished to pivot  the telecasts back towards a football-oriented product, including hiring NFL alumni as analysts, and reinstating Vasgersian as the lead commentator.&lt;ref name="nydn-cheerleaders"&gt;{{cite web|title=XFL stops going to extremes|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/xfl-stops-extremes-article-1.916919|website=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman|Daily News L.P.]]|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espn-slidebarely"&gt;{{cite web|title=XFL ends ratings slide&amp;nbsp;– just barely|url=http://www.espn.com/otherfb/xfl/news/2001/0311/1147486.html|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN Inc.|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=173}}

===Broadcast teams===
[[File:JR and The King No Mercy 07.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Jim Ross]] came over from WWE to fill similar roles on XFL broadcasts.]]
*'''NBC (national telecasts)''':
**Week 1, 6–10: [[Matt Vasgersian]], [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Fred Roggin]] and [[Mike Adamle]]. [[Chris Wragge]] replaced Roggin for at least Week 6.
**Week 2–5: [[Jim Ross]], Ventura, Roggin and Adamle
*'''NBC (regional telecasts)''':
**Week 1: Ross, [[Jerry Lawler]], [[Jonathan Coachman]]. For week 1, Ross and Lawler were billed as their WWE personas, "J.R." and "The King."
**Week 2–5: Vasgersian, Lawler, and Coachman. McMahon personally demoted Vasgersian to the regional telecast after openly criticizing a suggestive shot of the cheerleaders as "uncomfortable" on-air during the week 1 broadcast.
**Week 6–10: Ross, [[Dick Butkus]] and Coachman. Lawler left the XFL (and WWE) in protest after week five in the aftermath of the firing of his then-wife, [[Stacy Carter]], as well as his own dissatisfaction with being pressured into commentary on XFL games; Lawler openly admitted on-air that he had virtually no interest or background in football, an unusual trait for a color analyst. After Lawler's departure, NBC brought Vasgersian back up to the main broadcast team.
*'''TNN''': [[Craig Minervini]], [[Bob Golic]], [[Lee Reherman]] and Kip Lewis.
*'''UPN''': [[Chris Marlowe]], [[Brian Bosworth]], [[Chris Wragge]] and [[Michael Barkann]].

==Critical reception==
It was believed that the willingness of Las Vegas bookmakers to take bets on XFL games established their legitimacy, dispelling concerns that the league was using predetermined storylines as in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name="sentinel-betting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xfl Bets On Gambling To Bring Out Fans|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-03/news/0102030271_1_bookies-football-league-las-vegas|website=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mentalfloss-xfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Good, Honest Football: Re-Watching the XFL|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58829/good-honest-football-re-watching-xfl|website=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the league was panned by critics as boring football with a tawdry broadcast style, although the broadcasts on TNN and to a lesser extent UPN and the [[Matt Vasgersian]]–helmed NBC coverage were considered comparatively professional.{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=59}}

==End of season and failure==

The WWF and NBC each lost a reported $35 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=105329 |title=XFL Is Down for the Count |date=May 11, 2001 |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[Disney-ABC Television Group]] |accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; only recuperating 30% of their combined initial $100 million investment.&lt;ref name=skycam/&gt; On April 21, 2001, the season concluded as the [[Los Angeles Xtreme]] defeated the [[San Francisco Demons]] 38–6 in the XFL Championship Game (which was originally given the moniker "The Big Game at the End of the Season", but was later dubbed the [[Million Dollar Game]], after the amount of money awarded to the winning team).

Though paid attendance at games remained respectable, if unimpressive (overall attendance was only 10% below what the league's goal had been at the start of the season), the XFL ceased operations after just one season due to low TV ratings.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE drops XFL|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/05/10/news/xfl/|work=[[CNNMoney]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=May 10, 2001|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=No More Springtimes for the XFL as League Folds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/sports/pro-football-no-more-springtimes-for-the-xfl-as-league-folds.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=May 11, 2001|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing stiff competition from the [[2001 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], the NBC telecast of the Chicago/NY-NJ game on March 31 received a 1.5 rating, at that time the lowest ever for any major network [[primetime]] weekend first-run sports television broadcast in the United States.{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=211}}

Despite initially agreeing to broadcast XFL games for two years and owning half of the league, NBC announced it would not broadcast a second XFL season; the network no longer had a full season of Saturday nights to offer the league because it had acquired the rights to the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], even if the XFL had been more successful or profitable. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon initially announced that the XFL would continue, as it still had UPN and TNN as broadcast outlets.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=176}} In fact, expansion teams were being explored for cities such as Washington, D.C. and [[Detroit]]. However, in order to continue broadcasting XFL games, UPN demanded that ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown!]]'' broadcasts be cut from two hours to one and a half hours.{{sfn|Fritz|Murray|2006|page=176}} McMahon found these terms unacceptable and he announced the XFL's closure on May 10, 2001.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; McMahon's chief adviser, a perplexed Nathan Livian, was quoted as saying "the situation is, indeed, very bad".

One reason for the failure of the league to catch on, despite its financial solvency and massive visibility, was the lack of respect for the league in the sports media.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} XFL games were rarely treated as sports contests, but rather more like WWF-like sensationalized events. With few NFL-quality players, save [[Tommy Maddox]], the league's MVP, and with little thoughtful analysis or even consideration by sports columnists, the XFL never gained the necessary recognition to be regarded as a viable league. The fact that the league was co-owned by NBC made ESPN (which was part of the [[The Walt Disney Company|same corporation]] as ABC) and Fox Sports Net (owned by Fox TV) disinclined to report on the XFL, though [[Time Warner]] properties such as ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', as well as the [[Associated Press]], devoted coverage to the league (''Sports Illustrated'' even [[Sports Illustrated cover jinx|featured the XFL on the cover]] of its February 12, 2001, edition, albeit with the description of it being "sleazy gimmicks and low-rent football"). Many local TV newscasts and newspapers (even in XFL cities) did not report league scores or show highlights. This led to many football fans treating the XFL as a joke, rather than competition to the NFL.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other problems included the scantily-clad cheerleaders, trash-talking announcers, and the lack of penalties for roughness.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The XFL ranked No. 3 on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the TV Guide's worst TV shows of all time in July 2002, as well as No. 2 on [[ESPN]]'s list of biggest flops in sports, behind [[Ryan Leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/12/entertainment/main515057.shtml|title=The Worst TV Shows Ever|author=Cosgrove-Mather, Bootie|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2010-07-27|date=2002-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/25biggestflops|title=ESPN 25: The 25 Biggest Sports Flops|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Inc.|accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[TV Guide Network]] also listed the show at No. 21 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News&amp;nbsp;– TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=March 2, 2010|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many stories recapping the history of the XFL show photos of the crash of its promotional blimp in [[Oakland, California]], portraying it retrospectively as an ill-omen for the league. The incident occurred a month before the opening game on Tuesday, January 9, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 10, 2001|title=XFL'S UNPLANNED TOUCHDOWN / Wayward blimp's wild, woolly flight ends in Oakland crash|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/XFL-S-UNPLANNED-TOUCHDOWN-Wayward-blimp-s-wild-2966749.php|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 10, 2001|title=Crash Mouth Football: XFL Promo Blimp In Bay Area Deflates|publisher=Sports Business Daily|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2001/01/Issue-76/Sponsorships-Advertising-Marketing/Crash-Mouth-Football-XFL-Promo-Blimp-In-Bay-Area-Deflates.aspx|newspaper=Sports Business Daily|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blimp was in Oakland as the league had flown it over the [[2000–01 NFL playoffs#AFC: Oakland Raiders 27, Miami Dolphins 0|January 6 playoff game]] between the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] and intended to do the same with the following week's AFC Championship, also in Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Martin J. |last2=Kiger |first2=Patrick J. |date=2006 |title=Oops: 20 Life Lessons from the Fiascoes That Shaped America |location=New York |publisher=Collins |page=218 |isbn=0-06-078083-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots lost control of the airship and were forced to evacuate. The ground crew were unable to secure the vehicle and the "unattended blimp then floated five miles north over the Oakland Estuary, at one point reaching 1,600 feet, until its gondola caught on a sailboat mast in the Central Basin marina. It draped over the roof of the Oyster Reef restaurant—next to where the boat was moored—and a nearby power line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January 31, 2001|title=Blimp crashes into Oakland restaurant|newspaper=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Inc.|agency=Associated Press|url=http://espn.go.com/moresports/news/2001/0110/1005983.html|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the pilot was hospitalized, no other major injuries were reported. The blimp needed $2.5 million in repairs, the sailboat and restaurant had only minor damages.

Before the season started, a fictional XFL game appeared in the 2000 film ''[[The 6th Day]]'', set in 2015.&lt;ref name="ABready"&gt;{{cite web|title=XFL Ready To Line It Up|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4474381-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206135623/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4474381-1.html|archivedate=December 6, 2007|date=January 19, 2001|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
NBC continued airing professional league football beyond the demise of the XFL, starting with the [[Arena Football League]] [[AFL on NBC|television coverage from 2003 to 2006]]. In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], NBC returned to coverage of NFL games with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'', eventually adding ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' to its coverage in [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. McMahon and Ebersol later took credit for the more intimate approach to televising football, with innovations such as the Skycam, miked-up players, and sideline interviews that were later used in NFL broadcasts.

XFL team names and logos sometimes appear in movies and television where professional football needs to be dramatized, as licensing for NFL logos may be cost prohibitive (such as in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] starring sci-fi film ''[[The 6th Day]]'').&lt;ref name="ABready" /&gt;

The [[United Football League (2009–12)|United Football League]] later placed all four of its inaugural franchises in former XFL markets and stadiums. However, the UFL drew far fewer fans than the XFL average: for example, the XFL's [[San Francisco Demons]] drew an average of 35,000 fans, while the UFL's [[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]] drew an average of 6,000, despite both playing in the same ballpark. Three of the four charter teams, including the Redwoods, moved to other markets by the time of the UFL's [[2011 UFL season|third season]].

[[ESPN]] produced a [[documentary film|documentary]] surrounding the league, ''This Was the XFL'', as part of its anthology series ''[[30 for 30]]''. The film discusses the longtime friendship between McMahon and Ebersol, as seen through the eyes of Dick's son, [[Charlie Ebersol]], who directs the film. McMahon, Dick Ebersol, Dick Schanzer, [[Rusty Tillman]], [[Al Luginbill]], [[Rod Smart]], [[Tommy Maddox]], [[Paris Lenon]], league President Basil DeVito, costume designer Jay Howarth, [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Matt Vasgersian]], [[Jonathan Coachman]], [[Bob Costas]] and [[Jerry Jones]] all provided interviews for the film. It debuted at [[Doc NYC]] November 11, 2016, and premiered on ESPN on February 2, 2017.&lt;ref name="avclub-3030xfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=30 For 30 shrugs at the train wreck that was the XFL|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/30-30-shrugs-train-wreck-was-xfl-249297|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable players==
Notable players included league [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] and Los Angeles quarterback [[Tommy Maddox]], who signed with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] after the XFL folded (Maddox later became the starting quarterback for the Steelers in 2002 and led them to that year's playoffs, as well as continuing to start for them into 2004). Los Angeles used the first pick in the [[2001 XFL Draft|XFL draft]] to select a former [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback, Scott Milanovich. Milanovich lost the starting quarterback job to Maddox, who was placed on the Xtreme as one of a handful of players put on each team due to geographic distance between the player's college and the team's hometown. Another of the better-known players was Las Vegas [[running back]] [[Rod Smart]], who first gained popularity because the name on the back of his jersey read "[[Rod Smart#"He Hate Me"|He Hate Me]]."{{sfn|Forrest|2002|p=89}} Smart, who was only picked 357th in the draft, later went on to play for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Carolina Panthers]], [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the CFL. His Panther teammate [[Jake Delhomme]] named his newborn horse "She Hate Me" as a reference to him.&lt;ref name="Fans love 'He Hate Me'"&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=203873 JS Online: Fans love 'He Hate Me'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513000000/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=203873 |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart played in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] becoming one of seven XFL players to play in a Super Bowl.  Receiver [[Yo Murphy]] also achieved this as a member of the [[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis Rams]] in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] along with winning the 95th [[Grey Cup]] with the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomurphy.com/facts.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619052630/http://www.yomurphy.com/facts.htm |date=June 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tommy Maddox played for a Super Bowl team (with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]) in [[Super Bowl XL]] in [[Detroit]], (although Maddox, by then a third-string quarterback, did not play in the game, which turned out to be his last appearance in uniform before retiring). Lastly, Las Vegas Outlaws DB [[Kelly Herndon]] played in [[Super Bowl XL]] with the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in 2005, where he is remembered for intercepting a pass and returning it a then-record 76 yards.  Although he did not play for an NFL team after the XFL's lone season, former Las Vegas Outlaw offensive guard [[Isaac Davis (American football)|Isaac Davis]] also had a notable NFL career, playing in 58 games over a six-year career.  Davis started for the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[Super Bowl XXIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/isaacdavis/gamelogs?id=DAV484459&amp;season=1994|title=Isaac Davis: Game Logs at NFL.com|website=www.nfl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Avery (American football)|John Avery]] went on to play for both the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] and the [[Toronto Argonauts]] where he was an All Star selection in 2002 and won a [[Grey Cup]] in 2004.

The last active player to have played in the XFL is Canadian placekicker [[Paul McCallum (Canadian football)|Paul McCallum]], who retired as a member of the [[BC Lions]] prior to the start of the [[2016 CFL season]], but returned to the team as their place kicker during the final regular season game of the 2016 season.

==Current status and planned revival==
{{main|XFL (2020)}}
XFL games are now part of the [[WWE Video Library]].

In September 2012, WWE attempted to file a new XFL trademark for use in wrestling and football which was previously filed in 2009 under XFL LLC. The application is still pending since WWE has not put together a "Statement of Use" for the trademark. WWE could consider abandoning the old application and filing the new one under WWE Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/254196/Various-News:--XFL-Back-in-the-News,-Chris-Jericho,-and-More.htm |title=Various News: XFL Back in the News, Chris Jericho, and More |publisher=411MANIA |date=2012-09-09 |accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the XFL's first trademark extension was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/xfl-85720169.html |title=XFL&amp;nbsp;– Reviews &amp; Brand Information&amp;nbsp;– World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

On December 15, 2017, it was reported that McMahon was seriously considering a revival of the XFL. WWE didn't confirm or deny the rumors, but released a statement that McMahon is launching a new company known as Alpha Entertainment, that is looking to expand into sports and entertainment properties "including professional football", and that WWE itself wasn't returning to professional football.&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/will-the-xfl-actually-be-making-a-return-wwe-is-not-exactly-denying-the-rumors|title=Will the XFL actually be making a return?

Noted wrestling journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] speculated that McMahon was starting a [[shell corporation]] with his own money to protect WWE shareholders on a potential XFL revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvzE1vfnrP8|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revival of the XFL would air either on traditional TV or the [[WWE Network]], and would be toned down compared to its original incarnation due to [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]] concerns in football that surfaced in the early 2010s.&lt;ref name="revival" /&gt; On December 22, 2017, McMahon sold $100 million worth of WWE shares, which required notification to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]; the SEC reported that it was done so that McMahon could fund Alpha Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/12/21/vince-mcmahon-sells-100-million-of-wwe-stock-as-xfl-reboot-plan-continues/|title=Vince McMahon sells $100 million of WWE stock as XFL reboot plan continues|date=21 December 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE shares did in fact decline slightly due to the report, with [[Citigroup]] downgrading WWE shares from "buy" to "neutral".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2017/12/22/wwe-stock-falls-after-ceo-mcmahon-sells-shares|title=WWE Stock Falls After CEO McMahon Sells Shares  - Schaeffer's Investment Research|first=Josh|last=Selway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
