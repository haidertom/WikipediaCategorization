      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Afro-pessimism''' is a framework and critical idiom that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of enslavement including the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], and their impact on structural conditions as well as personal, subjective, and lived experience, and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality. 

The term was first coined  in 1990 in an article in ''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeune Afrique Economie]]'' by Francophone Cameroonian author [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71173671 |title=African literature : an anthology of criticism and theory |last=Tansi |first=Sony Labou |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub |isbn=1405112018 |location=Malden, MA |pages=54-60 |chapter=An Open Letter to Africans c/o The Punic One Party State |oclc=71173671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Labou Tansi, "Lettre aux Africains... sous couvert du parti punique," ''Jeune Afrique Economie 1''36 (1990): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[intellectual]] [[Frank B. Wilderson III]] developed the term in his political [[memoir]] about his time spent teaching and participating in the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] during [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/9780822374985-003|work=Incognegro|pages=96–146|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822374985|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Tansi, "Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time," which is the "tragedy" that Africa's position "dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of "accumulation and fungibility" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.

Wilderson, along with [[Hortense Spillers]], [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Jared Sexton]], and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the [[Martinique|Martinician]] psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer [[Frantz Fanon]] as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. 

Afro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a [[wikt:transcendence|transcendent]] position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that [[pessimism]] might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of [[African descent]]. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling [[white supremacy]] would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the [[modern world]].

Discussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an [[online]] context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, [[poetics]], and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Afro-Pessimism:The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|date=2016|issue=29|url=http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|issn=1555-9998|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907061732/http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|archive-date=2017-09-07|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Africanism ==
Afro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about [[pan-African]] identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the [[African Diaspora]] and peoples on the [[Africa|African continent]]. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentricity]] as a move away from the colonialism and violence of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]]. The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], a [[Martinique|Martinican]] psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. 

=== Négritude ===
The [[Pan-African]] movement [[négritude]] represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an [[existentialist]] position. A key figure in the movement, [[Aimé Césaire]], uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.

==In international relations theory==
Afro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilderson|first1=Frank|title=Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4692-0|page=346|oclc=457770963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood.&lt;ref name="de B'eberi and Louw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de B’béri |first1=Boulou Ebanda |last2=Louw |first2=P.

In this ways the media tends to victimize and exoticize Africa for its going struggles with poverty, health-crisis, famine, and lack of modern development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bassil |first1=Noah R. |title=The roots of Afropessimism: the British invention of the 'dark continent.' |journal=Critical Arts: South-North Cultural and Media Studies |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2011-10-13 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=377-396 |issn=0256-0046 |doi=10.1080/02560046.2011.615141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victimization is then visible in the [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and development projects, which sometimes use the language of "saving" African people from such "humanitarian disasters".&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, the terminology evolved. 
==Argument==
An '''[[argument]]''', more fully a premise-conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is [[Validity (logic)|''valid'']] [[if and only if]] its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument ''per se''; such must come from the outside. 

Every argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word ''constituent'' may be used for either a premise or conclusion.In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of [[truth-bearer]]: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc.

==Deduction==
A '''deduction''' is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates — steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a [[logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a [[deductive argument]]. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as [[Venn diagrams]] and other graphic procedures have been proposed.

==Proof==
A '''[[Formal proof|proof]]''' is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is a deduction that might use several premises — [[axiom]]s, postulates, and definitions — and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As [[Alfred Tarski]] famously emphasized in accord with [[Aristotle]], truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.
==Comparison==
Premise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. 
Deductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions.
Proofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions.
==Context==
Modern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents.[[Willard Van Orman Quine| Quine]] devotes the first chapter of ''Philosophy of Logic'' to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;WILLARD QUINE, ''Philosophy of logic'', Harvard, 1970/1986. &lt;/ref&gt; Historians have not even been able to agree on what [[Aristotle]] took as constituents.&lt;ref&gt; JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's syllogistic premises. Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 18 (2012) 300–1. &lt;/ref&gt;


Argument-deduction-proof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the ''consequence-deducibility'' distinction and the ''truth-and-consequence conception of proof''.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; Variations among argument-deduction-proof distinctions are not all terminological.

Logician [[Alonzo Church]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church
  |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic
  |publisher=Princeton University Press
  |year=1956
|isbn=9780691029061}}&lt;/ref&gt; never used the word ''argument'' in the above sense and had no synonym. Moreover, Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun ''deduction'' for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.

The absence of argument-deduction-proof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed [[Plato]]nistic logicism. Following [[Michael Dummett|Dummett's]] insightful remarks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], which — ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' — apply even more to Church, it might be possible to explain the today-surprising absence.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
The '''Boehm system''' is a system of [[key (instrument)|keywork]] for the [[flute]], created by [[inventor]] and [[flautist]] [[Theobald Boehm]] between 1831 and 1847.  

Prior to the development of the Boehm system, flutes were most commonly made of wood, with an inverse conical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], eight keys, and [[tone hole]]s (the openings where the fingers are placed to produce specific notes) that were small in size, and thus easily covered by the fingertips.  Boehm's work was inspired by an 1831 concert in London, given by soloist [[Charles Nicholson (flautist)|Charles Nicholson]] who, with his father in the 1820s, had introduced a flute constructed with larger tone holes than were used in previous designs.  This large-holed instrument could produce greater volume of sound than other flutes, and Boehm set out to produce his own large-holed design.

In addition to large holes, Boehm provided his flute with "full venting", meaning that all keys were normally open (previously, several keys were normally closed, and opened only when the key was operated).  Boehm also wanted to locate tone holes at acoustically optimal points on the body of the instrument, rather than locations conveniently covered by the player's fingers.  To achieve these goals, Boehm adapted a system of axle-mounted keys with a series of "open rings" (called ''brille'', German for "eyeglasses", as they resembled the type of eyeglass frames common during the 19th century) that were fitted around other tone holes, such that the closure of one tone hole by a finger would also close a key placed over a second hole.

In 1832 Boehm introduced a new conical-bore flute, which achieved a fair degree of success.  Boehm, however, continued to look for ways to improve the instrument.  Finding that an increased volume of air produced a stronger and clearer tone, he replaced the conical bore with a cylindrical bore, finding that a parabolic contraction of the bore near the [[embouchure]] hole improved the instrument's [[Register (music)|low register]].  He also found that optimal tone was produced when the tone holes were too large to be covered by the fingertips, and he developed a system of finger plates to cover the holes.  These new flutes were at first made of [[silver]], although Boehm later produced wooden versions.  

The cylindrical Boehm flute was introduced in 1847, with the instrument gradually being adopted almost universally by professional and amateur players in Europe and around the world during the second half of the 19th century. The instrument was adopted for the performance of orchestral and chamber music, opera and theater, wind ensembles (e.g., military and civic bands), and most other music which might be loosely described as relating to "[[Western classical music]]" (including, for example, [[jazz]]). Many further refinements have been made, and countless design variations are common among flutes today (the "offset G" key, addition of the low B foot, etc.) The concepts of the Boehm system have been applied across the range of flutes available, including [[piccolo]]s, [[alto flute]]s, [[bass flute]]s, and so on, as well as other wind instruments. The material of the instrument may vary (many piccolos are made of wood, some very large flutes are wooden or even made of [[PVC]]).

The [[flute]] is perhaps the oldest musical instrument, other than the human voice itself. There are very many flutes, both traversely blown and end-blown "[[fipple]]" flutes, currently produced which are not built on the Boehm model.

The fingering system for the [[saxophone]] closely resembles the Boehm system. A key system inspired by Boehm's for the [[clarinet]] family is also known as the "[[Boehm system (clarinet)|Boehm system]]", although it was developed by [[Hyacinthe Klosé]] and not Boehm himself.  The Boehm system was also adapted for a small number of [[flageolet]]s. Boehm did work on a system for the [[bassoon]], and Boehm-inspired [[oboe]]s have been made, but non-Boehm systems remain predominant for these instruments. The [[Albert system]] is another key system for the clarinet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1634">'''Comply or explain''' is a regulatory approach used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries in the field of corporate governance and financial supervision. Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the [[Financial Reporting Council]], in Germany, under the [[Aktiengesetz]]) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], the [[German Corporate Governance Code]] (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' ([[:nl:code-Tabaksblat]]) use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their [[audit]] committees, [[remuneration]] committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.

The purpose of "comply or explain" is to "let the market decide" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that "one size fits all", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a "market sanction", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the [[Cadbury Report]] of 1992.

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''concept map''' or '''conceptual diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that depicts suggested relationships between [[concept]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Hager, Nancy C. Corbin. ''Designing &amp; Delivering: Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Presentations,'' 1997, . 163.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a graphical tool that [[instructional designer]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[Technical communication|technical writers]], and others use to organize and structure [[knowledge]].

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in '''linking phrases''' such as ''causes'', ''requires'', or ''contributes to''.&lt;ref name=theory&gt;[[Joseph D. Novak]] &amp; Alberto J. Cañas (2006). [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryCmaps/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.htm "The Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct and Use Them"], [[Institute for Human and Machine Cognition]]. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique for [[Visualization (graphic)|visualizing]] these relationships among different concepts is called ''concept mapping''. Concept maps have been used to define the [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] of computer systems, for example with the [[object-role modeling]] or [[Unified Modeling Language]] formalism.

== Overview ==
A concept map is a way of representing relationships between [[idea]]s, [[image]]s, or [[word]]s in the same way that a [[sentence diagram]] represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a [[circuit diagram]] represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.{{clarify|why is this noteworthy?|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="CMP"&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf CONCEPT MAPPING FUELS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062626/http://www.energyeducation.tx.gov/pdf/223_inv.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}. Accessed 24 Nov 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept maps were developed{{according to whom|date=November 2016}} to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. A well-made concept map grows within a ''context frame'' defined by an explicit "focus question", while a [[mind map]] often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on [[declarative memory]] content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., &amp; Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., &amp; Qin, Y. (2004). An Integrated Theory of the Mind. Psychological Review, 111(4), 1036&amp;ndash;1050.&lt;/ref&gt; Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.

== Differences from other visualizations ==

* ''Topic maps'': Concept maps are rather similar to [[topic map]]s in that both allow to concepts or topics via [[graph (data structure)|graphs]]. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, and organizations, concept mapping, as developed by [[Joseph D. Novak|Joseph Novak]] is unique in its philosophical basis, which "makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J.D. &amp; Gowin, D.B. (1996). Learning How To Learn, Cambridge University Press: New York, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mind maps'': Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with [[mind mapping]], which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s. Another contrast between concept mapping and mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a mind map is created. A mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. A concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which typically emerge from a single center.

== History ==
Concept mapping was developed by [[Joseph D. Novak]] and his research team at [[Cornell University]] in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihmc.us/users/user.php?UserID=jnovak|title=Joseph D. Novak|publisher=Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)|accessdate=2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been used as a tool to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin  in the learning movement called [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.

Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of [[David Ausubel]], who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or ''assimilate'') new concepts: "The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as "What is water?" "What causes the seasons?" In his book ''Learning How to Learn'', Novak states that a "meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures."

Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of ''off-loading''. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa&lt;ref&gt;Sowa, J.F., 1983. ''Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine'', Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper by Sweller &amp; Chandler.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J. &amp; Chandler, P., 1991. Evidence for Cognitive Load Theory. ''Cognition and Instruction'', 8(4), p.351-362.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using ''nodes'' and ''relationships'', allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R. (1998) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6(3), p.251–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know.&lt;ref&gt;Birbili, M. (2006) [http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v8n2/birbili.html "Mapping Knowledge: Concept Maps in Early Childhood Education"], ''Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice'', ''8(2)'', Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''knowledge arena'' is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.

==Use==
[[Image:Conceptmap.png|thumb|450px|Example concept map created using the IHMC CmapTools computer program.]]
Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="theory"/&gt; Concept mapping is also sometimes used for [[brain-storming]]. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Formalized concept maps are used in [[software design]], where a common usage is [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument &amp;mdash; similar to [[argument map]]s.

Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include:
*[[Note taking]] and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials
*New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming [[tacit knowledge]] into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge
*Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement
*Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge
*Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization
*Instructional design: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advance organizers" that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning.
*Training: concept maps used as [[David Ausubel|Ausubelian]] "advanced organizers" to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization's strategic objectives, to training goals.
*Communicating complex ideas and arguments
*Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology
*Detailing the entire structure of an idea, [[train of thought]], or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one's own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others.
*Enhancing [[metacognition]] (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge)
*Improving language ability
*Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts
*Lexicon development

Concept is usually perceived as a regularity in events or objects or in their records. While constructing a [[concept map]], it is essential to keep in mind that the concept be built with reference to a focus question. Hence, initially, the focus question to which we seek to answer is carefully chosen because learners usually tend to deviate from this question relating only to domains and thus, fails to answer the question.

With the selected domain and the focus question, the next step is to identify the key concepts which apply to this domain.About 15 to 25 concepts is sufficient which is usually ordered in a rank ordered list. Such list should be established from the most general and inclusive concept for the particular chosen problem. This list will assist in at least in the beginning of the construction of the concept map. The list is referred to as Parking Lot since the list is constantly shuffled to build up the required network of the concept. Two or more concepts are connected to each other using linking words or phrases which can only then complete a meaningful sentence.Another important characteristics of a concept map is the [[cross-link]]s.  This cross link acts as the relationship between two different domains  used in the concept map.This helps in a clear representation of the knowledge contained in the concept and also gives a clear background with specific examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/howto/assesslearning/conceptmaps.html |title=Concept Maps - Enhancing Education - Carnegie Mellon University |publisher=Cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

===Modern tests===

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

{{cosmology}}
In modern [[physical cosmology]], the '''cosmological principle''' is the notion that the spatial distribution of matter in the universe is [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] and [[Isotropy|isotropic]] when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large-scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the [[Big Bang]].

==Definition==
Astronomer William Keel explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.&lt;ref name=Keel&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Galaxy Formation (2nd ed.) |author=William C. Keel |isbn=978-3-540-72534-3 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cosmological principle depends on a definition of "observer," and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences.

"Observers" means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, "the cosmological principle [means that] the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are."&lt;ref name=Liddle&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.) |author=Andrew Liddle |isbn=978-0-470-84835-7 |year=2003 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the Sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a "foamy" texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics.

The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]]. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ("the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe ("the same physical laws apply throughout" {{dubious|Homogeneity vs isotropy|date=September 2016}}). The principles are distinct but closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.

== Origin ==
The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) of Isaac Newton.{{dubious|it is debatable that Newton stated the cosmological principle in the form we intend at this day and age.|date=May 2018}} In contrast to earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of universe, Newton conceptualized the Earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the Sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of "[[universal gravitation]]" that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the Moon around the Earth, the Earth around the Sun, and to falling bodies on Earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself.

== Implications ==
Observations show that more distant galaxies are closer together and have lower content of chemical elements heavier than lithium.&lt;ref name="CMB_Timeline300"&gt;[[:Image:CMB Timeline75.jpg]] - NASA (public domain image)&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the cosmological principle, this suggests that heavier elements were not created in the Big Bang but were produced by [[nucleosynthesis]] in giant stars and expelled across a series of supernovae explosions and new star formation from the supernovae remnants, which means heavier elements would accumulate over time. Another observation is that the furthest galaxies (earlier time) are often more fragmentary, interacting and unusually shaped than local galaxies (recent time), suggesting evolution in galaxy structure as well.

A related implication of the cosmological principle is that the largest discrete structures in the universe are in [[mechanical equilibrium]]. Homogeneity and isotropy of matter at the largest scales would suggest that the largest discrete structures are parts of a single indiscrete form, like the crumbs which make up the interior of a cake. At extreme cosmological distances, the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested; however, under the assumption of the cosmological principle, it cannot be detected parallel to the line of sight (see [[timeline of the formation of the Universe|timeline of the universe]]).

Cosmologists agree that in accordance with observations of distant galaxies, a universe must be non-static if it follows the cosmological principle. In 1923, [[Alexander Friedmann]] set out a variant of [[Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] that describe the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic universe.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Welt als Raum und Zeit (The World as Space and Time) |publisher=Ostwalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften |author=[[Alexander Friedmann]] |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/248202523&amp;referer=brief_results  |isbn=3-8171-3287-5  |year=1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abramovitch&gt;{{cite book |page=219 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DPC4a0CSq4C&amp;pg=PA219 |isbn=0-521-38470-2 |year=1993 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |title=Alexander A. Friedmann: The Man who Made the Universe Expand |author1=Ėduard Abramovich Tropp |author2=Viktor Ya. Frenkel |author3=Artur Davidovich Chernin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, [[Georges Lemaître]] derived in 1927 the equations of an expanding universe from the General Relativity equations.&lt;ref name=Lemaitre1927&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Un univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques | year=1927 | journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | issue=5 | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L | pages=49–56 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }} ''translated by [[A. S. Eddington]]'': {{Cite journal | last=Lemaître | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lemaître | title=Expansion of the universe, A homogeneous universe of constant mass and increasing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extra-galactic nebulæ | year=1931 | journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume=91 | bibcode=1931MNRAS..91..483L | pages=483–490 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | doi=10.1093/mnras/91.5.483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a non-static universe is also implied, independent of observations of distant galaxies, as the result of applying the cosmological principle to [[general relativity]].

== Criticism ==
[[Karl Popper]] criticized the cosmological principle on the grounds that it makes "our ''lack'' of knowledge a principle of ''knowing something''". He summarized his position as:
:the “cosmological principles” were, I fear, dogmas that should not have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh: [http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9062/1/Popper_%26_cosmology_PhilSci.pdf “The most philosophically of all the sciences”: Karl Popper and physical cosmology] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations ==
Although the universe is inhomogeneous at smaller scales, it ''is'' statistically homogeneous on scales larger than 250 million light years. The [[cosmic microwave background]] is isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/universe-homogeneous-300-million-light-years/24149/]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent findings have called this view into question. Data from the [[Planck Mission]] shows hemispheric bias in 2 respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). Therefore, the [[European Space Agency]] (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored.&lt;ref name="Planck"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sci.esa.int/planck/51551-simple-but-challenging-the-universe-according-to-planck/ | title=Simple but challenging: the Universe according to Planck | work=[[ESA Science &amp; Technology]] | origyear=March 21, 2013 |date= October 5, 2016 | accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inconsistencies===
The ''cosmological principle'' implies that at a sufficiently large scale, the universe is [[homogeneous]]. This means that different places will appear similar to one another, so sufficiently large structures cannot exist{{clarify|what is actually meant by existence of a structure here?|date=April 2017}}. Yadav and his colleagues have suggested a maximum scale of 260[[Parsec#Megaparsecs and gigaparsecs|/h Mpc]] for structures within the universe according to this{{which|date=April 2017}} [[heuristic]]. Other authors have suggested values as low as 60/h Mpc.&lt;ref name=Yadav&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yadav|first=Jaswant |author2=J. S. Bagla |author3=Nishikanta Khandai|title=Fractal dimension as a measure of the scale of homogeneity|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=25 February 2010|volume=405|issue=3|pages=2009–2015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16612.x |arxiv = 1001.0617 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2009Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yadav's calculation suggests that the maximum size of a structure can be about 370&amp;nbsp;Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clowers |first=Roger G. |year=2013 |title=A structure in the early universe at z ~ 1.3 that exceeds the homogeneity scale of the R-W concordance cosmology |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=429 |issue=4 |pages=2910–2916|arxiv=1211.6256 |bibcode=2013MNRAS.429.2910C |doi= 10.1093/mnras/sts497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of observations conflict with predictions of maximal structure sizes:

*The [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], discovered in 1991, has a length of 580 Mpc, and is marginally larger than the consistent scale.
*The [[Sloan Great Wall]], discovered in 2003, has a length of 423 Mpc,&lt;ref name=apj624_2_463&gt;{{Cite journal | display-authors=1 | last1=Gott | first1=J. Richard, III | last2=Jurić | first2=Mario | last3=Schlegel| first3=David | last4=Hoyle | first4=Fiona | last5=Vogeley | first5=Michael | last6=Tegmark | first6=Max | last7=Bahcall | first7=Neta |last8=Brinkmann | first8=Jon | title=A Map of the Universe | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=624 | issue=2 | pages=463–484 |date=May 2005 | doi=10.1086/428890 | bibcode=2005ApJ...624..463G |arxiv = astro-ph/0310571}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is only just consistent with the cosmological principle.
*[[U1.11]], a [[large quasar group]] discovered in 2011, has a length of 780 Mpc, and is two times larger than the upper limit of the homogeneity scale.
*The [[Huge-LQG]], discovered in 2012, is three times longer than, and twice as wide as is predicted possible according to these current models, and so challenges our understanding of the universe on large scales.
*In November 2013, a new structure 10 billion light years away measuring 2000-3000 Mpc (more than seven times that of the SGW) has been discovered, the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]], putting further doubt on the validity of the cosmological principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1311.1104|last1= Horvath|first1= I.|title= The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts|last2=  Hakkila|first2= J.|last3=  Bagoly|first3= Z.|class= astro-ph.CO|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, however, studies of the expansion of the Universe that have used data taken by the ''[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]'' mission show it to be highly [[isotropy|isotropical]], reinforcing the cosmological principle&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07178 How isotropic is the Universe?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect cosmological principle==
The '''perfect cosmological principle''' is an extension of the cosmological principle, and states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space ''and'' time. In this view the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. The perfect cosmological principle underpins [[Steady State theory]] and emerges{{clarify|underpins emerging? does this mean underpins the emergence of something (unstated) from chaotic inflation theory?|date=April 2017}} from [[chaotic inflation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aguirre, Anthony|author2=Gratton, Steven|last-author-amp=yes|title=Inflation without a beginning: A null boundary proposal|journal= Phys.

'''Distinction''', the fundamental philosophical [[abstraction]], involves the recognition of difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|date=1998-01-01|title=The Method of Philosophy: Making Distinctions|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SOKTMO|journal=Review of Metaphysics|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of [[Ontology|ontological]] separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmhCGt9hKC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=copleston+history+of+philosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKq8HBtozTAhUIRCYKHecUDC8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=formal%20distinction&amp;f=false|title=History of Philosophy Volume 2: Medieval Philosophy|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|date=2003-06-12|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826468963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized.

Later developments include [[Duns Scotus|Duns Scotus's]] [[formal distinction]], which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wengert|first=R. G.|last2=Institute|first2=The Hegeler|date=1965-11-01|title=The Development of the Doctrine of the Formal Distinction in the Lectura Prima of John Duns Scotus|url=https://www.pdcnet.org//pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=monist&amp;id=monist_1965_0049_0004_0571_0587&amp;onlyautologin=true|journal=Monist|volume=49|issue=4|pages=571–587|doi=10.5840/monist196549435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Inductive reasoning|Inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|Deductive]]

== Distinctions in Contemporary Thought ==

=== [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]] ===
While the there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British [[Empiricism|Empiricists]] (and even further in [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in "All bodies are extended." Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in "All events are caused." The distinction was recently called into question by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]], in his paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]."

=== [[A priori and a posteriori|''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'']] ===
The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of [[knowledge]]. ''A posteriori'' knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. ''A priori'' knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. [[Saul Kripke]] was the first major think to propose that there are analytic ''a posteriori'' knowledge claims.

== Notable Distinctions in Historical Authors ==

=== Aristotle ===
[[Aristotle]] makes the distinction between [[Potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Cohen|first=S. Marc|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by [[Four causes|causes]], making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.

=== Aquinas ===
The major distinction [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] makes is that of [[essence]] and [[existence]]. It is a distinction already in [[Avicenna]], but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/#H2|title=Aquinas: Metaphysics {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kant ===
In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colin|first=Marshall,|title=Kant’s One Self and the Appearance/Thing-in-itself Distinction|url=https://www.academia.edu/2573493/Kants_one_self_and_the_appearance_thing-in-itself_distinction|journal=Kant-Studien|language=en|volume=104|issn=0022-8877}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7500">A '''first principle''' is a basic, foundational, self-evident [[proposition]] or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In [[philosophy]], first principles are taught by [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as [[postulate]]s by [[Kantian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Bourke, ''Ethics'', (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1966), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], first principles are referred to as [[axiom]]s or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting.

==In formal logic==
In a formal [[logical system]], that is, a set of [[proposition]]s that are consistent with one another, it is [[Logical possibility|possible]] that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the [[syllogism]], ''"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal"'' the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an [[Axiom#Mathematical logic#Logical axioms|axiom]] that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of [[Euclid's Elements]]; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and common notions: all three types constitute first principles.

==Philosophy in general==
In philosophy "first principles" are also commonly referred to as ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' terms and arguments, which are contrasted to ''[[a posteriori]]'' terms, reasoning or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as [[epistemology]], but are an important factor in any [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation.  

In philosophy "first principles" are often somewhat synonymous with ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'', datum and [[axiomatic reasoning]].

==Aristotle's contribution==
[[Terence Irwin]] writes:
{{quote|When Aristotle explains in general terms what he tries to do in his philosophical works, he says he is looking for "first principles" (or "origins"; archai):
:In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements. It is clear, then, that in the science of nature as elsewhere, we should try first to determine questions about the first principles. The naturally proper direction of our road is from things better known and clearer to us, to things that are clearer and better known by nature; for the things known to us are not the same as the things known unconditionally (haplôs). Hence it is necessary for us to progress, following this procedure, from the things that are less clear by nature, but clearer to us, towards things that are clearer and better known by nature. (Phys. 184a10–21)
The connection between knowledge and first principles is not axiomatic as expressed in Aristotle's account of a first principle (in one sense) as "the first basis from which a thing is known" (Met. 1013a14–15). The search for first principles is not peculiar to philosophy; philosophy shares this aim with biological, meteorological, and historical inquiries, among others. But Aristotle's references to first principles in this opening passage of the Physics and at the start of other philosophical inquiries imply that it is a primary task of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Descartes==
Profoundly influenced by [[Euclid]], [[Descartes]] was a [[rationalist]] who invented the [[foundationalist]] system of philosophy. He used the ''method of doubt'', now called [[Cartesian doubt]], to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt, until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' truths. His most famous proposition is "Je pense, donc je suis." (''I think, therefore I am'', or ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]'')

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644):
{{quote|I should have desired, in the first place, to explain in it what philosophy is, by commencing with the most common matters, as, for example, that the word philosophy signifies the study of wisdom, and that by wisdom is to be understood not merely prudence in the management of affairs, but a perfect knowledge of all that man can know, as well for the conduct of his life as for the preservation of his health and the discovery of all the arts, and that knowledge to subserve these ends must necessarily be deduced from first causes; so that in order to study the acquisition of it (which is properly called [284] philosophizing), we must commence with the investigation of those first causes which are called Principles. Now these principles must possess two conditions: in the first place, they must be so clear and evident that the human mind, when it attentively considers them, cannot doubt of their truth; in the second place, the knowledge of other things must be so dependent on them as that though the principles themselves may indeed be known apart from what depends on them, the latter cannot nevertheless be known apart from the former. It will accordingly be necessary thereafter to endeavor so to deduce from those principles the knowledge of the things that depend on them, as that there may be nothing in the whole series of deductions which is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;VOL I, Principles, Preface to the French edition. Author’s letter to the translator of the book which may here serve as a preface, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==In physics==
In [[physics]], a calculation is said to be ''from first principles'', or ''[[ab initio]]'', if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical [[Physical model|model]] and [[Curve fitting|fitting]] parameters.

For example, calculation of [[electronic structure]] using [[Schrödinger's equation]] within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' approach]].

== Generalization, corollaries, usage ==
There are many [[corollary|corollaries]] to Godwin's law, some considered more [[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] (by being adopted by Godwin himself)&lt;ref name="Godwin95canonical version" /&gt; than others.&lt;ref name="GL FAQ" /&gt; For example, there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that, when a Hitler comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever made the comparison loses whatever [[debate]] is in progress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6408927/Internet-rules-and-laws-the-top-10-from-Godwin-to-Poe.html "Internet rules and laws: the top 10, from Godwin to Poe"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (London), October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=North Korea|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07tMQs-5SD8|access-date=7 November 2017|series=Last Week Tonight|network=HBO|date=13 August 2017|transcript="There honestly aren't that many instances in modern American politics where you can honestly think: that guy really should have mentioned the nazis, but this is emphatically one of them. It's like the reversed Godwin's law - if you fail to mention Nazism, you lose the argument."|language=English|last=Oliver|first=John (host)}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law itself can be abused as a distraction, diversion or even as [[censorship]], fallaciously miscasting an opponent's argument as [[hyperbole]] when the comparisons made by the argument are actually appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;David Weigel, [http://www.reason.com/news/show/32944.html "Hands Off Hitler! It's time to repeal Godwin's Law"] ''Reason'' magazine, July 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2012/05/adolf-hitler-and-double-standards.html Mitt Hitler and Double Standards: Godwin's Law Applies to Thee, But Not to Me], [[No Pasarán]], May 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticisms of the "law" (or "at least the distorted version which purports to prohibit all comparisons to German crimes") have been made by the American  lawyer, journalist, and author [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Glenn Greenwald|Greenwald, Glenn]] (July 1, 2010) [http://www.salon.com/2010/07/01/godwin/ The odiousness of the distorted Godwin's Law], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin's law does not claim to articulate a [[fallacy]]; it is instead framed as a memetic tool to reduce the incidence of inappropriate hyperbolic comparisons. "Although deliberately framed as if it were a law of nature or of [[mathematics]]," Godwin wrote, "its purpose has always been [[Rhetorics|rhetorical]] and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]]: I wanted folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler to think a bit harder about [[the Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/post/i_seem_be_verb_18_years_godwins_law|title=I Seem To Be A Verb: 18 Years of Godwin's Law|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=Jewcy.com|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mike Godwin June08 B recrop 5 to 7.jpg|thumb|Mike Godwin in 2008]]

Godwin has stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in [[memetics]].&lt;ref name="Godwin94" /&gt;

In 2012, "Godwin's law" became an entry in the third edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/340583?redirectedFrom=Godwin%27s+law#eid|title=Godwin's law|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Godwin commented on the Nazi and fascist comparisons being made by several articles about [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], saying: "If you're thoughtful about it and show some real awareness of history, go ahead and refer to Hitler when you talk about Trump, or any other politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godwin|first1=Mike|title=Sure, call Trump a Nazi.

In October 2018, Godwin made a similar statement when someone asked him, via [[Twitter]], if it would be OK to call Brazilian presidential candidate [[Jair Bolsonaro]] a "nazi", answering a direct question ("So, just to be clear, is it OK to call Bolsonaro a nazi?") with the [[Portuguese language|portuguese]] word "Sim!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/criador-da-lei-de-godwin-diz-que-e-ok-chamar-bolsonaro-de-nazista.shtml|title=Criador da Lei de Godwin diz que é ok chamar Bolsonaro de nazista|date=2018-10-17|work=Folha de S.Paulo|access-date=2018-11-11|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/sfmnemonic/status/1052371927552135168|title=Mike Godwin #EleNão on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (meaning "yes" in English).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12189">The '''identity of indiscernibles''' is an [[ontology|ontological]] principle that states that there cannot be separate [[object (philosophy)|object]]s or [[entity|entities]] that have all their [[property (philosophy)|properties]] in common. That is, entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if every [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. It states that no two distinct things (such as [[snowflake]]s) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. A related principle is the indiscernibility of identicals, discussed below.

A form of the principle is attributed to the German philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].  It is one of his two great metaphysical principles, the other being the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Both are famously used in his arguments with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]]. Because of its association with Leibniz, the principle is sometimes known as '''Leibniz's law'''. 

Some philosophers have decided, however, that it is important to exclude certain predicates (or purported predicates) from the principle in order to avoid either triviality or contradiction. An example (detailed below) is the predicate that denotes whether an object is equal to ''x'' (often considered a valid predicate). As a consequence, there are a few different versions of the principle in the philosophical literature, of varying logical strength—and some of them are termed "the strong principle" or "the weak principle" by particular authors, in order to distinguish between them.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Forrest | first=Peter | title=The Identity of Indiscernibles | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=Fall 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/identity-indiscernible/ |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] thought that the failure of [[substitutivity]] in intensional contexts (e.g., "Sally believes that ''p''" or "It is necessarily the case that ''q''") shows that [[modal logic]] is an impossible project.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Notes on Existence and Necessity." ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;40, No.&amp;nbsp;5 (March 4, 1943), pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] holds that this failure may be the result of the use of the [[disquotational principle]] implicit in these proofs, and not a failure of substitutivity as such.&lt;ref name="belief"&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief". First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A.&amp;nbsp;Margalit. Dordrecht: D.&amp;nbsp;Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of indiscernibles has been used to motivate notions of [[Quantum contextuality|noncontextuality]] within quantum mechanics.

Associated with this principle is also the question as to whether it is a [[logical]] principle, or merely an [[empirical]] principle.

==Identity and indiscernibility==
There are two principles here that must be distinguished (equivalent versions of each are given in the language of the predicate calculus).&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Note that these are all [[Second-order logic|second-order]] expressions. Neither of these principles can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] (are [[nonfirstorderizability|nonfirstorderizable]]).

Principle 1 doesn't entail [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] of = (or any other relation ''R'' substituted for it), but both properties together entail [[Symmetric relation|symmetry]] and [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] (see proof box). Therefore, Principle 1 and reflexivity is sometimes used as a (second-order) [[Axiomatic system|axiomatization]] for the equality relation.

Principle 1 is taken to be a [[logical truth]] and (for the most part) uncontroversial.&lt;ref name=Forrest2008 /&gt; Principle&amp;nbsp;2, on the other hand, is controversial; [[Max Black]] famously argued against it.

The above formulations are not satisfactory, however: the second principle should be read as having an implicit side-condition excluding any predicates that are equivalent (in some sense) to any of the following:{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
#"is identical to ''x''"
#"is identical to ''y''"
#"is not identical to ''x''"
#"is not identical to ''y''"
If all such predicates are included, then the second principle as formulated above can be trivially and uncontroversially shown to be a [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]]: if ''x'' is non-identical to ''y'', then there will always be a putative "property" that distinguishes them, namely "being identical to ''x''".

On the other hand, it is incorrect to exclude all predicates that are [[materially equivalent]] (i.e., [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]]ly equivalent) to one or more of the four given above. If this is done, the principle says that in a universe consisting of two non-identical objects, because all distinguishing predicates are materially equivalent to at least one of the four given above (in fact, they are each materially equivalent to two of them), the two non-identical objects are identical—which is a contradiction.

==Critique==
===Symmetric universe===
[[Max Black]] has argued against the identity of indiscernibles by counterexample. Notice that to show that the identity of indiscernibles is false, it is sufficient that one provides a [[Model theory|model]] in which there are two distinct (numerically nonidentical) things that have all the same properties. He claimed that in a symmetric universe wherein only two symmetrical spheres exist, the two spheres are two distinct objects even though they have all their properties in common.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics: An Anthology''. eds. J. Kim and E. Sosa, Blackwell Publishing, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's argument appears significant because it shows that even relational properties (properties specifying distances between objects in space-time) fail to distinguish two identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Per his argument, two objects are, and will remain, equidistant from the universe's plane of symmetry and each other. Even bringing in an external observer to label the two spheres distinctly does not solve the problem, because it violates the symmetry of the universe.

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
As stated above, the principle of indiscernibility of identicals—that if two objects are in fact one and the same, they have all the same properties—is mostly uncontroversial. However, one famous application of the indiscernibility of identicals was by [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous ''[[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'' argument), but that he ''could'' doubt the existence of his body.

This argument is criticized by some modern philosophers on the grounds that it allegedly derives a conclusion about what is true from a premise about what people know.  What people know or believe about an entity, they argue, is not really a characteristic of that entity. A response may be that the argument in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' is that the inability of Descartes to doubt the existence of his mind is part of his mind's [[essence]]. One may then argue that identical things should have identical essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=8sN_sdfBpGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Between Two Worlds: A Reading of Descartes's Meditations | first=John Peter | last=Carriero | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous counterexamples are given to debunk Descartes' reasoning via ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', such as the following argument based on a [[secret identity]]:

#Entities ''x'' and ''y'' are identical if and only if any predicate possessed by ''x'' is also possessed by ''y'' and vice versa.
#Clark Kent is Superman's secret identity; that is, they're the same person (identical) but people don't know this fact.
#[[Lois Lane]] thinks that [[Clark Kent]] cannot fly.
#Lois Lane thinks that [[Superman]] can fly.
#Therefore Superman has a property that Clark Kent does not have, namely that Lois Lane thinks that he can fly.
#Therefore, Superman is not identical to Clark Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | title=Alter Egos and Their Names | first=David | last=Pitt | journal=The Journal of Philosophy | volume=98 | issue=10 | date=October 2001 | pages=531–552, 550 | doi=10.2307/3649468 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508170350/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/dpitt/Egos.pdf | archivedate=2006-05-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Since in proposition&amp;nbsp;6 we come to a contradiction with proposition&amp;nbsp;2, we conclude that at least one of the premises is wrong. Either:
#* Leibniz's law is wrong; or
#* A person's knowledge about ''x'' is not a predicate of ''x''; or
#* The application of Leibniz's law is erroneous; the law is only applicable in cases of monadic, not polyadic, properties; or
#* What people think about are not the actual objects themselves; or
#* A person is capable of holding conflicting beliefs.
:::Any of which will undermine Descartes' argument.&lt;ref name="belief" /&gt;

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

Another way of phrasing Landauer's principle is that if an observer loses information about a [[physical system]], the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.

A so-called logically-reversible computation, in which no information is erased, may in principle be carried out without releasing any heat.  This has led to considerable interest in the study of [[reversible computing]]. Indeed, without reversible computing, increases in the number of computations-per-joule-of-energy-dissipated must come to a halt by about 2050: because the limit implied by Landauer's principle will be reached by then, according to [[Koomey's law]]. 

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature, or 293.15&amp;nbsp;K), the Landauer limit represents an energy of approximately 0.0172&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]], or 2.75&amp;nbsp;[[zeptojoule|zJ]]. Theoretically, room{{nbhyph}}temperature computer memory operating at the Landauer limit could be changed at a rate of one billion bits per second with energy being converted to heat in the memory media at the rate of only 2.85 trillionths of a watt (that is, at a rate of only 2.85 pJ/s).  Modern computers use millions of times as much energy per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/Landauer |title=Tikalon Blog by Dev Gualtieri |publisher=Tikalon.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomweb.com/nanomagnet-memories-approach-low-power-limit/ |title=Nanomagnet memories approach low-power limit &amp;#124; bloomfield knoble |publisher=Bloomweb.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/landauer-limit-demonstrated |title=Landauer Limit Demonstrated - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Rolf Landauer]] first proposed the principle in 1961 while working at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="landauer"&gt;{{Citation |author=Rolf Landauer |url=http://worrydream.com/refs/Landauer%20-%20Irreversibility%20and%20Heat%20Generation%20in%20the%20Computing%20Process.pdf |title=Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process |journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=183–191 |year=1961 |accessdate=2015-02-18 |doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He rigorously justified and stated important limits to an earlier conjecture by [[John von Neumann]]. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as being simply the Landauer bound or Landauer limit.

In 2011, the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost&lt;ref name="vaccaro"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Joan Vaccaro |author2=Stephen Barnett |title=Information Erasure Without an Energy Cost |journal=Proc. R. Soc. A |date=June 8, 2011 |volume=467 |issue=2130 |pages=1770–1778 |doi=10.1098/rspa.2010.0577 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/early/2011/01/07/rspa.2010.0577.full.pdf |arxiv=1004.5330|bibcode = 2011RSPSA.467.1770V }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, the cost can be taken in another [[Conservation law (physics)|conserved quantity]], such as  [[angular momentum]].

In a 2012 article published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], a team of physicists from the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]], [[University of Augsburg]] and the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] described that for the first time they have measured the tiny amount of heat released when an individual bit of data is erased.&lt;ref name="berut"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antoine Bérut |author2=Artak Arakelyan |author3=Artyom Petrosyan |author4=Sergio Ciliberto |author5=Raoul Dillenschneider |author6=Eric Lutz |doi=10.1038/nature10872 |title=Experimental verification of Landauer’s principle linking information and thermodynamics |journal=Nature |volume=483 |issue=7388 |pages=187–190 |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/raoul.pdf|bibcode = 2012Natur.483..187B |pmid=22398556|arxiv=1503.06537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, physical experiments tested Landauer's principle and confirmed its predictions.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Yonggun Jun |author2=Momčilo Gavrilov |author3=John Bechhoefer |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.190601 |title=High-Precision Test of Landauer's Principle in a Feedback Trap |journal=[[Phys.

In 2016, researchers used a laser probe to measure the amount of energy dissipation that resulted when a nanomagnetic bit flipped from off to on. Flipping the bit required 15 millielectron volts (3 [[zeptojoule]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hong|first = Jeongmin|last2 = Lambson|first2 = Brian|last3 = Dhuey|first3 = Scott|last4 = Bokor|first4 = Jeffrey|date = 2016-03-01|title = Experimental test of Landauer’s principle in single-bit operations on nanomagnetic memory bits|url = http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501492|journal = Science Advances|language = en|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = e1501492|doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1501492|issn = 2375-2548|pmc = 4795654|bibcode = 2016SciA....2E1492H|pmid=26998519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 article published in [[Nature Physics (journal)|''Nature Physics'']] features a Landauer erasure performed at cryogenic temperatures (T = 1K) on an array of high-spin (S = 10) quantum [[molecular magnets]]. The array is made to act as a spin register where each nanomagnet encodes a single bit of information.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment has laid the foundations for the extension of the validity of the Landauer principle to the quantum realm. Owing to the fast dynamics and low "inertia" of the single spins used in the experiment, the researchers also showed how an erasure operation can be carried out at the lowest possible thermodynamic cost — that imposed by the Landauer principle — and at a high speed.&lt;ref name="Gaudenzi"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Rocco Gaudenzi |author2=Enrique Burzuri |author3=Satoru Maegawa |author4=Herre van der Zant |author5=Fernando Luis |doi=10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7 |title=Quantum Landauer erasure with a molecular nanomagnet |journal= Nature Physics |volume=14 |pages= 565–568 |date=19 March 2018 |url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-018-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

==Rationale==
Landauer's principle can be understood to be a simple [[logical consequence]] of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]—which states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] cannot decrease—together with the definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]]. For, if the number of possible logical states of a computation were to decrease as the computation proceeded forward (logical irreversibility), this would constitute a forbidden decrease of entropy, unless the number of possible physical states corresponding to each logical state were to simultaneously increase by at least a compensating amount, so that the total number of possible physical states was no smaller than it was originally (i.e. total entropy has not decreased).

Yet, an increase in the number of physical states corresponding to each logical state means that, for an observer who is keeping track of the logical state of the system but not the physical state (for example an "observer" consisting of the computer itself), the number of possible physical states has increased; in other words, entropy has increased from the point of view of this observer.

The maximum entropy of a bounded physical system is finite. (If the [[holographic principle]] is correct, then physical systems with finite [[surface area]] have a finite maximum entropy; but regardless of the truth of the holographic principle, [[quantum field theory]] dictates that the entropy of systems with finite radius and energy is finite due to the [[Bekenstein bound]].) To avoid reaching this maximum over the course of an extended computation, entropy must eventually be expelled to an outside environment.

==Equation==
Landauer's principle asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the ''Landauer limit'':

:{{math|''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2,}}
where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (approximately 1.38×10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; J/K), ''T'' is the temperature of the heat sink in [[kelvin]]s, and ln&amp;#8239;2 is the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 (approximately 0.69315).

For an environment at temperature ''T'', energy ''E'' = ''ST'' must be emitted into that environment if the amount of added entropy is ''S''. For a computational operation in which 1 [[bit]] of logical information is lost, the amount of entropy generated is at least ''k'' ln&amp;#8239;2, and so, the energy that must eventually be emitted to the environment is ''E'' ≥ ''kT'' ln&amp;#8239;2.

==Challenges==
The principle is widely accepted as [[physical law]], but in recent years it has been challenged for using [[circular reasoning]] and faulty assumptions, notably in Earman and Norton (1998), and subsequently in Shenker (2000)&lt;ref name="shenker"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000115/ Logic and Entropy] Critique by Orly Shenker (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and Norton (2004,&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001729/ Eaters of the Lotus] Critique by John Norton (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="norton2"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Waiting_SHPMP.pdf Waiting for Landauer] Response by Norton (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;), and defended by Bennett (2003)&lt;ref name="bennett" /&gt; and Ladyman et al.

In [[forensic science]], '''Locard's exchange principle'''  holds that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it, and that both can be used as [[forensic evidence]]. Dr. [[Edmond Locard]] (13 December 1877 – 4 May 1966) was a pioneer in forensic science who became known as the [[Sherlock Holmes]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;http://aboutforensics.co.uk/edmond-locard/&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the basic principle of forensic science as: "Every contact leaves a trace". Paul L. Kirk&lt;ref&gt;''Crime investigation: physical evidence and the police laboratory''. Interscience Publishers, Inc.: New York, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; expressed the principle as follows:

:"Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value."

Fragmentary or [[trace evidence]] is any type of material left at (or taken from) a crime scene, or the result of contact between two surfaces, such as shoes and the floor covering or soil, or fibers from where someone sat on an upholstered chair.

When a crime is committed, fragmentary (or trace) evidence needs to be collected from the scene. A team of specialized police technicians goes to the scene of the crime and seals it off. They record video and take photographs of the crime scene, victim/s (if there are any) and items of evidence. If necessary, they undertake ballistics examinations. They check for foot, shoe, and tire mark impressions, plus hair as well as examine any vehicles and check for fingerprints - whole or partial.

==Famous cases==

The case studies below show how prevalent Locard's Exchange Principle is in each and every crime. The examples using Locard's Principle show not only how the transfer of trace evidence can tell the tale of what happened, but also how much care is required when collecting and evaluating trace evidence.

===The Weimar children murders===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Karola and Melanie Weimar, aged 5 and 7, lived with their parents, Reinhard and Monika, in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, Gerhard. [http://strate.net/en/publications/weimar_murder_case.html “The Weimar murder case – strength and risk of material evidence,"] Hamburg, 05/01/2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Monika Böttcher|Monika Böttcher.]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were reported missing on 4 August 1986. Their bodies were found on 7 August. They had been murdered.

Monika first said the children had breakfast, then went to a [[playground]]. Three weeks later she said they were already dead when she returned home the previous night: Reinhard was sitting on the edge of Karola's bed, weeping and confused; he then disposed of the bodies.

Both parents were suspected, but Monika was having an [[affair]], and was seen where Melanie's body was later found. She was convicted, but after serving her sentence, was released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrichsen, Gisela. [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/ende-eines-justizdramas-zweifache-kindsmoerderin-monika-boettcher-ist-frei-a-432435.html “End of a judicial drama: twice infanticide Monika Böttcher is free,"] Spiegel online Panorama, August 18, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators determined what clothes Monika was wearing on 3 and 4 August, but not Reinhard's clothes, so only [[fibers]] from her clothing were identified on the children's bodies, yet they were also constantly in contact with him.

The [[bedding]] contained 14 fibers from Karola's [[T-shirt]]. Frictionless tests, simulating a dead child, matched that figure better than the friction tests, simulating a live child, so Karola could have lain lifelessly in bed wearing her T-shirt, as stated by her mother.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

35 fibers from Monika's [[blouse]] were found on the back of Melanie's T-shirt, but only one on her [[bed sheet]]. In tests, between 6 and 10 fibers remained on the sheet. These higher numbers were thought{{by whom|date=March 2016}} to disprove Monika's claim that she gave her child a goodbye [[hug]] the previous day. However, there are several likely explanations. For example, the bedding was put in one bag, so fibers from the sheet could have been transferred to the cover and [[pillow]]. Only the central area of the top of the sheet was taped: it might have originally contained more than one blouse fiber, the others could have been transferred to the back or sides while in the bag.

The blouse fibers on Melanie's clothing were distributed evenly, not the clusters expected from carrying the body.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

265 fibers from the family car’s rear seat covers were found on Melanie's [[panties]] and the inside of her trousers, but only a small number of fibers from the front seats was found on the children. This helped disprove the theory that they were killed on the front seats.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Melanie's clothes and hair were covered in 375 clinging fruits of [[Galium aparine|goosegrass]]. As some of these itchy things were on the inside of her trousers and on her panties, the trousers must have been put on her after death.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

No [[sand]] was found on the bodies or clothing (including socks and [[sandals]]) of either child, making the morning playground story unlikely.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== The Westerfield-van Dam case ===

[[David Westerfield|Danielle van Dam]], aged 7, lived with her parents and brothers in [[San Diego]], California. She was reported missing on 2 February 2002; her body was discovered on 27 February. Neighbor [[David Westerfield]] was almost immediately suspected, as he had gone [[camping]] in his [[RV]], and he was convicted of her [[kidnapping]] and murder.

Hairs consistent with the van Dams’ dog were found in his RV, also carpet fibers consistent with Danielle's [[bedroom]] carpet. Danielle's nightly [[ritual]] was to [[wrestle]] with the dog after getting into her [[pajamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prosecution]] argued that those hairs and fibers got onto her pajamas through that contact, and were then carried on the pajamas to first Westerfield's house and then to his RV, when he kidnapped her from her bed. The alternative scenario is that they got onto her daytime clothes, and those of her mother and younger brother, and were carried to his house when they visited him earlier that week selling [[cookies]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex.

[http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, his RV was often parked, sometimes unlocked, in the neighborhood streets, so Danielle could have sneaked inside, leaving behind that evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No trace of Westerfield was found in the van Dam house.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020806-9999-final.html “Physical evidence shows Westerfield committed 'evil, evil crime,' prosecutor says,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 6 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

14 hairs consistent with Danielle's were found in his environment. All but one were compared on only [[mitochondrial DNA]], so they might have come from her mother or a sibling.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/27/export12906.txt “DNA expert: Hair was Danielle's,"] North County Times, 26 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most (21) of the hairs were in a dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] ball in his [[waste container|trash can]], so they might have got in his laundry before the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 5 carpet fibers in his RV, but none in his house, suggesting those were deposited by someone going directly from her house to his RV, or they may have come from another house in that development.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020625-9999_1m25hair.html “Criminalist links hairs, carpet fibers to Danielle: Evidence found in defendant's home,”] San Diego Union-Tribune, 25 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

No Danielle pajama or bedding fibers were reported in his environment. There was no trace evidence in his [[SUV]] (which casts doubt on the belief that she was transported from his house to his RV in his SUV).&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Kimberly. [http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2002/06/25/export12739.txt “Hair in Westerfield home similar to Danielle's,"] North County Times, 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He vacuumed his RV after the kidnapping, but no trace evidence was in the [[vacuum cleaner]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Harriet. [http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html “Experts: Girl's prints found in Westerfield's RV,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204211022/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/061902-pm_ctv.html |date=4 February 2009 }} Court TV, 20 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

One orange fiber with her body was consistent with about 200 in his house and 20 in his SUV (none in his RV), while 21 blue fibers with her body were consistent with 10 in his house and 46 in his RV (none in his SUV). Contrary to media reports, only a few items from her house were tested so that can’t be excluded as the source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html “Witnesses for the Prosecution,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227001224/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/witnesses-sta.html |date=27 December 2008 }} Court TV, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the clothes of Danielle and her family during the cookie sale were not determined and eliminated. There were apparently two different types of the orange fibers, dull and very bright (so the number which matched might have been much less than 200).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html “A Single Strand,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406142035/http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/photogallery/evidence28.html |date=6 April 2009 }} Court TV, photogallery, evidence28, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; There were red fibers with her [[fingernails]], and many other fibers with her body, which could not be matched to his environment.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Steve, and Jeff Dillon. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020807-9999-final.html “Defense rests; each side puts its spin on evidence,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 7 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The only non-Danielle hair found with her body wasn’t his, nor was any desert sand reported with the body, and no soil or vegetation from the dump site was reported on his shoes, laundry, shovel or RV.

To explain why so much expected evidence was missing, the prosecution argued that he went on a cleaning frenzy, and tossed out evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Alex. [http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/danielle/20020809-9999_1n9dusek.html “Jury begins deliberations: Prosecutor says victim has pointed to her killer,"] San Diego Union-Tribune, 9 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21697">In [[theoretical physics]], particularly in [[discussions]] of [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|gravitation theories]],  '''Mach's principle''' (or '''Mach's conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Von Bayer, ''The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science'', Courier Dover Publications (2001), {{ISBN|0-486-41707-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VhJr9Qx8ohsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=mach's+conjecture&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Scny_DNMuM&amp;sig=Wm2-2sWSkBltjREyyxNkh1g-wFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach#Philosophy of science|Ernst Mach]]. The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1268">==Introduction==
The mental model theory of reasoning was developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991). It has been applied to the main domains of deductive inference including relational inferences such as spatial and temporal deductions; propositional inferences, such as conditional, disjunctive and negation deductions; quantified inferences such as syllogisms; and meta-deductive inferences.

Ongoing research on [[mental models and reasoning]] has led the theory to be extended to account for probabilistic inference (e.g., Johnson-Laird, 2006) and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20341">[[Daniel Dennett]]'s '''multiple drafts model of consciousness''' is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory of [[consciousness]] based upon [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which views the [[mind]] in terms of [[information processing]]. The theory is described in depth in his book, ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'', published in 1991. As the title states, the book proposes a high-level explanation of consciousness which is consistent with support for the possibility of [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI.]]

Dennett describes the theory as ''first-person [[operationalism]]''. As he states it:
{{quote|The Multiple Drafts model makes [the procedure of] "writing it down" in memory criterial for consciousness: that is ''what it is'' for the "given" to be "taken" ... There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&lt;ref name="dennett1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel, C. |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The thesis of multiple drafts==
Dennett's thesis is that our modern understanding of consciousness is unduly influenced by the ideas of [[René Descartes]]. To show why, he starts with a description of the [[color phi phenomenon|phi illusion]]. In this experiment, two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour ''before'' the second light is observed.

Dennett claims that conventional explanations of the colour change boil down to either ''Orwellian'' or ''Stalinesque'' hypotheses, which he says are the result of Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trial]]s, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.
{{quote|[W]e can suppose, both theorists have ''exactly'' the same theory of what happens in your brain; they agree about just where and when in the brain the mistaken content enters the causal pathways; they just disagree about whether that location is to be deemed pre-experiential or post-experiential. ... [T]hey even agree about how it ought to "feel" to subjects: Subjects should be unable to tell the difference between misbegotten experiences and immediately misremembered experiences. [p. 125, original emphasis.]}}

Dennett argues that there is no principled basis for picking one of these theories over the other, because they share a common error in supposing that there is a special time and place where unconscious processing becomes consciously experienced, entering into what Dennett calls the "[[Cartesian theatre]]". Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. Dennett states that, "[t]here does not exist ... a process such as 'recruitment of consciousness' (into what?), nor any place where the 'vehicle's arrival' is recognized (by whom?)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121095257/http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/multdrft.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 November 2005|title=Multiple Drafts...|date=21 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Cartesian materialism]] is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of "presentation" in experience because ''what happens there'' is what you are conscious of. ... Many theorists would insist that they have explicitly rejected such an obviously bad idea. But ... the persuasive imagery of the Cartesian Theater keeps coming back to haunt us—laypeople and scientists alike—even after its ghostly dualism has been denounced and exorcized. [p. 107, original emphasis.]}}

With no theatre, there is no screen, hence no reason to re-present data after it has already been analysed. Dennett says that, "the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!"

According to the model, there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times, so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations, constituting the equivalent of multiple drafts of a story. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished, it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour; it does not have to wait to be presented at the theatre.

Like a number of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands conscious experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.

Different parts of the neural processing assert more or less control at different times. For something to reach consciousness is akin to becoming famous, in that it must leave behind consequences by which it is remembered. To put it another way, consciousness is the property of having enough influence to affect what the mouth will say and the hands will do. Which inputs are "edited" into our drafts is not an exogenous act of supervision, but part of the self-organizing functioning of the network, and at the same level as the circuitry that conveys information bottom-up.

The conscious self is taken to exist as an abstraction visible at the level of the [[intentional stance]], akin to a body of mass having a "centre of gravity". Analogously, Dennett refers to the self as the "centre of narrative gravity", a story we tell ourselves about our experiences. Consciousness exists, but not independently of behaviour and behavioural disposition, which can be studied through [[heterophenomenology]].

The origin of this operationalist approach can be found in Dennett's immediately preceding work. Dennett (1988) explains consciousness in terms of ''access consciousness'' alone, denying the independent existence of what [[Ned Block]] has labeled ''phenomenal consciousness''.&lt;ref name="block1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Block, N. |title=On a confusion about a function of consciousness |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=18 |pages=227–287 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00038188}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties". Having related all consciousness to properties, he concludes that they cannot be meaningfully distinguished from our judgements about them. He writes: 
{{quote|The [[infallibilist]] line on [[qualia]] treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infallibility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F. We can then treat such judgings as constitutive acts, in effect, bringing the quale into existence by the same sort of license as novelists have to determine the hair color of their characters by fiat. We do not ask how Dostoevski knows that Raskolnikov's hair is light brown.&lt;ref name="dennett2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel C. |title=Quining Qualia |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, once we've explained a perception fully in terms of how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such thing as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a [[quale]]). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.
{{quote|So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors—private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority—not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing—but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re-identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all.&lt;ref name="dennett2"/&gt;}}

The key to the multiple drafts model is that, after removing qualia, explaining consciousness boils down to explaining the behaviour we recognise as conscious. Consciousness is as consciousness does.

==Critical responses==
Some of the criticism of Dennett's theory is due to the perceived tone of his presentation. As one grudging supporter admits, "there is much in this book that is disputable. And Dennett is at times aggravatingly smug and confident about the merits of his arguments ... All in all Dennett's book is annoying, frustrating, insightful, provocative and above all annoying" (Korb 1993).

Bogen (1992) points out that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That being the case, if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be ''two'' Cartesian theatres, so arguments against only one are flawed.&lt;ref name="bogen"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bogen, J.E. |title=Descartes' fundamental mistake: Introspective singularity |year=1992 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |issue=15 |pages=184–247 | doi = 10.1017/s0140525x00033914 |volume=17}} Commentary on Daniel C. Dennett and Marcel Kinsbourne (1992) ''Time and the observer: The where and when of consciousness in the brain.''&lt;/ref&gt; Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the [[cutaneous rabbit illusion]] demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.&lt;ref name="vel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Velmans, M. |title=Is Consciousness Integrated? |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=15 |pages=229–230 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00068473}}(commentary on Dennett &amp; Kinsbourne "Time and the observer", BBS, 1992, 15(2): 183–201) Copyright Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been claimed that the argument in the multiple drafts model does not support its conclusion.&lt;ref name="bring"&gt;{{cite web |author=Bringsjord, S. |url=http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/bringsjord96explaining.html |title=Explaining Phi Without Dennett's Exotica: Good Ol' Computation Suffices |&lt;!-- accessdate=1996 --&gt;}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Straw man"===
Much of the criticism asserts that Dennett's theory attacks the wrong target, failing to explain what it claims to. Chalmers (1996) maintains that Dennett has produced no more than a theory of how subjects report events.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chalmers, David |title=The Conscious Mind |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some even parody the title of the book as "Consciousness Explained Away", accusing him of [[greedy reductionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3005001 BBC.co.uk] – Some Modern Theories of Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; Another line of criticism disputes the accuracy of Dennett's characterisations of existing theories:
{{quote|The now standard response to Dennett's project is that he has picked a fight with a [[straw man]]. Cartesian materialism, it is alleged, is an impossibly naive account of phenomenal consciousness held by no one currently working in cognitive science or the philosophy of mind. Consequently, whatever the effectiveness of Dennett's demolition job, it is fundamentally misdirected (see, e.g., Block, 1993, 1995; Shoemaker, 1993; and Tye, 1993).&lt;ref name="bando"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Brien, G.  |author2=Opie, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A defense of Cartesian Materialism |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |volume=59 |pages= 939–63 |doi=10.2307/2653563}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Unoriginality===
Multiple drafts is also attacked for making a claim to novelty. It may be the case, however, that such attacks mistake which features Dennett is claiming as novel. Korb states that, "I believe that the central thesis will be relatively uncontentious for most cognitive scientists, but that its use as a cleaning solvent for messy puzzles will be viewed less happily in most quarters." (Korb 1993) In this way, Dennett uses uncontroversial ideas towards more controversial ends, leaving him open to claims of unoriginality when uncontroversial parts are focused upon.

Even the notion of consciousness as drafts is not unique to Dennett. According to Hankins, Dieter Teichert suggests that [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s theories agree with Dennett's on the notion that "the self is basically a narrative entity, and that any attempt to give it a free-floating independent status is misguided." [Hankins] Others see [[Derrida]]'s (1982) representationalism as consistent with the notion of a mind that has perceptually changing content without a definitive present instant.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;{{cite book |author=Derrida, J. |title=Margins of Philosophy |publisher=The University of Chicago Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To those who believe that consciousness entails something more than behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as [[eliminativism|eliminativist]], since it denies the existence of [[qualia]] and the possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate: whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.

===Information processing and consciousness===
The role of information processing in consciousness has been criticised by [[John Searle]] who, in his [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref name="searle"&gt;Searle, J. (1980) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070611104618/http://members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/MindsBrainsPrograms.html Minds, Brains and Programs]"&lt;/ref&gt; states that he cannot find anything that could be recognised as conscious experience in a system that relies solely on motions of things from place to place. Dennett sees this argument as misleading, arguing that consciousness is not to be found in a specific part of the system, but in the actions of the whole. In essence, he denies that consciousness requires something in addition to capacity for behaviour, saying that philosophers such as Searle, "just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system" (p.&amp;nbsp;439).

In [[mathematics]], a '''multiplication table''' (sometimes, less formally, a '''times table''') is a [[mathematical table]] used to define a [[multiplication]] [[binary operation|operation]] for an algebraic system.

The [[decimal]] multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=For the Learning of Mathematics|volume=1|issue=1|year=1980|title=The Multiplication Table: To Be Memorized or Mastered!|first=John|last=Trivett|pages=21–25|jstor= 40247697}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The multiplication table is sometimes attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]] (570–495&amp;nbsp;BC). It is also called the Table of Pythagoras in many languages (for example French, Italian and at one point even Russian), sometimes in English.&lt;ref&gt;for example in [https://books.google.com/books?id=TBBKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22table+of+pythagoras%22+-Montessori&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TaXIEXCAic&amp;sig=KiblQIMaPnnwRp-R0eW6CSEQUUk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IltFTezaDJH2sgatovGnDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22table%20of%20pythagoras%22%20-Montessori&amp;f=false ''An Elementary Treatise on Arithmetic'' by [[John Farrar (scientist)|John Farrar]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greco-Roman]] mathematician [[Nichomachus]] (60–120&amp;nbsp;AD), a follower of [[Neopythagoreanism]], included a multiplication table in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'', whereas the oldest surviving [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] multiplication table is on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD and currently housed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics''. New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{isbn|0-486-20429-4}}, pp. 58, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 493&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Victorius of Aquitaine]] wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in [[Roman numerals]]) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144."&lt;ref&gt;David W. Maher and John F. Makowski. "Literary evidence for Roman arithmetic with fractions". ''Classical Philology'', 96/4 (October 2001), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1820 book ''The Philosophy of Arithmetic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leslie |first=John |year=1820 |title=The Philosophy of Arithmetic; Exhibiting a Progressive View of the Theory and Practice of Calculation, with Tables for the Multiplication of Numbers as Far as One Thousand |publisher=Abernethy &amp; Walker |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] published a multiplication table up to 99 × 99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time.  Leslie also recommended that young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 25 × 25. The illustration below shows a table up to 12 × 12, which is a size commonly used in schools.

The traditional rote learning of multiplication was based on memorization of columns in the table, in a form like
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
&lt;poem&gt;
   1 × 10 = 10
   2 × 10 = 20
   3 × 10 = 30
   4 × 10 = 40
   5 × 10 = 50
   6 × 10 = 60
   7 × 10 = 70
   8 × 10 = 80
   9 × 10 = 90
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{div col end}}

This form of writing the multiplication table in columns with complete number sentences is still used in some countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} instead of the modern grid above.

==Patterns in the tables==
There is a pattern in the multiplication table that can help people to memorize the table more easily. It uses the figures below:
&lt;!--
      →                 →
    1 2 3             2   4
 ↑  4 5 6 ↓         ↑       ↓
    7 8 9             6   8
      ←                 ←

Figure 1 is used for multiples of 1, 3, 7, and 9. Figure 2 is used for the multiples of 2, 4, 6, and 8. These patterns can be used to memorize the multiples of any number from 0 to 10, except 5. As you would start on the number you are multiplying, when you multiply by 0, you stay on 0 (0 is external and so the arrows have no effect on 0, otherwise 0 is used as a link to create a perpetual cycle). The pattern also works with multiples of 10, by starting at 1 and simply adding 0, giving you 10, then just apply every number in the pattern to the "tens" unit as you would normally do as usual to the "ones" unit.

[[File:Multiplication_mnemonic_7.svg|thumb|120px|Using the mnemonic to recall multiples of 7]]
For example, to recall all the multiples of 7:

# Look at the 7 in the first picture and follow the arrow.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 4. So think of the next number after 7 that ends with 4, which is 14.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 1. So think of the next number after 14 that ends with 1, which is 21.
# After coming to the top of this column, start with the bottom of the next column, and travel in the same direction. The number is 8. So think of the next number after 21 that ends with 8, which is 28.
# Proceed in the same way until the last number, 3, corresponding to 63.
# Next, use the 0 at the bottom. It corresponds to 70.
# Then, start again with the 7.  This time it will correspond to 77.
# Continue like this.

==In abstract algebra==
Tables can also define binary operations on [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and other [[Abstract algebra|algebraic systems]]. In such contexts they can be called [[Cayley table]]s. Here are the addition and multiplication tables for the [[finite field]] '''Z&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

For every natural number ''n'', there are also addition and multiplication tables for the ring '''Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Chinese multiplication table==
{{Main|Chinese multiplication table}}
The Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one sentences with four or five Chinese characters per sentence, making it easy for children to learn by heart. A shorter version of the table consists of only forty-five sentences, as terms such as "nine eights beget seventy-two" are identical to "eight nines beget seventy-two" so there is no need to learn them twice.

==Standards-based mathematics reform in the US==
In 1989, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) developed new standards which were based on the belief that all students should learn higher-order thinking skills, and which recommended reduced emphasis on the teaching of traditional methods that relied on rote memorization, such as multiplication tables. Widely adopted texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space]] (widely known as [[Technical Education Research Centers|TERC]] after its producer, Technical Education Research Centers) omitted aids such as multiplication tables in early editions. NCTM made it clear in their 2006 [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Curriculum Focal Points|Focal Points]] that basic mathematics facts must be learned, though there is no consensus on whether rote memorization is the best method.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
In [[computer programming]], '''negative cache''' is a [[cache (computing)|cache]] that also stores "negative" responses, i.e. failures. This means that a program remembers the result indicating a failure even after the cause has been corrected. Usually negative cache is a design choice, but it can also be a [[software bug]].

==Examples==
Consider a [[web browser]] which attempts to load a page while the network is unavailable. The browser will receive an error code indicating the problem, and may display this error message to the user in place of the requested page. However, it is incorrect for the browser to place the error message in the page cache, as this would lead it to display the error again when the user tries to load the same page - even after the network is back up. The error message must not be cached under the page's [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]; until the browser is able to successfully load the page, whenever the user tries to load the page, the browser must make a new attempt.

A frustrating aspect of negative caches is that the user may put a great effort into [[troubleshooting]] the problem, and then after determining and removing the root cause, the error still does not vanish.

There are cases where failure-like states must be cached. For instance, [[Domain Name System|DNS]] requires that caching nameservers remember negative responses&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2308&lt;/ref&gt; as well as positive ones. If an authoritative nameserver returns a negative response, indicating that a name does not exist, this is cached. The negative response may be perceived as a failure at the application level; however, to the nameserver caching it, it is not a failure. The cache times for negative and positive caching may be tuned independently.

==Description==
A negative cache is normally only desired if failure is very expensive and the error condition arises automatically without user's action. It creates a situation where the user is unable to isolate the cause of the failure: despite fixing everything he/she can think of, the program still refuses to work. When a failure is cached, the program should provide a clear indication of what must be done to clear the cache, in addition to a description of the cause of the error. In such conditions a negative cache is an example of a design [[anti-pattern]].

Negative cache still may recover if the cached records expires.

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Negative campaigning''' or '''mudslinging''' is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the [[public relations|public image]] of the described.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of  winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.

The public image of an entity can be defined as [[reputation]], esteem, [[respect]], acceptance of the entity's appearance, [[values]] and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a [[social group]], possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged,  in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In [[polygamous]] societies [[monogamy]] is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in [[Western culture]] was considered immoral and was [[Homosexuality#Legality|criminally prosecuted]] until the [[sexual revolution]] of the second half of the 20 century.
Thus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the [[Old Testament]] and other traditional religious societies [[adultery]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.

In [[United States politics]], negative campaigning has been called "as [[American way of life|American]] as Mississippi mud" and "as American as apple pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The modern presidential campaign: Mudslinging, bombast, and the vitality of American politics|last = Scher|first = R. K.|publisher = M. E. Sharpe|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/russian5.pdf|title=The Rational Attacker in Russia? Negative Campaigning in Russian Presidential Elections|doi=10.1111/1468-2508.00117|jstor=2691664|author1=Lee Sigelman|author2=Eric Shiraev|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning.  Among the most effective is running [[advertisement]]s attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion.  There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent.  There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent.  Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent.  Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"&gt;Fridkin, K. L., &amp; Kenney, P. J. (2004). Do Negative Messages Work?: The Impact of Negativity on Citizens’ Evaluations of Candidates. American Politics Research, 32(570), 570–602. {{doi|10.1177/1532673X03260834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent.  The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative.  Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent.  Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"/&gt;

One of the most famous such ads was ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy Girl]]'' by the campaign of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that successfully portrayed Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] as threatening [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as [[lobbying|lobby groups]], to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] by allegedly independent bodies like [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

[[Push poll]]s are attacks disguised as [[Robo call#Political calls|telephone polls]]. They might ask a question like "How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

[[G. Gordon Liddy]] played a major role in developing these tactics during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the [[campaign of 1972]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[James Carville]], campaign manager of [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Lee Atwater]], best known for being an advisor to presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Political Legacy of Baaad Boy Atwater | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | date=September 20, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support [[mass communication]] of negative ideas. The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by [[tobacco companies]], or to discourage [[drunk driving]]. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

[[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin Wattenberg]] and [[Craig Brians]], of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and [[Shanto Iyengar]] in 1995&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"&gt;Ansolabehere, S. &amp; Iyengar, S. (1995). Going negative: How campaign advertising shrinks and polarizes the electorate. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. [[Rick Farmer]], PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the [[University of Akron]] found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622031838/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-22 |title=Sock it to 'em: can a negative marketing campaign have positive results?

Most recently, [[Kyle Mattes]] and [[David P. Redlawsk]] in ''The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning'' show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing [[voter turnout]] and radicalizing politics.&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"/&gt; 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization.  While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.&lt;ref name="Garramone 1990"&gt;Garramone, G. M., Atkin, C. K., Pinkleton, B. E., &amp; Cole, R. T. (1990, Summer). Effects of Negative Political Advertising on the Political Process. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 34(3), 299–311. {{doi|10.1080/08838159009386744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative ads can produce a backlash. A [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|disastrous ad]] was run by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 Canadian federal election]], apparently emphasizing [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Bell's Palsy]] partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] for running an [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|attack ad]] that suggested that [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence "we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of "whoever the idiot who approved that ad was," shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in [[Afghanistan]] at the time.  (See [[Canadian federal election, 2006]])

More recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in [[North Carolina]], Republican incumbent [[Elizabeth Dole]] attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger [[Kay Hagan]], who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to [[atheists]]. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying "There is no God!" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the [[2008 financial crisis]]). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be "going negative," with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013318/http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the [[University of Delaware]], in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at [[Texas Tech University]], and Sungkyoung Lee of [[Indiana University]], which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the "startle response," the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545187/ Viewers Are Repulsed by Negative Campaign Ads] Newswise, Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative cutting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Dominic|title=Film Technology in Post Production|publisher=CRC Press, 2012|isbn= 9781136049774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''negative matching''' and '''negative conforming''') is the process of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the [[film editor]]. [[Original camera negative]] (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a [[film splicer]] and [[film cement]]. Negative cutting is part of the [[post-production]] process and occurs after editing and prior to striking [[internegative]]s and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process.  Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on [[keykode]].

Toward the late 1990s and early 2000s negative cutting changed due to the advent of [[digital cinema]] technologies such as [[digital intermediate]] (DI), digital projection and [[high-definition television]]. In some countries, due to the high cost of online suites, negative cutting is still used for commercials by reducing footage. Increasingly feature films are bypassing the negative cutting process altogether and are being scanned directly from the uncut [[Dailies|rushes]].

The existence of [[digital intermediate]]s (DI) has created a new demand for negative cutters to extract [[selected takes]] which are cut from the [[Dailies|rushes]] and re-spliced into new rolls (in edit order) to reduce the volume of footage for scanning.

== Basic ==
After a film shoot, the [[original camera negative]] (OCN) is sent to a film laboratory for processing. Two or three {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} camera rolls are spliced together to create a lab roll approximately {{convert|1200|-|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. After developing the lab roll, it is put through a [[telecine]] to create a [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape. This [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape is of lower quality than film and is used for editing purposes only.

The [[Dailies|rushes]] tape is sent to the Editor who loads it into an offline edit suite. The lab rolls are sent to the negative cutter for logging and storage.

After the Editor finishes the Edit it is exported to an offline [[edit decision list|EDL list]] and the EDL list is sent to the negative cutter. The negative cutter will translate the Timecode in the EDL list to edge numbers ([[keykode]]) using specially designed negative cutting software to find which shot is needed from the [[Juncaceae|rushes]] negative.

Traditionally a negative cutter would then fine cut the negative to match the Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative would be spliced together to create rolls less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} which would then be sent to the film laboratory to print release prints.

Today most feature films are extracted full takes (as [[selected takes]]) and scanned digitally as a [[digital intermediate]]. Television series and commercials shot on film follow the same extraction process but are sent for [[telecine]]. Each required shot is extracted from the lab roll as a full take and [[Film splicer|respliced]] together to create a new selected roll of negative. This reduces the negative required by up to 1/10 of the footage shot, saving considerable time during scanning or telecine. The negative cutter will create a new Online EDL list replacing the [[Dailies|rushes]] roll timecode with the new selected roll timecode.

In the case of feature films the selected roll and Online EDL are sent to a post production facility for scanning as a [[digital intermediate]]. For television commercials or series the selected takes and EDL are sent to a post production facility for re-telecine and compiled in an Online Suite for final grading.

== Software ==

There have been a number of dedicated software systems that have been developed for and by negative cutters to manage the process of cutting motion picture negative. A number of individual proprietary software systems have been developed starting in the early 1980s. Stan Sztaba developed a system for World Cinevision Services Inc (New York) in 1983 using Apple II DOS and then [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], this system is still used today. Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using [[MS-DOS]]. Computamatch was one of the first [[MS-DOS]]-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.

The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain. Film Fusion is one of the most recent developments and is a Windows XP and Vista based system developed in Sydney, Australia by Popsoft IT.

== Hardware ==

Negative cutters use various hardware tools such as film [[Synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizers]], re-winders, [[film splicer]]s, scissors, [[film cement]] and film keykode readers. [[DigiSync]], a purpose built keykode reader is used by most negative cutters in conjunction with software for logging the keykode from film. [[DigiSync]] was developed by [[Research In Motion]] and in 1998 it won a Technical Achievement Academy Award for the design and development of the [[DigiSync]] Film Keykode Reader. [[Research In Motion]] later moved on to bigger things and invented the [[BlackBerry]] Wireless Email Phone and is now a publicly listed company. Other brands of  barcode scanners are also in use.

==Structure==
The NELF-A subunit is encoded by the gene [[WHSC2]] (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 2).  Microsequencing analysis demonstrated that NELF-B was the protein previously identified as the protein encoded by the gene [[COBRA1]], and was shown to interact with [[BRCA1]].&lt;ref name=narita2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Narita|first1=Takashi|last2=Yamaguchi|first2=Yuki|last3=Yano|first3=Keiichi|last4=Sugimoto|first4=Seiji|last5=Chanarat|first5=Sittinan|last6=Wada|first6=Tadashi|last7=Kim|first7=Dong-ki|last8=Hasegawa|first8=Jun|last9=Omori|first9=Masashi|last10=Inukai|first10=Naoto|last11=Endoh|first11=Masaki|last12=Yamada|first12=Tomoko|last13=Handa|first13=Hiroshi|title=Human Transcription Elongation Factor NELF: Identification of Novel Subunits and Reconstitution of the Functionally Active Complex|journal=Molecular and Cellular Biology|date=15 March 2003|volume=23|issue=6|pages=1863–1873|doi=10.1128/MCB.23.6.1863-1873.2003|url=http://mcb.asm.org/content/23/6/1863|accessdate=18 December 2014|pmid=12612062|pmc=149481}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unknown whether or not NELF-C and NELF-D are peptides resulting from the same mRNA with different translation initiation sites, possibly differing only in an extra 9 amino acids for NELF-C at the N-terminus, or peptides from different mRNAs entirely.  A single NELF complex consists of either NELF-C or NELF-D but not both.  NELF-E is also known as [[RDBP]].&lt;ref name=narita2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=yamaguchi1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamaguchi|first1=Yuki|last2=Takagi|first2=Toshiyuki|last3=Wada|first3=Tadashi|last4=Yano|first4=Keiichi|last5=Furuya|first5=Akiko|last6=Sugimoto|first6=Seiji|last7=Hasegawa|first7=Jun|last8=Handa|first8=Hiroshi|title=NELF, a Multisubunit Complex Containing RD, Cooperates with DSIF to Repress RNA Polymerase II Elongation|journal=Cell|date=April 1999|volume=97|issue=1|pages=41–51|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80713-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400807138|accessdate=18 December 2014|pmid=10199401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NELF binds in a stable complex with [[DSIF]] and RNA polymerase II together, but not with either alone.  [[P-TEFb]] (positive transcription elongation factor b) inhibits the effect of NELF and DSIF on Pol II elongation, via its phosphorylation of [[serine]]-2 of the C-terminal domain of Pol II, and the SPT5 subunit of DSIF, causing dissociation of NELF.&lt;ref name=narita2003 /&gt;  NELF homologues exist in some [[metazoan]]s (e.g. insects and vertebrates) but have not been found in plants, yeast, or nematode (worms).&lt;ref name=narita2003 /&gt;

'''Negative liberty''' is freedom from interference by other people. Negative liberty is primarily concerned with freedom from external restraint and contrasts with [[positive liberty]] (the possession of the power and resources to fulfil one's own potential). The distinction was introduced by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in his 1958 lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]".

== Overview ==
''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes negative liberty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The negative concept of freedom ... is most commonly assumed in liberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of liberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist or moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences of the right to private property, although some have contested the claim that private property necessarily enhances negative liberty."&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Gerald Cohen|Cohen, G. A.]], 1991, ''Capitalism, Freedom and the Proletariat''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
According to [[Thomas Hobbes]], "a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and will he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Part 2, Ch. XXI; thus alluding to liberty in its negative sense).

[[Claude Adrien Helvétius]] expressed the following point clearly: "The free man is the man who is not in irons, nor imprisoned in a gaol, nor terrorized like a slave by the fear of punishment ... it is not lack of freedom, not to fly like an eagle or swim like a whale." Moreover, [[John Jay]], in [[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' paper]] [[Federalist No. 2|No. 2]], stated that: "Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of Government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers." Jay's meaning would be better expressed by substituting "negative liberty" in place of "natural rights", for the argument here is that the power or authority of a legitimate government derives in part from our accepting restrictions on negative liberty.

An idea that anticipates the distinction between negative and positive liberty was [[G. F. W. Hegel]]'s "[[sphere of abstract right]]" (furthered in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''), which constitutes what now is called negative freedom and his subsequent distinction between "abstract" and "positive liberty."&lt;ref&gt;George Klosko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O5XvGdmuTkkC&amp;dq= ''History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume II: Modern''] (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 465: "we should note that Hegel's realization of the distance between his own and the traditional liberal conception of freedom, which he calls "abstract freedom," is clear in his embrace of [[positive freedom]] [in [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR149 ''PR'' §149A]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lee Goodfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n9vpAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq= ''Hegel and the Metaphysical Frontiers of Political Theory''], Routledge, 2014: "Hegel's collective vision of positive liberty in and through ''[[Sittlichkeit]]'' is reduced to no more than the "mischief" and "mystification" of an amoral, regressive and anti-liberal political vision."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Anglophone [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition the distinction between negative and positive liberty was introduced by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in his 1958 lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]". According to Berlin, the distinction is deeply embedded in the political tradition. In Berlin's words, "liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'."&lt;ref name="Berlin, I. 1958"&gt;Berlin, I. (1958). "Two Concepts of Liberty." In Isaiah Berlin (1969): ''Four Essays on Liberty''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on negative liberty are imposed by a person, not by natural causes or incapacity.

[[Frankfurt School]] [[psychoanalyst]] and [[humanistic]] [[philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]] drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in his 1941 work, ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'', that predates Berlin's essay by more than a decade.  Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms.  This aspect of freedom, he argues, "is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1966):26.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Fromm, then, negative freedom marks the beginning of humanity as a species conscious of its own existence free from base instinct.

The distinction between positive and negative liberty is considered specious by some [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] political philosophers, who argue that positive and negative liberty are indistinguishable in practice, or that one cannot exist without the other.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Negative/Positive Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he is not a socialist nor a Marxist, Berlin argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It follows that a frontier must be drawn between the area of private life and that of public authority. Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others."&lt;ref name="Berlin, I. 1958"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Libertarian]] thinker [[Tibor Machan]] defends negative liberty as "required for moral choice and, thus, for human flourishing," claiming that it "is secured when the rights of individual members of a human community to life, to voluntary action (or to liberty of conduct), and to property are universally respected, observed, and defended."

== Negative liberty and authority: Hobbes and Locke ==

One might ask, "How is men's desire for liberty to be reconciled with the assumed need for authority?" Its answer by various thinkers provides a fault line for understanding their view on liberty but also a cluster of intersecting concepts such as authority, equality, and justice.

[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] give two influential and representative solutions to this question. As a starting point, both agree that a line must be drawn and a space sharply delineated where each individual can act unhindered according to their tastes, desires, and inclinations. This zone defines the sacrosanct space of personal liberty. But, they believe no society is possible without some authority, where the intended purpose of authority is to prevent collisions among the different ends and, thereby, to demarcate the boundaries where each person's zone of liberty begins and ends. Where Hobbes and Locke differ is the extent of the zone. Hobbes, who took a rather negative view of human nature, argued that a strong authority was needed to curb men's intrinsically wild, savage, and corrupt impulses. Only a powerful authority can keep at bay the permanent and always looming threat of anarchy. Locke believed, on the other hand, that men on the whole are more good than wicked and, accordingly, the area for individual liberty can be left rather at large.

Locke is a slightly more ambiguous case than Hobbes because although his conception of liberty was largely negative (in terms of non-interference), he differed in that he courted the republican tradition of liberty by rejecting the notion that an individual could be free if he was under the arbitrary power of another:

"This ''freedom'' from absolute, arbitrary power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a man's preservation, that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his preservation and life together: for a man, not having the power of his own life, cannot, by compact, or his own consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he pleases. No body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it. Indeed, having by his fault forfeited his own life, by some act that deserves death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in his power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service, and he does him no injury by it: for, whenever he finds the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life, it is in his power, by resisting the will of his master, to draw on himself the death he desires."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr04.htm John Locke: ''Second Treatise of Civil Government'', Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concrete example ==

This section outlines specific examples of governmental types which follow the concept of negative liberty.

===Monarchy===
Thomas Hobbes' [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] outlines a commonwealth based upon a monarchy to whom citizens have ceded their rights. The basic reasoning for Hobbes' assertion that this system was most ideal relates more to Hobbes' value of order and simplicity in government. The monarchy provides for its subjects, and its subjects go about their day-to-day lives without interaction with the government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: ''I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.''

The sovereign has twelve principal rights:

# because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) change the form of government.
# because the covenant forming the commonwealth is the subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them, the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.
# the selection of sovereign is (in theory) by majority vote; the minority have agreed to abide by this.
# every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his subjects, and cannot be accused of injustice.
# following this, the sovereign cannot justly be put to death by the subjects.
# because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord, therefore the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse; who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes; and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.
# to prescribe the rules of civil law and property.
# to be judge in all cases.
# to make war and peace as he sees fit; and to command the army.
# to choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.
# to reward with riches and honour; or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or ignominy.
# to establish laws of honour and a scale of worth.

Hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of ''Separation of Powers'', in particular the form that would later become the [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution]]. Part 6 is a perhaps under-emphasised feature of Hobbes's argument: his is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech, should they be considered desirable by the sovereign in order to promote order.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon closer inspection of Hobbes' ''Leviathan'', it becomes clear that Hobbes believed individual people in society must give up liberty to a sovereign. Whether that sovereign is an absolute monarch or other form was left open to debate, however Hobbes himself viewed the absolute monarch as the best of all options. Hobbes himself said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For as amongst masterless men, there is perpetual war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the son, nor to expect from the father; no propriety of goods, or lands; no security; but a full and absolute liberty in every particular man: so in states, and commonwealths not dependent on one another, every commonwealth, not every man, has an absolute liberty, to do what it shall judge, that is to say, what that man, or assembly that representeth it, shall judge most conducing to their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works'', vol. III (''Leviathan''). 1651: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/585/89860 Part 1, Ch. XIX]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From this quote it is clear that Hobbes contended that people in a [[state of nature]] ceded their [[natural rights|individual rights]] to create [[sovereignty]], retained by the state, in return for their protection and a more functional society. In essence, a social contract between the sovereign and citizens evolves out of pragmatic self-interest. Hobbes named the state ''Leviathan'', thus pointing to the artifice involved in the social contract. In this vein, Hobbes' concept of negative liberty was built upon the notion that the state would not act upon its subjects because its subjects had willingly relinquished their liberties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31935">In [[theoretical physics]], '''negative mass''' is matter whose [[mass]] is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter, e.g. −1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/negative-mass-object-washington-state-physics-isaac-newton-upside-down-a7693701.html "Scientists observe liquid with 'negative mass', which turns physics completely upside down"], ''The Independent'', April 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fluid-negative-mass-1.4073937 "Scientists create fluid that seems to defy physics:'Negative mass' reacts opposite to any known physical property we know"], ''CBC'', April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such matter would violate one or more [[energy condition]]s and show some strange properties, stemming from the ambiguity as to whether attraction should refer to force or the oppositely oriented acceleration for negative mass. It is used in certain speculative [[hypothesis]], such as on the construction of traversable [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Initially, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

[[General relativity]] describes [[gravity]] and the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] for both positive and [[negative energy]] particles, hence negative mass, but does not include the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]]. On the other hand, the [[Standard Model]] describes [[elementary particle]]s and the other fundamental forces, but it does not include gravity. A unified theory that explicitly includes gravity along with the other fundamental forces may be needed for a better understanding of the concept of negative mass.

==In general relativity==
Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This could occur due to a region of space in which the stress component of the Einstein [[stress–energy tensor]] is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive [[energy condition]] of Einstein's general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory.

===Inertial versus gravitational mass===

Ever since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] first formulated his theory of [[gravity]], there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called [[mass]]:
*[[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass ''m'' that appears in Newton's second law of motion, '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;thinsp;'''a'''
*“active” [[gravitational mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to 
*“passive” gravitational mass &amp;ndash; the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating.

Einstein’s [[equivalence principle]] postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. All experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same.

In his 4th-prize essay for the 1951 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition, [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger]] considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces.&lt;ref name="Luttinger 1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luttinger |first=J. M. |year=1951 |title=On "Negative" mass in the theory of gravitation |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852e579be659442a01f27b8/t/5873dc04d1758eea4b41c720/1483987972731/luttinger.pdf |journal=Awards for Essays on Gravitation |publisher=Gravity Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, following Luttinger's idea, [[Hermann Bondi]] suggested in a paper in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' that mass might be negative as well as positive.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.423 |title=Negative Mass in General Relativity |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=423 |year=1957 |last1=Bondi |first1=H. |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..423B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter-intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally).

There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=R. M.|title=Negative mass can be positively amusing|journal=Am. J. Phys.|date=1993|volume=61|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1119/1.17293 |url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ccline/courses/resources/wp/pdf/AJP000216.pdf|bibcode = 1993AmJPh..61..216P }}&lt;/ref&gt; however none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the [[Energy condition#Dominant energy condition|dominant energy condition]]. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its [[ADM formalism|ADM mass]] must be positive, which is of course not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shoen|first1=R.|last2=Yao|first2=S.-T.|title=On the proof of the positive mass conjecture in general relativity|journal=Commun. Math. Phys.|date=1979|volume=65|pages=45–76 |url=http://www.doctoryau.com/papers/PositiveMassConjecture.pdf|bibcode = 1979CMaPh..65...45S |doi = 10.1007/BF01940959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witten|first1=Edward|title=A new proof of the positive energy theorem|journal=Comm.

===Runaway motion===
Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily [[Hermann Bondi]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; [[William B. Bonnor]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00763458| title = Negative mass in general relativity| journal = General Relativity and Gravitation| volume = 21| issue = 11| pages = 1143| year = 1989| last1 = Bonnor | first1 = W. B.|bibcode = 1989GReGr..21.1143B }}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Robert L. Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2514/3.23219| title = Negative matter propulsion| journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power| volume = 6| pages = 28| year = 1990| last1 = Forward | first1 = R. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[equivalence principle]]:

* Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses.
* Negative mass repels  both other negative masses and positive masses.

For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time.

Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; an effect called "runaway motion" by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: 
{{Centered pull quote
 |I regard the runaway (or self-accelerating) motion […] so preposterous that I prefer to rule it out by supposing that inertial mass is all positive or all negative.
|author= William B. Bonnor
|source=in ''Negative mass in general relativity''.&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;}}

Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain 0.

This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behaviour of 'normal' matter; but is completely mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{sys} = mv + (-m)v = \big(m+(-m)\big)v = 0\times v = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And equivalently for the [[kinetic energy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k,sys} = \tfrac12 mv^2 + \tfrac12(-m)v^2 = \tfrac12\big(m+(-m)\big)v^2 = \tfrac12(0)v^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account.

Forward extended Bondi's analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(−)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;}} are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass.

This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in [[temperature]] without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] pointed out other implications of Forward's analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G.|last= Landis|title=Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion|journal=J. Propulsion and Power|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 304 |year=1991|doi=10.2514/3.23327}}&lt;/ref&gt; including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the [[electrostatic force]] would be attractive for like [[charge (physics)|charges]] and repulsive for opposite charges.

Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for [[spacecraft propulsion]] using negative mass that requires no energy input and no [[Working mass|reaction mass]] to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration.

Forward also coined a term, "nullification", to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other's existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and negative mass matter (of negative energy {{math|−''E'' {{=}} −''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, all such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum, which is classically forbidden. So once this runaway phenomenon has been revealed, the [[scientific community]] considered negative mass could not exist in the universe.

===Arrow of time and energy inversion===
In 1970, [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] demonstrated, through the complete [[Poincaré group]] of dynamic [[group theory]], that reversing the energy of a particle (hence its mass, if the particle has one) is equal to reversing its [[arrow of time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |date=1970 |title=Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques |trans-title=Structure of Dynamic Systems |url=http://www.jmsouriau.com/structure_des_systemes_dynamiques.htm |location=Paris |publisher=Dunod |page=199 |language=French |issn=0750-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |title=Structure of Dynamical Systems |chapter=A mechanistic description of elementary particles: Inversions of space and time |location=Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-4612-6692-1 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0281-3_14 |url=http://ayuba.fr/souriau/Souriau-time-energy-mass-inversion.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe according to [[general relativity]] is a [[Riemannian manifold]] associated to a [[metric tensor]] solution of Einstein’s field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion prevents the existence of negative matter.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;

Some [[bimetric theory|bimetric theories]] of the universe propose that two [[multiverse|parallel universes]] instead of one may exist with an opposite arrow of time, linked together by the [[Big Bang]] and interacting only through [[gravitation]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov 1980"&gt;A.D.

According to group theory, the matter of the [[Topological conjugacy|conjugated]] metric would appear to the matter of the other metric as having opposite mass and arrow of time (though its [[proper time]] would remain positive). The coupled metrics have their own [[geodesic]]s and are solutions of two coupled field equations:&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-2106-5 |title=Negative mass hypothesis in cosmology and the nature of dark energy |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=354 |issue=2 |pages=611 |year=2014 |last1=Petit |first1=J.

The [[Post-Newtonian expansion|Newtonian approximation]] then provides the following interaction laws:
* Positive mass attracts positive mass.
* Negative mass attracts negative mass.
* Positive mass and negative mass repel each other.
Those laws are different to the laws described by Bondi and Bonnor, and solve the runaway paradox. The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] and [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petit 2014b" /&gt;

===In Gauss's law of gravity===
In [[electromagnetism]] one can derive the energy density of a field from [[Gauss's law]], assuming the curl of the field is 0. Performing the same calculation using [[Gauss's law for gravity]] produces a negative energy density for a gravitational field.

===Gravitational interaction of antimatter===
{{Main|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}
The overwhelming consensus among physicists is that [[antimatter]] has positive mass and should be affected by gravity just like normal matter. Direct experiments on neutral [[antihydrogen]] have not been sensitive enough to detect any difference between the gravitational interaction of antimatter, compared to normal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2787 |pmid=23653197 |pmc=3644108 |title=Description and first application of a new technique to measure the gravitational mass of antihydrogen |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1785 |year=2013 |last1=Amole |first1=C. |last2=Ashkezari |first2=M.

[[Bubble chamber]] experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in [[Helix|helical]] paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle–antiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle–antiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner.

==Experimentation==
Physicist Peter Engels and a team of colleagues at [[Washington State University]] claimed to have observed negative mass behavior in rubidium atoms. On 10 April 2017 Engels team created negative "effective" mass by reducing the temperature of rubidium atoms to near [[absolute zero]], generating a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. By using a laser-trap, the team were able to reverse the spin of some of the rubidium atoms in this state, and observed that once released from the trap, the atoms expanded and displayed properties of negative mass, in particular accelerating towards a pushing force instead of away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39642992|title=Physicists observe 'negative mass'|date=2017-04-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301 |pmid=28452531 |title=Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbit–coupled Bose–Einstein Condensate |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=118 |issue=15 |pages=155301 |year=2017 |last1=Khamehchi |first1=M. A. |last2=Hossain |first2=Khalid |last3=Mossman |first3=M. E. |last4=Zhang |first4=Yongping |last5=Busch |first5=Th. |last6=Forbes |first6=Michael Mcneil |last7=Engels |first7=P. |bibcode=2017PhRvL.118o5301K |arxiv=1612.04055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This kind of negative effective mass is analogous to the well-known apparent negative effective mass of electrons in the upper part of the dispersion bands in solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N. W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N. D.|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Saunders College|location=Philadelphia|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither case is negative mass for the purposes of the [[stress–energy tensor]].

Some recent work with [[metamaterial]]s suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered composite of superconductors, metamaterials and normal matter could exhibit signs of negative effective mass in much the same way as low temperature alloys melt at below the melting point of their components or some semiconductors have negative differential resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2014.10.036 |title=Novel negative mass density resonant metamaterial unit cell |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=379 |pages=33 |year=2015 |last1=Cselyuszka |first1=Norbert |last2=Sečujski |first2=Milan |last3=Crnojević-Bengin |first3=Vesna |bibcode=2015PhLA..379...33C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In quantum mechanics==
In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of [[elementary particle]]s, now part of the [[Standard Model]], already included negative solutions.&lt;ref name="Dirac 1928"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0023 |title=The Quantum Theory of the Electron |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |volume=117 |issue=778 |pages=610 |year=1928 |last1=Dirac |first1=P. A. M. |bibcode=1928RSPSA.117..610D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory.

[[Mike Morris (physicist)|Morris]], [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] and Yurtsever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |pmid=10038800 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael S. |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the [[Casimir effect]] can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space–time. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a [[wormhole]]. Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/9409051 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3117 |title=Natural wormholes as gravitational lenses |journal=Physical Review D |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=3117 |year=1995 |last1=Cramer |first1=John G. |last2=Forward |first2=Robert L. |last3=Morris |first3=Michael S. |last4=Visser |first4=Matt |last5=Benford |first5=Gregory |last6=Landis |first6=Geoffrey A. |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.3117C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] has proved that [[negative energy]] is a necessary condition for the creation of a [[closed timelike curve]] by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space;&lt;ref name="futureofspacetime"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawking | first = Stephen | title = The Future of Spacetime | publisher = W. W. Norton |year= 2002 | pages = 96 | isbn = 0-393-02022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this proves, for example, that a finite [[Tipler cylinder]] cannot be used as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

===Schrödinger equation===
For energy eigenstates of the [[Schrödinger equation]], the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle's energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in [[quantum mechanics]], and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue.

For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as [[photon]]s), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass–energy. However, the Schrödinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] is required.

==In special relativity==
{{See also|Exotic matter|Faster-than-light}}
One can achieve a negative mass independent of [[negative energy]]. According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass {{mvar|m}} is in proportion to energy {{mvar|E}} and the coefficient of proportionality is {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Actually, {{mvar|m}} is still equivalent to {{mvar|E}} although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wang, Z.Y, Wang P.Y, Xu Y.R.| date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham–Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22| bibcode=2011Optik.122.1994W | arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as {{math|−''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E&amp;=-mc^2&gt;0 \\
m&amp;= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances,

:&lt;math&gt;dE=F\,ds=\frac{dp}{dt}\,ds=\frac{ds}{dt}\,dp=v\,dp=v\,d(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

and so,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-c^2\,dm&amp;=v\,d(mv) \\
-c^2(2m)\,dm&amp;=2mv\,d(mv) \\
-c^2\,d(m^2)&amp;=d(m^2v^2) \\
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2+C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-m^2c^2&amp;=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2 \\
m&amp;=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}} is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}}. The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

From the above relation,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], the [[inverse Doppler effect]] and the [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the force is defined as {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}. [[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy–momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''ħω''}} and [[de Broglie]]'s {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_\mathrm{p}^2\,, \quad \left(E_0=\hbar\omega_\mathrm{p}=-m_0c^2&gt;0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy–momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt; ([[wave–particle duality]]) and can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&lt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&lt;c \\
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&gt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&gt;c
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\mathrm{k} &amp;= E-E_0 \\
&amp;=-mc^2-\left(-m_0 c^2\right) \\
&amp;=-\frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + m_0 c^2 \\
&amp;= m_0 c^2 \left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\right)&lt;0\,, \quad \left(\mbox{where }m_0&lt;0\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell|first=R. R.|title=A phantom menace?

In this way, the negative mass of exotic matter is now associated with [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], [[negative kinetic energy]] and [[faster-than-light]] phenomena.

In [[statistics]], there is a '''negative relationship''' or '''inverse relationship''' between two variables if higher values of one variable tend to be associated with lower values of the other. A negative relationship between two variables usually implies that the [[correlation]] between them is negative, or &amp;mdash; what is in some contexts equivalent &amp;mdash; that the [[slope]] in a corresponding graph is negative. A '''negative correlation''' between variables is also called '''anticorrelation''' or '''inverse correlation'''.

Negative correlation can be seen geometrically when two normalized [[random vector]]s are viewed as points on a sphere, and the [[Pearson correlation coefficient#Geometric interpretation|correlation]] between them is the [[cosine]] of the arc of separation of the points on the sphere.&lt;ref&gt; R. J. Rummel [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/UC.HTM Understanding Correlation] from [[University of Hawaii]]&lt;/ref&gt; When this arc is more than a quarter-circle (&amp;theta; &gt; &amp;pi;/2), then the cosine is negative. [[Diametrically opposed]] points represent a correlation of –1 = cos(&amp;pi;). Any two points not in the same hemisphere have negative correlation.

An example would be a negative [[cross-sectional]] relationship between illness and vaccination, if it is observed that where the incidence of one is higher than average, the incidence of the other tends to be lower than average. Similarly, there would be a negative [[time series|temporal]] relationship between illness and vaccination if it is observed in one location that times with a higher-than-average incidence of one tend to coincide with a lower-than-average incidence of the other.

A particular inverse relationship is called [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inverse proportionality]], and is given by &lt;math&gt;y = k/x &lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' &gt; 0 is a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]]. In a [[Cartesian plane]] this relationship is displayed as a [[hyperbola]] with ''y'' decreasing as ''x'' increases.&lt;ref&gt;The [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\ y \prime = \frac{-k}{x^2} \ &lt;/math&gt; is negative for [[positive real numbers]] ''x'' and as well for negative real numbers. Thus the slope is everywhere negative except at the [[singular point of a curve|singularity]] ''x'' = 0.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[finance]], an inverse correlation between the [[rate of return|returns]] on two different assets enhances the [[financial risk|risk]]-reduction effect of  [[diversification (finance)|diversifying]] by holding them both in the same portfolio.

If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, causing it to [[arc flash]] and destroy itself.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''.

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]

Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

*&lt;u&gt;Passive negative differential resistance devices&lt;/u&gt; (fig. 2 above): These are the most well-known type of "negative resistances"; passive two-terminal components whose intrinsic ''I–V'' curve has a downward "kink", causing the current to decrease with increasing voltage over a limited range.&lt;ref name="Prasad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; The ''I–V'' curve, including the negative resistance region, lies in the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the plane&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; so the device has positive static resistance.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; Examples are [[gas-discharge tube]]s, [[tunnel diode]]s, and [[Gunn diode]]s.&lt;ref name="Rybin" /&gt; These devices have no internal power source and in general work by converting external DC power from their port to time varying (AC) power,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt; so they require a DC bias current applied to the port in addition to the signal.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; To add to the confusion, some authors&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rybin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; call these "active" devices, since they can amplify.

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

An intrinsic parameter used to compare different devices is the ''peak-to-valley current ratio'' (PVR),&lt;ref name="Franz" /&gt; the ratio of the current at the top of the negative resistance region to the current at the bottom ''(see graphs, above)'':
:&lt;math&gt;\text{PVR} = i_1 / i_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The larger this is, the larger the potential AC output for a given DC bias current, and therefore the greater the efficiency

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

For simple nonreactive negative resistance devices with &lt;math&gt;R_N\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_N\;=\;0&lt;/math&gt; the different operating regions of the device can be illustrated by [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s on the ''I–V'' curve&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; ''(see graphs)''.

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],

*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

A common example of an "active resistance" circuit is the [[negative impedance converter]] (NIC)&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linvill"&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit,&lt;ref name="Maxim"&gt;{{cite web

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt; So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

[[File:Negative resistance oscillator load lines.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Gunn diode oscillator [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In oscillators where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; just small enough to allow the oscillator to start, the voltage swing will be mostly limited to the linear portion of the ''I–V'' curve, the output waveform will be nearly sinusoidal and the frequency will be most stable. In circuits in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is far below &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,&lt;ref name="Kung2" /&gt; and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K.

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;math&gt;R_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative resistance of the diode '''''−r'''''. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so &lt;math&gt;X_1\;=\;-X_N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; then the gain is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

[[Image:Rubin2.jpg|thumb|[[Rubin vase|Rubin's vase]] is an [[optical illusion]] in which the negative space around the vase forms the silhouettes of two faces in profile, a well-known example of [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground reversal by emphasizing that negative space]]]]
[[Image:FedEx Corporation logo.svg|thumb|FedEx logo displays an arrow between letters '''E''' and '''x'''. Not being in full silhouette, the effect is subtle and may not be noticed.]]
'''Negative space''', in [[art]], is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.

==Overview==
The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word "[[Ma (negative space)|ma]]" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in [[garden design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/jgard/msg100248139141.html |title=FAQ: 'Ma' and 'Mu' - Japanese Gardens Forum - GardenWeb |publisher=Forums.gardenweb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html |title=ArtLex's Ne-Nz page |publisher=Artlex.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990504184946/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html |archivedate=1999-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfj-online.org/journalPages/MFJ38/iimura.html |title=A Note for MA: Space/Time in the Garden of Ryoan-Ji - Iimura |publisher=Mfj-online.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-tone, black-and-white image, a subject is normally depicted in black and the space around it is left blank (white), thereby forming a [[silhouette]] of the subject. Reversing the tones so that the space around the subject is printed black and the subject itself is left blank, however, causes the negative space to be apparent as it forms shapes around the subject. This is called [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground reversal]].

In [[graphic design]] of printed or displayed materials, where effective communication is the objective, the use of negative space may be crucial. Not only within the [[typography]], but in its placement in relation to the whole. It is the basis of why upper and lower case typography always is more legible than the use of all capital letters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Negative space varies around lower case letters, allowing the human eye to distinguish each word rapidly as one distinctive item, rather than having to parse out what the words are in a [[Space (punctuation)|string of letters]] that all present the same overall profile as in all caps. The same judicious use of negative space drives the [[white space (visual arts)|effectiveness of the entire design]]. Because of the long history of the use of black ink on white paper, "[[white space (visual arts)|white space]]" is the term often used in graphics to identify the same separation.

Elements of an image that distract from the intended subject, or in the case of [[photography]], objects in the same [[focal plane]], are not considered negative space. Negative space may be used to depict a subject in a chosen medium by showing everything around the subject, but not the subject itself. Use of negative space will produce a [[silhouette]] of the subject. Most often, negative space is used as a neutral or contrasting background to draw attention to the main subject, which then is referred to as the positive space.

==Use==
Considering and improving the balance between negative space and positive space in a composition is considered by many to enhance the design. This basic, but often overlooked, principle of design gives the eye a "place to rest," increasing the appeal of a composition through subtle means.

The use of negative space in art may be analogous to silence in music, but only when it is juxtaposed with adjacent musical ideas. As such, there is a difference between inert and active silences in music, where the latter is more closely analogous to negative space in art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12822">'''Negative thermal expansion''' (NTE) is an unusual [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] process in which some materials contract upon heating, rather than expand as most other materials do. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential [[engineering]], [[photonics|photonic]], [[Electronics|electronic]], and [[structural]] applications. For example, if one were to mix a '''negative thermal expansion''' material with a "normal" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to make a zero expansion [[composite material]].

== Origin of negative thermal expansion ==

There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, [[Rigid Unit Modes]] and [[phase transitions]].

Recently, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.07.001|title=Origin of negative thermal expansion phenomenon in solids|year=2011|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shun-Li|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=65|issue=8|pages=664–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in {{chem|Fe|3|Pt}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep07043|pmid=25391631|pmc=4229665|title=Thermal Expansion Anomaly Regulated by Entropy|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=7043|year=2014|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shunli|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E7043L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems ==

Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. [[ice]], [[graphene]], etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. {{Chem|Cu|2|O}}, {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}, beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper,&lt;ref name=Rechtsman&gt;{{Citation
 | title =Negative thermal expansion in single-component systems with isotropic interactions

 | last3 = Torquato | first3 = S. | bibcode = 2007JPCA..11112816R| arxiv = 0807.3559}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that negative thermal expansion (NTE) is also realized in single-component close-packed lattices with pair central force interactions. The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed:

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a) &gt;  0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt; is pair [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance. This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. ''An approximate'' necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper&lt;ref name=Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation
 | title = Comment on 'Negative Thermal Expansion in Single-Component Systems with Isotropic Interactions'
 | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A
 | volume = 118
 | issue = 41
 | pages = 9793–4

 |bibcode = 2014JPCA..118.9793K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a)a &gt; -(d-1)\Pi''(a),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is cased by anharmonicity of [[interatomic potential]] only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both &lt;math&gt;\Pi''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi'''&lt;/math&gt; are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications for materials with controlled thermal expansion properties, as thermal expansion causes many problems in engineering, and indeed in everyday life. One simple example of a thermal expansion problem is the tendency of [[dental fillings]] to expand by an amount different from the [[teeth]], for example when drinking a hot drink, causing [[toothache]]. If dental fillings were made of a [[composite material]] containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of [[tooth enamel]].

== Materials ==

Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit ''negative thermal expansion'' is '''[[zirconium tungstate]]''' ({{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}). This compound contracts continuously over a temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Negative Thermal Expansion from 0.3 to 1050 Kelvin in {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=272|issue=5258|pages=90–92|doi= 10.1126/science.272.5258.90|bibcode = 1996Sci...272...90M|last1=Mary|first1=T. A.|last2=Evans|first2=J. S. O.|last3=Vogt|first3=T.|last4=Sleight|first4=A. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials that exhibit this behaviour include: other members of the {{chem|A|M|2|O|8}} family of materials (where A = {{chem|Zr}} or {{chem|Hf}}, M = {{chem|Mo}} or {{chem|W}}) and {{chem|Zr|V|2|O|7}}. {{chem|A|2|({{Chem|M|O|4}})|3}} also is an example of controllable ''negative thermal expansion''.

Ordinary ice shows NTE in its hexagonal and cubic phases at very low temperatures (below –200&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=ice_NTE&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108768194004933|title=Lattice constants and thermal expansion of {{Chem|H|2|O}} and {{Chem|D|2|O}} ice Ih between 10 and 265 K|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|year=1994|volume= 50|pages=644–648|issue=6|last1=Röttger|first1=K.|last2=Endriss|first2=A.|last3=Ihringer|first3=J.|last4=Doyle|first4=S.|last5=Kuhs|first5=W. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its liquid form, pure [[water]] also displays negative thermal expansivity below 3.984&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Rubber elasticity]] shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials. Put simply, as the long polymer chains absorb energy, they adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeleyphysicsdemos.net/node/344 |title=Heating a rubber band: negative coefficient of thermal expansion &amp;#124; Lecture Demonstrations |publisher=Berkeleyphysicsdemos.net |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz ({{chem|Si|O|2}}) and a number of zeolites also show NTE over certain temperature ranges.&lt;ref name=zeolite1&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/b002950p|title=The widespread occurrence of negative thermal expansion in zeolites|journal= Journal of Materials Chemistry|year= 2001|volume= 11|pages=212–216|last1=Lightfoot|first1=Philip|last2=Woodcock|first2=David A.|last3=Maple|first3=Martin J.|last4=Villaescusa|first4=Luis A.|last5=Wright|first5=Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zeolite2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attfield|first1=Martin P.|title=Strong negative thermal expansion in siliceous faujasite|journal= Chemical Communications|year=1998|pages=601–602|doi=10.1039/A707141H|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly pure silicon (Si) has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 K and 120 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = William C. |editor1-last= O'Mara |editor2-first = Robert B. |editor2-last=Herring | editor3-first = Lee P. |editor3-last=Hunt

Cubic [[Scandium trifluoride]] has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-incredible-material-reveal-scandium-trifluoride.html|title=An incredible shrinking material: Engineers reveal how scandium trifluoride contracts with heat|last=Woo|first=Marcus|date=7 November 2011|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|Sc|F|3}} exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="greve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greve|first=Benjamin K.|author2=Kenneth L.

In [[experimental physics]], researchers have proposed '''Non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamic theory''' to describe phenomena observed in the [[Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]].  This theory investigates a [[Fireball concept|fireball]] for [[high-energy particle]] collisions, while using [[Tsallis entropy|Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; Fireballs lead to the bootstrap idea, or [[self-consistency principle]], just as in the [[Boltzmann statistics]] used by [[Rolf Hagedorn]].&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; Assuming the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] gets variations, due to possible symmetrical change, [[Abdel Nasser Tawfik]] applied the non-extensive concepts of high-energy particle production.&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt;&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt;

The motivation to use the non-extensive statistics from Tsallis&lt;ref&gt;C. Tsallis, J Stat Phys 52, 479-487, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the results obtained by Bediaga et al&lt;ref&gt;I. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.&lt;/ref&gt;. They showed that with the substitution of the Boltzmann factor in Hagedorn's theory by the q-exponential function, it was possible to recover good agreement between calculation and experiment, even at energies as high as those achieved at the [[LHC]], with q&gt;1.

==Non-extensive entropy for ideal quantum gas==
The starting point of the theory is [[entropy]] for a non-extensive quantum gas of [[bosons]] and [[fermions]], as proposed by Conroy, Miller and Plastino,&lt;ref name=depp1/&gt; which is given by &lt;math&gt;S_q=S_q^{FD}+S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_q^{FD}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Fermi–Dirac entropy and &lt;math&gt;S_q^{BE}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-extended version of the Bose–Einstein entropy.

That group&lt;ref  name=hage/&gt; and also Clemens and Worku,&lt;ref name=cley1/&gt; the entropy just defined leads to occupation number formulas that reduce to Bediaga's. C. Beck,&lt;ref name=cley2/&gt; shows the power-like tails present in the distributions found in [[high energy physics]] experiments.

== Non-extensive partition function for ideal quantum gas ==
Using the entropy defined above, the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] results are
:&lt;math&gt; \ln[1+Z_q(V_o,T)]=\frac{V_o}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\int_0^{\infty}dm \int_0^{\infty}dp \, p^2 \rho(n;m)[1+(q-1)\beta \sqrt{p^2+m^2}]^{-\frac{nq}{(q-1)}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since experiments have shown that &lt;math&gt;q&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this restriction is adopted.

Another way to write the non-extensive partition function for a fireball is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T)=\int_0^{\infty}\sigma(E)[1+(q-1)\beta E]^{-\frac{q}{(q-1)}} dE\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)&lt;/math&gt; is the density of states of the fireballs.

==Self-consistency principle==
Self-consistency implies that both forms of partition functions must be asymptotically equivalent and that the [[mass spectrum]] and the [[density of states]] must be related to each other by
:&lt;math&gt; log[\rho(m)]= log[\sigma(E)] &lt;/math&gt;,
in the limit of &lt;math&gt;m,E&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large.

The self-consistency can be asymptotically achieved by choosing&lt;ref name=depp1&gt;A. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m^{3/2} \rho(m)=\frac{\gamma}{m}\big[1+(q_o-1) \beta _o m\big]^{\frac{1}{q_o -1}}=\frac{\gamma}{m}[1+(q'_o-1)  m]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(E)=bE^a\big[1+(q'_o-1)E\big]^{\frac{\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a constant and &lt;math&gt;q'_o-1=\beta _o (q_o-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;a,b,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants. For &lt;math&gt;q' \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; the two expressions above approach the corresponding expressions in Hagedorn's theory.

==Main results==
With the mass spectrum and density of states given above, the asymptotic form of the partition function is
:&lt;math&gt; Z_q(V_o,T) \rightarrow \bigg(\frac{1}{\beta - \beta _o }\bigg)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; a+1=\alpha=\frac{\gamma V_o}{2\pi^2 \beta^{3/2}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One immediate consequence of the expression for the partition function is the existence of a limiting temperature &lt;math&gt;T_o=1/\beta _o&lt;/math&gt;. This result is equivalent to Hagedorn's result.&lt;ref  name=hage&gt;R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147.&lt;/ref&gt; With these results, it is expected that at sufficiently high energy, the fireball presents a constant temperature and constant entropic factor.

==Experimental evidence==

Experimental evidence of the existence of a limiting temperature and of a limiting entropic index can be found in [[Jean Cleymans|J. Cleymans]] and collaborators,&lt;ref name=cley1&gt;J.

[[File:William of Ockham - Logica 1341.jpg|thumb|William of Ockham]]
'''Occam's razor''' (also '''Ockham's razor''' or '''Ocham's razor'''; [[Latin]]: ''lex parsimoniae'' "'''law of parsimony'''") is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the correct one. When presented with competing [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to solve a problem, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions. The idea is attributed to English [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Ockham]] (c. 1287–1347), a scholastic philosopher and theologian.

In science, Occam's razor is used as an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] [[heuristic]] in the development of theoretical models, rather than as a rigorous arbiter between candidate models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"&gt;Hugh G. Gauch, ''Scientific Method in Practice, Cambridge University Press'', 2003, {{ISBN|0-521-01708-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-01708-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoffman |first1=Roald |last2=Minkin |first2=Vladimir I. |last3=Carpenter |first3=Barry K. |title=Ockham's Razor and Chemistry |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |date=1997 |volume=3 |pages=3–28 |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/3/hoffman.htm |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scientific method]], Occam's razor is not considered an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result; the preference for simplicity in the scientific method is based on the [[falsifiability]] criterion. For each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there may be an extremely large, perhaps even incomprehensible, number of possible and more complex alternatives.  Since one can always burden failing explanations with [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]] to prevent them from being falsified, simpler theories are preferable to more complex ones because they are more [[test method|testable]].&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"&gt;{{cite book |origyear=2004 |year=2010 |author=Alan Baker |chapter=Simplicity |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/ |publisher=Stanford University |place=California |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2008 |last1=Courtney |first1=A. |last2=Courtney |first2=M. |title=Comments Regarding 'On the Nature of Science' |arxiv=0812.4932 |journal=Physics in Canada |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=7–8|bibcode=2008arXiv0812.4932C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elliott |last=Sober |chapter=Let's Razor Occam's Razor |pages=73–93 |editor-first=Dudley |editor-last=Knowles |title=Explanation and Its Limits |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term ''Occam's razor'' did not appear until a few centuries after [[William of Ockham]]'s death in 1347. [[Libert Froidmont]], in his ''On Christian Philosophy of the Soul'', takes credit for the phrase, speaking of "''novacula occami''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ockam's Razor: A User's Manual|last=Sober|first=Elliott|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=1107692539|location=|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham did not invent this principle, but the "razor"—and its association with him—may be due to the frequency and effectiveness with which he used it.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Ariew, Ockham's Razor: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Ockham's Principle of Parsimony, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham stated the principle in various ways, but the most popular version, "Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity" ({{lang|la|Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate}}) was formulated by the Irish [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] philosopher [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]] in his 1639 commentary on the works of [[Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;Johannes Poncius's commentary on John Duns Scotus's ''Opus Oxoniense,'' book III, dist. 34, q. 1. in John Duns Scotus ''Opera Omnia'', vol.15, Ed. Luke Wadding, Louvain (1639), reprinted Paris: Vives, (1894) p.483a&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formulations before William of Ockham ===
[[File:Pluralitas.jpg|thumb|Part of a page from Duns Scotus' book  ''Commentaria oxoniensia ad IV libros magistri Sententiarus'', novis curis edidit p. Marianus Fernandez Garcia (1914, p. 211)': "{{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}}", i.e., "Plurality is not to be posited without necessity"]]

The origins of what has come to be known as Occam's razor are traceable to the works of earlier philosophers such as [[John Duns Scotus]] (1265–1308), [[Robert Grosseteste]] (1175–1253), [[Maimonides]] (Moses ben-Maimon, 1138–1204), and even [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 189a15, ''On the Heavens'' 271a33. See also Franklin, ''op cit.'' note 44 to chap. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charlesworth | first1 = M. J. | year = 1956 | title = Aristotle's Razor | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies (Ireland) | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 105–112 | doi=10.5840/philstudies1956606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle writes in his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', "We may assume the superiority {{lang|la|ceteris paribus}} [other things being equal] of the demonstration which derives from fewer postulates or hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedians, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC ''Complexity and Dynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617112734/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC |date=17 June 2016 }} citing [[Richard McKeon]] (tr.) Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (1963) p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] ({{nowrap|c. AD 90 – c. AD 168}}) stated, "We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher)|first=James|last=Franklin|year= 2001|title= The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}} Chap 9. p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases such as "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer" and "A plurality is not to be posited without necessity" were commonplace in 13th-century [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] writing.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Robert Grosseteste, in ''Commentary on'' [Aristotle's] ''the Posterior Analytics Books'' (''Commentarius in Posteriorum Analyticorum Libros'') (c. 1217–1220), declares: "That is better and more valuable which requires fewer, other circumstances being equal... For if one thing were demonstrated from many and another thing from fewer equally known premises, clearly that is better which is from fewer because it makes us know quickly, just as a universal demonstration is better than particular because it produces knowledge from fewer premises. Similarly in natural science, in moral science, and in metaphysics the best is that which needs no premises and the better that which needs the fewer, other circumstances being equal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie]], ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science 1100–1700'' (1953) pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) states that "it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many." Aquinas uses this principle to construct an objection to [[God's existence]], an objection that he in turn answers and refutes generally (cf. ''[[quinque viae]]''), and specifically, through an argument based on [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Aquinas acknowledges the principle that today is known as Occam's razor, but prefers causal explanations to other simple explanations (cf. also [[Correlation does not imply causation]]).

=== William of Ockham ===
[[William of Ockham]] (''circa'' 1287–1347) was an English Franciscan friar and [[theologian]], an influential medieval [[philosopher]] and a [[nominalist]]. His popular fame as a great logician rests chiefly on the maxim attributed to him and known as Occam's razor. The term ''razor'' refers to distinguishing between two hypotheses either by "shaving away" unnecessary assumptions or cutting apart two similar conclusions.

While it has been claimed that Occam's razor is not found in any of William's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |first=Jacques |last=Vallee |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331171919/http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; one can cite statements such as {{Lang|la|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate}}[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William%20of%20Occam] ("Plurality must never be posited without necessity"), which occurs in his theological work on the [[The Four Books of Sentences|''Sentences of Peter Lombard'']] (''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi''; ed. Lugd., 1495, i, dist. 27, qu. 2, K).

Nevertheless, the precise words sometimes attributed to William of Ockham, {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem}} (Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Laurie |year=2007 |title=The linguistics Student's Handbook |location=Edinburgh |publisher= Edinburgh University Press}} p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; are absent in his extant works;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Antony |author-link= Antony Flew |year=1979 |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |location=London |publisher=Pan Books}} p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; this particular phrasing comes from [[John Punch (theologian)|John Punch]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alistair Cameron Crombie|Crombie, Alistair Cameron]] (1959), ''Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard, Vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; who described the principle as a "common axiom" (''axioma vulgare'') of the Scholastics.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; William of Ockham's contribution seems to restrict the operation of this principle in matters pertaining to miracles and God's power; so, in the [[Eucharist]], a plurality of miracles is possible, simply because it pleases God.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

This principle is sometimes phrased as {{lang|la|Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate}} ("Plurality should not be posited without necessity").&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |title=Ockham's razor |year=2010 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823154602/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/424706/Ockhams-razor |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Summa Totius Logicae'', i. 12, William of Ockham cites the principle of economy, {{lang|la|Frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora}} ("It is futile to do with more things that which can be done with fewer"; Thorburn, 1918, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–53; [[William Kneale (logician)|Kneale]] and Kneale, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;243.)

=== Later formulations ===
To quote [[Isaac Newton]], "We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances. Therefore, to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes."&lt;ref name="Hawking"&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|first=Stephen |last=Hawking|authorlink=Stephen Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0eRZr_HK0LgC&amp;pg=PA731|page=731|isbn=0-7624-1698-X|year=2003|publisher=Running Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Primary source: {{harvtxt|Newton|2011|p=387}} wrote the following two "philosophizing rules" at the beginning of part&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] 1726 edition.

: Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quæ &amp; veræ sint &amp; earum phænomenis explicandis sufficient.
: Regula II. Ideoque effectuum naturalium ejusdem generis eædem assignandæ sunt causæ, quatenus fieri potest.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] offers a particular version of Occam's razor: "Whenever possible, substitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to unknown entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-construction/|title=Logical Constructions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1960, [[Ray Solomonoff]] founded the [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]], the theory of prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols. The only assumption is that the environment follows some unknown but computable probability distribution.

[[Ernst Mach]] formulated the stronger version of Occam's razor into [[physics]], which he called the Principle of Economy stating: "Scientists must use the simplest means of arriving at their results and exclude everything not perceived by the senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Philosophical Views of Ernst Mach |first=Erich |last=Becher |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=1905 |pages=535–562 |doi=10.2307/2177489 |jstor=2177489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle goes back at least as far as Aristotle, who wrote "Nature operates in the shortest way possible."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt; The idea of parsimony or simplicity in deciding between theories, though not the intent of the original expression of Occam's razor, has been assimilated into our culture as the widespread layman's formulation that "the simplest explanation is usually the correct one."&lt;ref name="math.ucr.edu"/&gt;

== Justifications ==

=== Aesthetic ===
Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus more likely to be true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from [[theology]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] made this argument in the 13th century, writing, "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous to do it by means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [if] one suffices."&lt;ref&gt;Pegis 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 20th century, [[epistemology|epistemological]] justifications based on [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], [[logic]], [[pragmatism]], and especially [[probability theory]] have become more popular among philosophers.{{Who|date=July 2014}}

=== Empirical ===
Occam's razor has gained strong empirical support in helping to converge on better theories (see "Applications" section below for some examples).

In the related concept of [[overfitting]], excessively complex models are affected by [[statistical noise]] (a problem also known as the bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better [[predictive inference|predictive]] performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. [[model selection]], [[test set]], [[minimum description length]], [[Bayesian inference]], etc.).

==== Testing the razor ====
The razor's statement that "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones" is amenable to empirical testing. Another interpretation of the razor's statement would be that "simpler hypotheses are generally better than the complex ones". The procedure to test the former interpretation would compare the track records of simple and comparatively complex explanations. If one accepts the first interpretation, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool would then have to be rejected if the more complex explanations were more often correct than the less complex ones (while the converse would lend support to its use). If the latter interpretation is accepted, the validity of Occam's razor as a tool could possibly be accepted if the simpler hypotheses led to correct conclusions more often than not.

[[File:Leprechaun or Clurichaun.png|thumb|Possible explanations can become needlessly complex. It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of [[leprechaun]]s to any explanation, but Occam's razor would prevent such additions unless they were necessary.]]

Some increases in complexity are sometimes necessary. So there remains a justified general bias toward the simpler of two competing explanations. To understand why, consider that for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon, there is always an infinite number of possible, more complex, and ultimately incorrect, alternatives. This is so because one can always burden a failing explanation with an [[ad hoc hypothesis]]. Ad hoc hypotheses are justifications that prevent theories from being falsified. Even other empirical criteria, such as [[consilience]], can never truly eliminate such explanations as competition. Each true explanation, then, may have had many alternatives that were simpler and false, but also an infinite number of alternatives that were more complex and false. But if an alternative ad hoc hypothesis were indeed justifiable, its implicit conclusions would be empirically verifiable. On a commonly accepted repeatability principle, these alternative theories have never been observed and continue to escape observation.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In addition, one does not say an explanation is true if it has not withstood this principle.

Put another way, any new, and even more complex, theory can still possibly be true. For example, if an individual makes [[supernatural]] claims that [[leprechauns]] were responsible for breaking a vase, the simpler explanation would be that he is mistaken, but ongoing ad hoc justifications (e.g. "... and that's not me on the film; they tampered with that, too") successfully prevent outright falsification. This endless supply of elaborate competing explanations, called [[saving hypothesis|saving hypotheses]], cannot be ruled out—except by using Occam's razor.&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education, pp. 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis."

None of the papers provided a balance of evidence that complexity of method improved forecast accuracy. In the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons, complexity increased forecast errors by an average of 27 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = K.

=== Practical considerations and pragmatism ===
{{See also|Pragmatism|Problem of Induction}}

=== Mathematical ===
One justification of Occam's razor is a direct result of basic [[probability theory]]. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.

There have also been other attempts to derive Occam's razor from probability theory, including notable attempts made by [[Harold Jeffreys]] and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|E. T. Jaynes]]. The probabilistic (Bayesian) basis for Occam's razor is elaborated by [[David J. C. MacKay]] in chapter 28 of his book ''Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043535/http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf | archivedate=15 September 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasizes that a prior bias in favour of simpler models is not required.

[[William H. Jefferys]] and [[James Berger (statistician)|James O. Berger]] (1991) generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data.&lt;ref name="Jefferys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jefferys|first=William H.|last2=Berger |first2=James O.|title=Ockham's Razor and Bayesian Statistics |journal=[[American Scientist]]|year=1991|volume=80|issue=1|pages=64–72|jstor=29774559|url=http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304065538/http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/papers/ockham.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2005|df=dmy-all}} (preprint available as "Sharpening Occam's Razor on a Bayesian Strop").&lt;/ref&gt; They state, "A hypothesis with fewer adjustable parameters will automatically have an enhanced posterior probability, due to the fact that the predictions it makes are sharp."&lt;ref name="Jefferys" /&gt; The model they propose balances the precision of a theory's predictions against their sharpness{{vague|date=September 2016}}—preferring theories that sharply{{vague|date=September 2016}} make correct predictions over theories that accommodate a wide range of other possible results. This, again, reflects the mathematical relationship between key concepts in [[Bayesian inference]] (namely [[marginal probability]], [[conditional probability]], and [[posterior probability]]).

The [[bias–variance tradeoff]] is a framework that incorporates the Occam's razor principal in its balance between overfitting (i.e. variance minimization) and underfitting (i.e. bias minimization).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spall |first1=James C. |title=Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780471441908 |pages=330–331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===

==== Karl Popper ====
[[Karl Popper]] argues that a preference for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations. Our preference for simplicity may be justified by its [[falsifiability]] criterion: we prefer simpler theories to more complex ones "because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable" (Popper 1992). The idea here is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable. This is again comparing a simple theory to a more complex theory where both explain the data equally well.

==== Elliott Sober ====
The philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] once argued along the same lines as Popper, tying simplicity with "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, in the sense that it requires less information to a question.&lt;ref name=Sober975&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |year=1975 |title=Simplicity |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-824407-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an [[epistemology|epistemic]] justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a ''[[sui generis]]'' existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If we fail to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'"&lt;ref name=Sober2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sober |first=Elliott |year=2004 |title=Simplicity, Inference and Modeling: Keeping it Sophisticatedly Simple |editor1-first=Arnold |editor1-last=Zellner |editor2-first=Hugo A. |editor2-last=Keuzenkamp |editor2-link=Hugo A.

==== Richard Swinburne ====

[[Richard Swinburne]] argues for simplicity on logical grounds:

{{quote|... the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that its predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other available hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate ''a priori'' epistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth.|Swinburne 1997}}

According to Swinburne, since our choice of theory cannot be determined by data (see [[Underdetermination]] and [[Duhem-Quine thesis]]), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use. Since it is absurd to have no logical method for settling on one hypothesis amongst an infinite number of equally data-compliant hypotheses, we should choose the simplest theory: "Either science is irrational [in the way it judges theories and predictions probable] or the principle of simplicity is a fundamental synthetic a priori truth." (Swinburne 1997).

==== Ludwig Wittgenstein ====
From the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'':

* 3.328 "If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor."
: (If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)
* 4.04 "In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models)."
* 5.47321 "Occam's Razor is, of course, not an arbitrary rule nor one justified by its practical success. It simply says that unnecessary elements in a symbolism mean nothing. Signs which serve one purpose are logically equivalent; signs which serve no purpose are logically meaningless."

and on the related concept of "simplicity":

* 6.363 "The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences."

=== Science and the scientific method ===
[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Andreas Cellarius]]'s illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'' (1660). Future positions of the sun, moon and other solar system bodies can be calculated using a [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model (the earth is at the centre) or using a [[Heliocentrism#The view of modern science|heliocentric model]] (the sun is at the centre). Both work, but the geocentric model arrives at the same conclusions through a much more complex system of calculations than the heliocentric model. This was pointed out in a preface to [[Copernicus]]' first edition of ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.]]
In [[science]], Occam's razor is used as a [[heuristic]] to guide scientists in developing theoretical models rather than as an arbiter between published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In [[physics]], parsimony was an important heuristic in [[Albert Einstein]]'s formulation of [[special relativity]],&lt;ref name="fn_(102)"&gt;{{cite journal |language=German |first=Albert |last=Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content? |journal=Annalen der Physik |pages=639–41 |year=1905 |issue=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(103)"&gt;L.

In [[chemistry]], Occam's razor is often an important heuristic when developing a model of a [[reaction mechanism]].&lt;ref name="fn_(107)"&gt;RA Jackson, Mechanism: An Introduction to the Study of Organic Reactions, Clarendon, Oxford, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(108)"&gt;Carpenter, B. K. (1984). ''Determination of Organic Reaction Mechanism'', New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is useful as a heuristic in developing models of reaction mechanisms, it has been shown to fail as a criterion for selecting among some selected published models.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt; In this context, Einstein himself expressed caution when he formulated Einstein's Constraint: "It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience".&lt;!-- ref: "On the Method of Theoretical Physics" The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933); also published in ''Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (April 1934), pp. 163–169., p. 165. --&gt; An often-quoted version of this constraint (which cannot be verified as posited by Einstein himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|title=Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529075018/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "Everything should be kept as simple as possible, but not simpler."

In the scientific method, parsimony is an [[epistemological]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[heuristic]] preference, not an irrefutable principle of [[logic]] or a scientific result.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt; As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation that is consistent with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available.&lt;ref name="fn_(100)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

When scientists use the idea of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may have nothing to do with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="fn_(114)" /&gt;

It has been suggested that Occam's razor is a widely accepted example of extraevidential consideration, even though it is entirely a metaphysical assumption. There is little [[empirical evidence]] that the world is actually simple or that simple accounts are more likely to be true than complex ones.&lt;ref name="fn_(120)"&gt;{{cite journal |date=4 February 1994 |author1=Naomi Oreskes |author2=Kristin Shrader-Frechette |author3=Kenneth Belitz |title=Verification, Validation, and Confirmation of Numerical Models in the Earth Sciences |journal=Science |volume=263 |pages=641–646 |url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see note 25 |issue=5147 |bibcode=1994Sci...263..641O |doi=10.1126/science.263.5147.641 |pmid=17747657 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502042408/http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/papers/Oreskes1.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, Occam's razor is a conservative tool, cutting out "crazy, complicated constructions" and assuring "that hypotheses are grounded in the science of the day", thus yielding "normal" science: models of explanation and prediction.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)" /&gt; There are, however, notable exceptions where Occam's razor turns a conservative scientist into a reluctant revolutionary. For example, [[Max Planck]] interpolated between the [[Wien approximation|Wien]] and [[Rayleigh–Jeans law|Jeans]] radiation laws and used Occam's razor logic to formulate the quantum hypothesis, even resisting that hypothesis as it became more obvious that it was correct.&lt;ref name="fn_(101)"/&gt;

Appeals to simplicity were used to argue against the phenomena of meteorites, [[ball lightning]], [[continental drift]], and [[reverse transcriptase]]{{fact|date=August 2018}}. One can argue for atomic building blocks for matter, because it provides a simpler explanation for the observed reversibility of both mixing and chemical reactions as simple separation and rearrangements of atomic building blocks. At the time, however, the [[atomic theory]] was considered more complex because it implied the existence of invisible particles that had not been directly detected. [[Ernst Mach]] and the logical positivists rejected [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]] until the reality of atoms was more evident in [[Brownian motion]], as shown by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=Pojman2009&gt;{{cite book |year=2009 |author=Paul Pojman |chapter=Ernst Mach |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ernst-mach/ |place=California |publisher=Stanford University |issn=1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, postulating the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] is more complex than transmission of light through a [[vacuum]]. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a physical medium, and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as [[wave–particle duality|light behaves like waves and like particles]].

Three axioms presupposed by the scientific method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact that they have not been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

There are examples where Occam's razor would have favored the wrong theory given the available data. Simplicity principles are useful philosophical preferences for choosing a more likely theory from among several possibilities that are all consistent with available data. A single instance of Occam's razor favoring a wrong theory falsifies the razor as a general principle.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt; Michael Lee and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = M.

If multiple models of natural law make exactly the same testable predictions, they are equivalent and there is no need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same testable predictions.&lt;ref name="fn_(110)"/&gt;

=== Biology ===
Biologists or philosophers of biology use Occam's razor in either of two contexts both in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]]: the units of selection controversy and [[systematics]]. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in his book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966) argues that the best way to explain [[altruism]] among animals is based on low-level (i.e., individual) selection as opposed to high-level group selection. Altruism is defined by some evolutionary biologists (e.g., R. Alexander, 1987; W. D. Hamilton, 1964) as behavior that is beneficial to others (or to the group) at a cost to the individual, and many posit individual selection as the mechanism that explains altruism solely in terms of the behaviors of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest (or in the interest of their genes, via kin selection). Williams was arguing against the perspective of others who propose selection at the level of the group as an evolutionary mechanism that selects for altruistic traits (e.g., D. S. Wilson &amp; E. O. Wilson, 2007). The basis for Williams' contention is that of the two, individual selection is the more parsimonious theory. In doing so he is invoking a variant of Occam's razor known as [[Morgan's Canon]]: "In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development." (Morgan 1903).

However, more recent biological analyses, such as [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', have contended that Morgan's Canon is not the simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and this is really the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as [[Emergent evolution|emergent]] features of evolution.

[[Zoology]] provides an example. [[Muskox]]en, when threatened by [[Gray wolf|wolves]], form a circle with the males on the outside and the females and young on the inside. This is an example of a behavior by the males that seems to be altruistic. The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the group as a whole and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.  Another interpretation is kin selection: if the males are protecting their offspring, they are protecting copies of their own alleles.  Engaging in this behavior would be favored by individual selection if the cost to the male musk ox is less than half of the benefit received by his calf – which could easily be the case if wolves have an easier time killing calves than adult males.  It could also be the case that male musk oxen would be individually less likely to be killed by wolves if they stood in a circle with their horns pointing out, regardless of whether they were protecting the females and offspring.  That would be an example of regular natural selection – a phenomenon called "the selfish herd".

[[Systematics]] is the branch of [[biology]] that attempts to establish patterns of genealogical relationship among biological taxa. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics: cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that [[genealogy]] alone should determine classification, pheneticists contend that overall similarity is the determining criterion, while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sober|first1=Elliot|title=Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference|date=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-69144-2|page=7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is among the cladists that Occam's razor is to be found, although their term for it is ''cladistic parsimony''. Cladistic parsimony (or [[maximum parsimony]]) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of [[phylogenetic trees]] (more specifically, cladograms). [[Cladistics|Cladograms]] are branching, tree-like structures used to represent hypotheses of relative degree of relationship, based on shared, derived character states. Cladistic parsimony is used to select as the preferred hypothesis of relationships the cladogram that requires the fewest implied character state transformations. Critics of the cladistic approach often observe that for some types of tree, parsimony consistently produces the wrong results, regardless of how much data is collected (this is called statistical inconsistency, or [[long branch attraction]]). However, this criticism is also potentially true for any type of phylogenetic inference, unless the model used to estimate the tree reflects the way that evolution actually happened.  Because this information is not empirically accessible, the criticism of statistical inconsistency against parsimony holds no force.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, AVZ. 2017.  Statistical consistency and phylogenetic inference: a brief review.  Cladistics. (early view:  {{DOI|10.1111/cla.12216}})&lt;/ref&gt;  For a book-length treatment of cladistic parsimony, see [[Elliott Sober]]'s ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference'' (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam's razor in biology, see Sober's article "Let's Razor Ockham's Razor" (1990).

Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. [[Likelihood function|Likelihood]] methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ [[information theory]], a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam's razor in the same way.

[[Francis Crick]] has commented on potential limitations of Occam's razor in biology. He advances the argument that because biological systems are the products of (an ongoing) natural selection, the mechanisms are not necessarily optimal in an obvious sense. He cautions: "While Ockham's razor is a useful tool in the physical sciences, it can be a very dangerous implement in biology. It is thus very rash to use simplicity and elegance as a guide in biological research."&lt;ref&gt;Crick 1988, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], parsimony is used to infer ancient [[Historical migration|migrations]] of [[species]] or [[population]]s by observing the geographic distribution and relationships of existing [[organism]]s. Given the phylogenetic tree, ancestral migrations are inferred to be those that require the minimum amount of total movement.

=== Religion ===
{{Main| Existence of God}}

In the [[philosophy of religion]], Occam's razor is sometimes applied to the [[existence of God]]. [[William of Ockham]] himself was a Christian. He believed in God, and in the authority of Scripture; he writes that "nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/ |publisher=Stanford |title=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |contribution=William Ockham |accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ockham believed that an explanation has no sufficient basis in reality when it does not harmonize with reason, experience, or the Bible. However, unlike many theologians of his time, Ockham did not believe God could be logically proven with arguments. To Ockham, science was a matter of discovery, but theology was a matter of [[revelation]] and [[faith]]. He states: "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T Irvin &amp; Scott W Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement Volume, I: Earliest Christianity to 1453'', p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', uses a formulation of Occam's razor to construct an objection to the idea that God exists, which he refutes directly with a counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In turn, Aquinas answers this with the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and addresses the particular objection above with the following answer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than argue for the necessity of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], who viewed belief in God as a [[leap of faith]] that sometimes directly opposed reason.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the doctrine of [[Gordon Clark]]'s [[presuppositional apologetics]], with the exception that Clark never thought the leap of faith was contrary to reason (see also [[Fideism]]).

Various [[Arguments for the existence of God|arguments in favor of God]] establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some anti-theists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]]).

Another application of the principle is to be found in the work of [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753). Berkeley was an idealist who believed that all of reality could be explained in terms of the mind alone. He invoked Occam's razor against [[materialism]], stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable. One potential problem with this belief is that it's possible, given Berkeley's position, to find [[Solipsism|solipsism]] itself more in line with the razor than a God-mediated world beyond a single thinker.

Occam's razor may also be recognized in the apocryphal story about an exchange between [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Napoleon]]. It is said that in praising Laplace for one of his recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of [[Lagrange]], appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;p. 282, [https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ ''Mémoires du docteur F. Antommarchi, ou les derniers momens de Napoléon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514072842/https://books.google.com/books?id=88xZAAAAcAAJ |date=14 May 2016 }}, vol. 1, 1825, Paris: Barrois L'Ainé&lt;/ref&gt; Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's [[atheism]], more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of [[methodological naturalism]], or even simply that the fewer [[premise|logical premises]] one assumes, the [[List of mathematical jargon#strong|stronger]] is one's conclusion.

In his article "Sensations and Brain Processes" (1959), [[J. J. C. Smart]] invoked Occam's razor with the aim to justify his preference of the mind-brain identity theory over [[mind-body dualism|spirit-body dualism]]. Dualists state that there are two kinds of substances in the universe: physical (including the body) and spiritual, which is non-physical. In contrast, identity theorists state that everything is physical, including consciousness, and that there is nothing nonphysical. Though it is impossible to appreciate the spiritual when limiting oneself to the physical, Smart maintained that identity theory explains all phenomena by assuming only a physical reality. Subsequently, Smart has been severely criticized for his use (or misuse) of Occam's razor and ultimately retracted his advocacy of it in this context. [[Paul Churchland]] (1984) states that by itself Occam's razor is inconclusive regarding duality. In a similar way, Dale Jacquette (1994) stated that Occam's razor has been used in attempts to justify eliminativism and reductionism in the philosophy of mind. Eliminativism is the thesis that the ontology of [[folk psychology]] including such entities as "pain", "joy", "desire", "fear", etc., are eliminable in favor of an ontology of a completed neuroscience.

=== Penal ethics ===
In penal theory and the philosophy of punishment, parsimony refers specifically to taking care in the distribution of [[punishment]] in order to avoid excessive punishment. In the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach to the philosophy of punishment, [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "parsimony principle" states that any punishment greater than is required to achieve its end is unjust. The concept is related but not identical to the legal concept of [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. Parsimony is a key consideration of the modern [[restorative justice]], and is a component of utilitarian approaches to punishment, as well as the [[prison abolition movement]]. Bentham believed that true parsimony would require punishment to be individualised to take account of the [[sensibility]] of the individual—an individual more sensitive to punishment should be given a proportionately lesser one, since otherwise needless pain would be inflicted. Later utilitarian writers have tended to abandon this idea, in large part due to the impracticality of determining each alleged criminal's relative sensitivity to specific punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tonry | first1 = Michael | year = 2005 | title =  Obsolescence and Immanence in Penal Theory and Policy | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623074821/http://www.columbialawreview.org/pdf/Tonry-Web.pdf | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 1233–1275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability theory and statistics ===
Marcus Hutter's universal artificial intelligence builds upon [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|Solomonoff's mathematical formalization of the razor]] to calculate the expected value of an action.

There are various papers in scholarly journals deriving formal versions of Occam's razor from probability theory, applying it in [[statistical inference]], and using it to come up with criteria for penalizing complexity in statistical inference. Papers&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David M. Boulton; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 11, Issue 2, 1968 Page(s):185–194, "An information measure for classification."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Chris S. Wallace and David L. Dowe; ''Computer Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 4, Sep 1999 Page(s):270–283, "Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested a connection between Occam's razor and [[Kolmogorov complexity]].&lt;ref name="Volker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|title=A short introduction to Model Selection, Kolmogorov Complexity and Minimum Description Length|last=Nannen|first=Volker|accessdate=2010-07-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602044851/http://volker.nannen.com/pdf/short_introduction_to_model_selection.pdf|archivedate=2 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems with the original formulation of the razor is that it only applies to models with the same explanatory power (i.e., it only tells us to prefer the simplest of equally good models). A more general form of the razor can be derived from Bayesian model comparison, which is based on [[Bayes factor]]s and can be used to compare models that don't fit the observations equally well. These methods can sometimes optimally balance the complexity and power of a model. Generally, the exact Occam factor is intractable, but approximations such as [[Akaike information criterion]], [[Bayesian information criterion]], [[Variational Bayesian methods]], [[false discovery rate]], and [[Laplace's method]] are used. Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers are now employing such techniques, for instance through work on [[Occam Learning]] or more generally on the [[Free energy principle]].

Statistical versions of Occam's razor have a more rigorous formulation than what philosophical discussions produce. In particular, they must have a specific definition of the term ''simplicity'', and that definition can vary. For example, in the [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] [[minimum description length]] approach, the subject must pick a [[Turing machine]] whose operations describe the basic operations ''believed'' to represent "simplicity" by the subject. However, one could always choose a Turing machine with a simple operation that happened to construct one's entire theory and would hence score highly under the razor. This has led to two opposing camps: one that believes Occam's razor is objective, and one that believes it is subjective.

==== Objective razor ====
The minimum instruction set of a [[universal Turing machine]] requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of most practical theories. [[Marcus Hutter]] has used this consistency to define a "natural" Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex instruction sets in the formulation of razors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|title=Algorithmic Information Theory|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224043538/http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm|archivedate=24 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the program for the universal program as the "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] that "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized."&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. B. Vitányi and Ming Li; ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'', Volume 46, Issue 2, Mar 2000 Page(s):446–464, "Minimum Description Length Induction, Bayesianism and Kolmogorov Complexity."&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the [[minimum message length]] (MML) principle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One possible conclusion from mixing the concepts of Kolmogorov complexity and Occam's razor is that an ideal data compressor would also be a scientific explanation/formulation generator. Some attempts have been made to re-derive known laws from considerations of simplicity or compressibility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/0001020|title= Why Occam's Razor|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|volume=17|issue=3|pages=255–266|last1=Standish|first1=Russell K|year=2000|doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000032475.18334.0e|bibcode=2004FoPhL..17..255S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the appropriate mathematical theory of Occam's razor already exists, namely, [[Ray Solomonoff|Solomonoff's]] [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of optimal inductive inference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomonoff | first1 = Ray | authorlink = Ray Solomonoff | year = 1964 | title = A formal theory of inductive inference.

== Controversial aspects of the razor ==
Occam's razor is not an embargo against the positing of any kind of entity, or a recommendation of the simplest theory come what may.{{Refn|"Ockham's razor does not say that the more simple a hypothesis, the better."&lt;ref name=SkepticDict2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert T. Carroll |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter=Occam's Razor |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Last updated 18 February 2012 |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301193834/http://www.skepdic.com/occam.html |archivedate=1 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed "theoretical scrutiny" tests and are equally well-supported by evidence.{{Refn|"Today, we think of the principle of parsimony as a heuristic device. We don't assume that the simpler theory is correct and the more complex one false. We know from experience that more often than not the theory that requires more complicated machinations is wrong. Until proved otherwise, the more complex theory competing with a simpler explanation should be put on the back burner, but not thrown onto the trash heap of history until proven false."&lt;ref name="SkepticDict2012" /&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Furthermore, it may be used to prioritize empirical testing between two equally plausible but unequally testable hypotheses; thereby minimizing costs and wastes while increasing chances of falsification of the simpler-to-test hypothesis.

Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or [[syntax]]), while its [[ontology]] (or [[semantics]]) becomes simpler, or vice versa.{{Refn|"While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions. Postulating extra entities may allow a theory to be formulated more simply, while reducing the ontology of a theory may only be possible at the price of making it syntactically more complex."&lt;ref name="fn_(109)"/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W V O|last=Quine|author-link= W. V. Quine|year=1961|chapter=Two dogmas of empiricism|title= From a logical point of view|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=20–46|isbn=0-674-32351-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galileo Galilei]] lampooned the ''misuse'' of Occam's razor in his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]''. The principle is represented in the dialogue by Simplicio. The telling point that Galileo presented ironically was that if one really wanted to start from a small number of entities, one could always consider the letters of the alphabet as the fundamental entities, since one could construct the whole of human knowledge out of them.

== Anti-razors ==
Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. [[Walter Chatton]] (c. 1290–1343) was a contemporary of William of Ockham (c. 1287–1347) who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own ''anti-razor:'' "If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on." Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution ''Se non è vero, è ben trovato'' ("Even if it is not true, it is well conceived") when referred to a particularly artful explanation.

Anti-razors have also been created by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), and [[Karl Menger]] (1902–1985). Leibniz's version took the form of a [[principle of plenitude]], as [[Arthur Lovejoy]] has called it: the idea being that God created the most varied and populous of possible worlds. Kant felt a need to moderate the effects of Occam's razor and thus created his own counter-razor: "The variety of beings should not rashly be diminished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Critique of Pure Reason|year=1929|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|author=[[Immanuel Kant]]|editor=Norman Kemp-Smith transl|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=92|quote=Entium varietates non temere esse minuendas|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516172030/http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/cpr/toc.html|archivedate=16 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Menger found mathematicians to be too parsimonious with regard to variables, so he formulated his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: "Entities must not be reduced to the point of inadequacy" and "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." A less serious but (some{{Who|date=May 2015}} might say) even more extremist anti-razor is [['Pataphysics]], the "science of imaginary solutions" developed by [[Alfred Jarry]] (1873–1907). Perhaps the ultimate in anti-reductionism, "'Pataphysics seeks no less than to view each event in the universe as completely unique, subject to no laws but its own." Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story/mock-essay "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". There is also [[Crabtree's Bludgeon]], which cynically states that "[n]o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated."

The  '''Tree of Porphyry'''  is a classic device for illustrating what is also called a "scale of being". It was suggested—if not first, then most famously in the European philosophical tradition—by the 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]] Greek [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosopher and logician [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]].&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''scala praedicamentalis''.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] suggests the Porphyrian tree in [[Isagoge|his introduction (in Greek, "''Isagoge''")]] to [[Aristotle]]'s [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. Porphyry presented Aristotle's classification of categories in a way that was later adopted into tree-like diagrams of dichotomous divisions, which indicate that a species is defined by [[genus-differentia|a genus and a differentia]] and that this logical process continues until the lowest species is reached, which can no longer be so defined.  No illustrations or diagrams occur in editions of Porphyry's original work.  But, diagrams were eventually made, and became associated with the scheme that Porphyry describes, following Aristotle.

[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_01_intro.htm Porphyry's ''Isagoge''] was originally written in Greek, but was translated into Latin in the early 6th century CE by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].  Boethius's translation became the standard philosophical logic textbook in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-categories/#WilOckBCa128D134 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] - Medieval Theories of the Categories&lt;/ref&gt;   Until the late 19th century, theories of categories based on Porphyry's work were still being taught to students of [[logic]].

The following very helpful passage by philosopher [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] gives some hint as to the history of the Porphyrian tree:

:In medieval education, the standard introduction to Aristotle's works was via Porphyry's ''Isagoge'', and division entered the educated consciousness in the form of 'Porphyry's Tree'. It is not clear that Porphyry himself, in the relevant passage,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "Porphyry, ''Isagoge'', trans. E. W. Warren (Toronto:  Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1975), 34."&lt;/ref&gt; went any further than Aristotle in recommending division. But his brief comment was developed into the Tree by medieval logicians. It appears in [[William of Sherwood|William of Sherwood's]] ''Introduction to Logic'' and is given the name '''arbor Porphyrii''' in the most popular medieval logic, [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Summulae Logicales''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "[[Norman Kretzmann|N. Kretzmann]], ''William of Sherwood's Introduction to Logic'' (Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 54; Peter of Spain, ''Summulae Logicales'', [[Józef Maria Bocheński|I. M. Boche&amp;#324;ski]] (ed.) (Turin:  Marietti, 1947), 17-18."&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnaeus's system of static and discrete species was simply the result of filling in the abstract Tree with the names of actual species.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.  The passage quoted here is from pp. 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the notion of the Porphyrian tree as an actual diagram comes later than Porphyry himself.  Still, scholars do speak of Porphyry's tree as in the ''Isagoge'' and they mean by this only that the idea of dividing genera into species via differentiae is found in the ''Isagoge''.  But, of course, Porphyry was only following what was already in Aristotle, and Aristotle was following what was already in his teacher, [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;A number of Plato's dialogs contain the idea of division in them:  see [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], [[Philebus]], [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]], [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] (book VII), and [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] for starters.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The following Porphyrian tree consists of three columns of words; the middlemost (in boldface) contains the series of [[Genus|genera]] and [[species]], and we can take as analogous to the trunk of a tree. The extremes (the terms that jut out to the left and right), containing the [[differentia]]e, we can take as analogous to the branches of a tree:

[[File:Porphyrian Tree.png|frameless|center|400px|This image is an illustration of the notion of a Porphyrian Tree as it comes down to us today through the European philosophical and logical tradition.]]

The diagram shows the highest genus to be substance.  (Whether substance is a highest genus, really, is not in question here:  right now we are only going to discuss what the diagram shows, not whether what it shows is true or false.)  The technical term for a highest substance is "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/summum_genus ''summum genus'']".  So, substance is the ''summum genus'' as far as this diagram goes.  The diagram shows that the genus substance to have two differentia, namely, "thinking" and "extended".  This indicates that there are two species of the genus substance, thinking substance and extended substance.  The diagram does not give a term for the species of thinking substance (this would be "mind"), but it does give the term for the species of extended substance, namely, body.  That is, body is a species of the genus substance; body is that species of the genus substance that is extended.

Now that we have seen body as a species of substance, we treat body as a genus itself.  As a genus, it has two differentia of its own, inanimate and animate.  So, there are two species of body, inanimate body and animate body.  The diagram does not tell us what the term for inanimate body is, but it indicates a term for animate body, namely, animal.  Animal is an animate species of the genus body.

And, again, now that we have looked at animal as a species of the genus body, we look at animal now as a genus and consider its differentia, which are shown on the diagram to be irrational and rational.  Thus, according to the diagram there are two species of the genus animal, irrational animal and rational animal.  We are not told by the diagram what a term for irrational animal is, but the diagram indicates that a rational animal is a human.  Thus, human is a rational species of the genus animal.

Beneath human, however, there are no further species.  "This" and "that" if they are considered differentiae, are of a special kind that map the species human not onto a new species but onto particular humans.,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of "this" and "that" as universals/differentia, see [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "A. Consciousness", "I. Sense-Certainty:  or the 'this' and 'meaning' [Meinen]", translated by A. V. Miller, Oxford University Press, pp. 58-66.&lt;/ref&gt;   The particular human Plato is named in the diagram.  Plato is not a species (that is why his name is not in bold, unlike the species above).  So, human is the lowest species in this diagram.  The technical name for the lowest species in such a scheme is the "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infima_species ''infima species'']".  So, for this diagram, human is the ''infima species''.

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Positive and Negative Affect Schedule''' ('''PANAS''') is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both [[Positive affectivity|positive]] and [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]]. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 ''(not at all)'' to 5 ''(very much)''. The measure has been used mainly as a research tool in group studies, but can be utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations as well.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=John R.|last2=Henry|first2=Julie D.|title=The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS): Construct validity, measurement properties and normative data in a large non-clinical sample|url=http://doi.crossref.org/10.1348/0144665031752934|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=245–265|doi=10.1348/0144665031752934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened, elongated, and children's versions of the PANAS have been developed, taking approximately 5–10 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Clinical and non-clinical studies have found the PANAS to be a reliable and valid instrument in the assessment of positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Clark|first2=Lee A.|last3=Tellegen|first3=Auke|title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and history ==
The PANAS was developed in 1988 by researchers from the University of Minnesota and Southern Methodist University. Previous mood measures have shown correlations of variable strength between positive and negative affect, and these same measures have questionable reliability and validity. Watson, Clark, and Tellegen developed the PANAS in an attempt to provide a better, purer measure of each of these dimensions.

The researchers extracted 60 terms from the factor analyses of Michael Zevon and Tellegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zevon|first=Michael A.|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke|date=1982-07-01|title=The structure of mood change: An idiographic/nomothetic analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/43/1/111|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=43|issue=1|pages=111–122|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.111|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown to be relatively accurate markers of either positive or negative affect, but not both. They chose terms that met a strong correlation to one corresponding dimension but exhibited a weak correlation to the other. Through multiple rounds of elimination and preliminary analyses with a test population, the researchers arrived at 10 terms for each of the two scales, as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
! scope="col"| Positive affect
! scope="col"| Negative affect
|-
|Attentive
|Hostile

===PANAS-C===
The '''PANAS for Children (PANAS-C)''' was developed in an attempt to differentiate the affective expressions of anxiety and depression in children. The tripartite model on which this measure is based suggests that high levels of negative affect is present in those with anxiety and depression, but high levels of positive affect is not shared between the two. Previous mood scales for children have been shown to reliably capture the former relationship but not the latter; the PANAS-C was created as a tool with better discriminant validity for child assessment. Similar to the development of the original PANAS, the PANAS-C drew from terms of the PANAS-X and eliminated several terms with insufficient correlations between the term and the affective construct after preliminary analyses with a non-clinical sample of children. The final version of the measure consists of 27 items: 12 positive affect terms and 15 negative affect terms. Despite the purpose of its development, however, the measure’s discriminant validity is still wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Alicia A.|last2=Kendall|first2=Philip C.|date=2009-01-14|title=Psychometric Properties of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) in Children with Anxiety Disorders|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=343–352|doi=10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|issn=0009-398X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-SF===
The '''PANAS-SF''',  comprises 10 items that were determined through the highest factor loadings on the exploratory [[factor analysis]] reported by Watson et al. (1988) in his original PANAS. Previous mood scales, such that of Bradburn, had low reliabilities and high correlations between subscales. Watson was able to address these concerns in his study of the original PANAS; however, his participants consisted mostly of student populations. The purpose of the PANAS-SF was not only to provide a shorter and more concise form of the PANAS, but to be able to apply the schedules to older clinical populations. Overall, it was reported that this modified model was consistent with Watson’s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kercher|first=Kyle|date=1992-06-01|title=Assessing Subjective Well-Being in the Old-Old The PANAS as a Measure of Orthogonal Dimensions of Positive and Negative Affect|url=http://roa.sagepub.com/content/14/2/131|journal=Research on Aging|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131–168|doi=10.1177/0164027592142001|issn=0164-0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-PANAS-SF===
Separate from the PANAS-SF,  Edmund Thompson created the international PANAS short form ('''I-PANAS-SF''') in order to make a 10 item mood scale that can be implemented effectively on an international level, provide more clarity on the content of the items, reduce ambiguities, address the limitations of the original and the previous short form of the PANAS, and also to provide a shorter, yet dependable and valid scale. To determine the 10 items of the 20 original items, two focus groups were utilized to evaluate all of the original 20 PANAS items. They found that while some items were easily understood by the participant, certains items had different meanings or were too ambiguous. Items that had too much ambiguity were eliminated from the modified form. Researchers found that the I-PANAS-SF had high correlations with the original PANAS. Through multiple tests and studies, they were able to determine that the I-PANAS-SF was on par with the original scale and can be used as a reliable, valid, brief, and efficient instrument on an international scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Edmund R.|date=2007-03-01|title=Development and Validation of an Internationally Reliable Short-Form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/38/2/227|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-X===
In 1994, Watson and Clark developed an expanded form of the PANAS, called the '''PANAS-X''', that consists of 60 items that can be completed in 10 minutes or less. The PANAS-X incorporates the original, higher order dimensions specified in the PANAS in addition to the measures of 11 lower order emotional states. These measures are broken down into three main categories: basic negative emotion scales consisting of fear, hostility, guilt, and sadness; basic positive emotion scales consisting of joviality, self-assurance, and attentiveness; and other affective states consisting of shyness, fatigue, serenity, and surprise. Through extensive analyses, all eleven affective states, with the exception of surprise, were shown to be stable, valid measures that assess how an individual’s emotional states fluctuate over time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Watson,|last2=Anna|first2=Clark, Lee|date=1999-01-01|title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Many forms of the PANAS (PANAS-C, PANAS-X, I-PANAS-SF, and among others) have shown that the PANAS has been widely employed. Recent studies have also shown that the PANAS can be administered in a large general adult population, as well as other populations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to date, the PANAS is mostly used as a research tool in group studies, but it has the potential to be utilized in clinical work with individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the PANAS has the potential to be used to evaluate mental illnesses, as shown in an experiment conducted by Dyck, Jolly, and Kramer, which demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing between depression and anxiety in clinical samples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

== Limitations ==
Since the PANAS is a self-report questionnaire, it can be difficult to assess people’s mood accurately, as people can overstate or understate their experience of their moods. In addition, the original PANAS had a limited sample size of college students, which concerns with wide applicability to other samples. Furthermore, some studies claim that the PANAS is too long or that its items are redundant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The PANAS does not encompass higher order mood states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''The primary/secondary quality distinction''' is a conceptual distinction in [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]], concerning the nature of [[reality]].  It is most explicitly articulated by [[John Locke]] in his ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', but earlier thinkers such as [[Galileo]] and [[Descartes]] made similar distinctions.

'''Primary qualities''' are thought to be [[properties]] of objects that are independent of any observer, such as [[solid]]ity, [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]], [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[number]] and [[shape|figure]]. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.

'''Secondary qualities''' are thought to be properties that produce [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s in observers, such as [[color]], [[taste]], [[olfaction|smell]], and [[sound]]. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. [[Knowledge]] that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.

Primary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.

==History==

* "By convention there are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention there is color; but in truth there are atoms and the void"
:—Democritus, Fragment 9.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Sextus Empiricus, ''Adversus Mathematicos'' vii 135&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we locate them are concerned, and that they reside in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated"
:—Galileo Galilei, ''The Assayer'' (published 1623).&lt;ref&gt;As reprinted in (Drake, 1957, p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[I]t must certainly be concluded regarding those things which, in external objects, we call by the names of light, color, odor, taste, sound, heat, cold, and of other tactile qualities, [...]; that we are not aware of their being anything other than various arrangements of the size, figure, and motions of the parts of these objects which make it possible for our nerves to move in various ways, and to excite in our soul all the various feelings which they produce there."
:—René Descartes, ''Principles of Philosophy'' (published 1644/1647).&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René.  ''Principles of Philosophy''.  1644/1647.  Trans. Valentine Rodger Miller and Reese P. Miller.  D. Reidel Publishing Company, 1984.  Page 282.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour."
:—Isaac Newton, ''Optics'' (3rd ed. 1721, original in 1704).&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in (Newton, 1953, ed. Chris Jamieson, p. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Leibniz===

[[Leibniz]] was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'' that "[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us."&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W.  ''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XII.  1686.  Trans. George R. Montgomery.  The Open Court Publishing Company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berkeley===

{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}

[[George Berkeley]] wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book [[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that ''there is'' some object.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Georges Dicker, ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, Part III, paragraph 8: "Berkeley's Attack on the Theory of Primary and Secondary Qualities"&lt;/ref&gt; Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any ''content'' to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object.  What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time ''as we experience them''. Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an ''object'' to our ''experiences of space and time''). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an ''idea'' of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.

===Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science]]'', claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In  § 13, Remark II, he wrote: "Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible."

'''''Rationes seminales''''' ([[Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λόγοι σπερματικοὶ'' or ''logoi spermatikoi''), translated variously as germinal or causal principles, primordial reasons, original factors, seminal reasons or virtues, or seedlike principles, is a [[theological]] theory on the origin of species. It is the doctrine that [[God]] created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted ''rationes seminales'', from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.

The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Neoplatonism]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Helmig,''Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition'', Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea was incorporated into [[Christian]] thought through the writings of authors such as  [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Roger Bacon]], until mostly rejected in the modern period. [[Evolution]], though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories (cf "Man incarnate spirit" by Ramon Lucas Lucas). &lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, ''Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought'',  SUNY Press, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''rationes seminales'' was also used as an explanation for [[spontaneous generation]].

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

The '''square of opposition''' is a diagram representing the relations between the four basic [[categorical proposition]]s.
The origin of the square can be traced back to [[Aristotle]] making the distinction between two oppositions: [[contradiction]] and [[contrariety]].
But Aristotle did not draw any diagram. This was done several centuries later by [[Apuleius]] and [[Boethius]].

== Summary ==
In traditional logic, a proposition (Latin: ''propositio'') is a spoken assertion (''oratio enunciativa''), not the meaning of an assertion, as in modern philosophy of language and logic. A ''categorical proposition'' is a simple proposition containing two terms, subject and predicate, in which the predicate is either asserted or denied of the subject.

Every categorical proposition can be reduced to one of four [[logical form]]s. These are:
* The so-called 'A' proposition, the universal affirmative (''universalis affirmativa''), whose form in Latin is 'omne S est P', usually translated as 'every S is a P'.
* The 'E' proposition, the universal negative (''universalis negativa''), Latin form 'nullum S est P', usually translated as 'no S are P'.
* The 'I' proposition, the particular affirmative (''particularis affirmativa''), Latin 'quoddam S est P', usually translated as 'some S are P'.
* The 'O' proposition, the particular negative (''particularis negativa''), Latin 'quoddam S non est P', usually translated as 'some S are not P'.

Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-93078-8|page=150|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so is not a standard form: because it can be either an E or O proposition, it requires a context to determine the form.

Aristotle states (in chapters six and seven of the ''Peri hermaneias'' (Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, Latin ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', English 'On Interpretation')), that there are certain logical relationships between these four kinds of proposition. He says that to every affirmation there corresponds exactly one negation, and that every affirmation and its negation are 'opposed' such that always one of them must be true, and the other false. A pair of affirmative and negative statements he calls a 'contradiction' (in medieval Latin, ''contradictio''). Examples of contradictories are 'every man is white' and 'not every man is white' (also read as 'some men are not white'), 'no man is white' and 'some man is white'.

'Contrary' (medieval: ''contrariae'') statements, are such that both cannot at the same time be true. Examples of these are the universal affirmative 'every man is white', and the universal negative 'no man is white'. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every man is white, since some men are not white. Yet it is also false that no man is white, since there are some white men.

Since every statement has a contradictory opposite, and since a contradictory is true when its opposite is false, it follows that the opposites of contraries (which the medievals called subcontraries, ''subcontrariae'') can both be true, but they cannot both be false. Since subcontraries are negations of universal statements, they were called 'particular' statements by the medieval logicians.

Another logical opposition implied by this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (''alternatio''), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal statement of the same quality such that the particular is implied by the other.  The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every man is white' is true, its contrary 'no man is white' is false. Therefore, the contradictory 'some man is white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no man is white' implies the particular 'not every man is white'.&lt;ref&gt;Parry &amp; Hacker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Sg84H6B-m4C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Aristotelian Logic]'' (SUNY Press, 1990), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen &amp; Nagel, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=U09MjwDSZ0kC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Logic]'' Second Edition (Hackett Publishing, 1993), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary:
* Universal statements are contraries: 'every man is just' and 'no man is just' cannot be true together, although one may be true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one man is just, and at least one man is not just).
* Particular statements are subcontraries. 'Some man is just' and 'some man is not just' cannot be false together.
* The particular statement of one quality is the subaltern of the universal statement of that same quality, which is the superaltern of the particular statement because in Aristotelian semantics 'every A is B' implies 'some A is B' and 'no A is B' implies 'some A is not B'. Note that modern formal interpretations of English sentences interpret 'every A is B' as 'for any x, x is A implies x is B', which does ''not'' imply 'some x is A'. This is a matter of semantic interpretation, however, and does not mean, as is sometimes claimed, that Aristotelian logic is 'wrong'.
* The universal affirmative and the particular negative are contradictories. If some A is not B, not every A is B. Conversely, though this is not the case in modern semantics, it was thought that if every A is not B, some A is not B. This interpretation has caused difficulties (see below). While Aristotle's Greek does not represent the particular negative as 'some A is not B', but as 'not every A is B', someone in his commentary on the ''Peri hermaneias'', renders the particular negative as 'quoddam A non est B', literally 'a certain A is not a B', and in all medieval writing on logic it is customary to represent the particular proposition in this way.

These relationships became the basis of a diagram originating with Boethius and used by medieval logicians to classify the logical relationships. The propositions are placed in the four corners of a square, and the relations represented as lines drawn between them, whence the name 'The Square of Opposition'.

== The problem of [[existential import]] ==
Subcontraries, which medieval logicians represented in the form 'quoddam A est B' (some particular A is B) and 'quoddam A non est B' (some particular A is not B) cannot both be false, since their universal contradictory statements (every A is B / no A is B) cannot both be true. This leads to a difficulty that was first identified by [[Peter Abelard]]. 'Some A is B' seems to imply 'something is A'. For example, 'Some man is white' seems to imply that at least one thing is a man, namely the man who has to be white, if 'some man is white' is true. But, 'some man is not white' also implies that something is a man, namely the man who is not white, if the statement 'some man is not white' is true. But Aristotelian logic requires that necessarily one of these statements is true. Both cannot be false. Therefore, (since both imply that something is a man) it follows that necessarily something is a man, i.e. men exist. But (as Abelard points out, in the Dialectica) surely men might not exist?&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dialectica'', and in his commentary on the ''Perihermaneias''&lt;/ref&gt;

: For with absolutely no man existing, neither the proposition 'every man is a man' is true nor 'some man is not a man'.&lt;ref&gt;''Re enim hominis prorsus non existente neque ea vera est quae ait: omnis homo est homo, nec ea quae proponit: quidam homo non est homo''&lt;/ref&gt;

Abelard also points out that subcontraries containing subject terms denoting nothing, such as 'a man who is a stone', are both false.

: If 'every stone-man is a stone' is true, also its conversion ''per accidens'' is true ('some stones are stone-men'). But no stone is a stone-man, because neither this man nor that man etc. is a stone. But also this 'a certain stone-man is not a stone' is false by necessity, since it is impossible to suppose it is true.&lt;ref&gt;''Si enim vera est: Omnis homo qui lapis est, est lapis, et eius conversa per accidens vera est: Quidam lapis est homo qui est lapis. Sed nullus lapis est homo qui est lapis, quia neque hic neque ille etc. Sed et illam: Quidam homo qui est lapis, non est lapis, falsam esse necesse est, cum impossibile ponat''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terence Parsons]] argues that ancient philosophers did not experience the problem of existential import as only the A and I forms had existential import.

: Affirmatives have existential import, and negatives do not. The ancients thus did not see the incoherence of the square as formulated by [[Aristotle]] because there was no incoherence to see.&lt;ref&gt;in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/#AriForOFor ''The Traditional Square of Opposition''] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

He goes on to cite medieval philosopher [[William of Moerbeke]]
:In affirmative propositions a term is always asserted to supposit for something. Thus, if it supposits for nothing the proposition is false. However, in negative propositions the assertion is either that the term does not supposit for something or that it supposits for something of which the predicate is truly denied. Thus a negative proposition has two causes of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/notes.html#6 (SL I.72) Loux 1974, 206]&lt;/ref&gt;

And points to [[Boethius]]' translation of Aristotle's work as giving rise to the mistaken notion that the O form has existential import.

:But when Boethius comments on this text he illustrates Aristotle's doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and he uses the wording 'Some man is not just'.  So this must have seemed to him to be a natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in English, but he wasn't bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/#RewOFor ''The Traditional Square of Opposition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern squares of opposition==
[[Image:Frege-gegensätze.png|thumb|200px|Frege's square of opposition&lt;br&gt; The ''conträr'' below is an erratum:&lt;br&gt; It should read ''subconträr'']]
In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] argued for requiring existential import on both terms in particular claims (I and O), but allowing all terms of universal claims (A and E) to lack existential import. This decision made [[Venn diagram]]s particularly easy to use for term logic. The square of opposition, under this Boolean set of assumptions, is often called the modern Square of opposition. In the modern square of opposition, A and O claims are contradictories, as are E and I, but all other forms of opposition cease to hold; there are no contraries, subcontraries, or subalterns. Thus, from a modern point of view, it often makes sense to talk about 'the' opposition of a claim, rather than insisting as older logicians did that a claim has several different opposites, which are in different kinds of opposition with the claim.

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' also presents a square of oppositions, organised in an almost identical manner to the classical square, showing the contradictories, subalternates and contraries between four formulae constructed from universal quantification, negation and implication.

[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]]' [[semiotic square]] was derived from Aristotle's work.

The traditional square of opposition is now often compared with squares based on inner- and outer-negation &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.165900.1391710462!/menu/standard/file/2012%20Squares.pdf Westerståhl, 'Classical vs. modern squares of opposition, and beyond'],  in Beziau and Payette (eds.), The Square of Opposition: A General Framework for Cognition, Peter Lang, Bern, 195-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logical hexagons and other bi-simplexes ==
{{Main|Logical hexagon}}

The square of opposition has been extended to a logical hexagon which includes the relationships of six statements. It was discovered independently by both [[Augustin Sesmat]] and [[Robert Blanché]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alessiomoretti.perso.sfr.fr/NOTLogicalHexagon.html N-Opposition Theory ''Logical hexagon'']&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proven that both the square and the hexagon, followed by a "[[logical cube]]", belong to a regular series of n-dimensional objects called "logical bi-simplexes of dimension n." The pattern also goes even beyond this.&lt;ref&gt;Moretti, Pellissier&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Square of opposition (or logical square) and modal logic  ==

The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of [[Apuleius]] has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is bad, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is bad (or Some men are not bad), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are bad, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is bad, the universal negative on the other. [[Robert Blanché]] published with Vrin his Structures intellectuelles in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the [[logical hexagon]] which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language.

[[File:Blank stop sign octagon.svg|thumb|upright|A red [[octagon]] symbolizes "stop" even without the word.|alt=Silhouette of a red octagon]]

A '''symbol''' is a mark, sign  or word that indicates, signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship. Symbols allow people to go beyond what is [[know]]n or seen by creating linkages between otherwise very different concepts and experiences. All communication (and data processing) is achieved through the use of symbols. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs. For example, a red octagon may be a symbol for "STOP". On a map, a blue line might represent a river. [[Numeral system|Numerals]] are symbols for [[number]]s. [[Alphabet]]ic letters may be symbols for sounds. Personal names are symbols representing individuals. A red rose may symbolize love and compassion. The [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] 'x', in a mathematical equation, may symbolize the position of a particle in space.

In [[cartography]], an organized collection of symbols forms a [[Legend (map)#Map symbology|legend]] for a map.

==Etymology==
The word ''symbol'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σύμβολον ''symbolon'', meaning "token,  watchword" from σύν ''syn'' "together" and βάλλω ''bállō'' " "I throw, put." The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" was first recorded in 1590, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=symbol&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In considering the effect of a symbol on the psyche, in his seminal essay ''The Symbol without Meaning'' [[Joseph Campbell]] proposes the following definition:
''A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|title=Flight of the Wild Gander:- The Symbol without Meaning|year=2002|publisher=New World Library|location=California|isbn=1-57731-210-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, expanding on what he means by this definition Campbell says:

:"a symbol, like everything else, shows a double aspect. We must distinguish, therefore between the 'sense' and the 'meaning' of the symbol. It seems to me perfectly clear that all the great and little symbolical systems of the past functioned simultaneously on three levels: the corporeal of waking consciousness, the spiritual of dream, and the ineffable of the absolutely unknowable. The term 'meaning' can refer only to the first two but these, today, are in the charge of science – which is the province as we have said, not of symbols but of signs. The ineffable, the absolutely unknowable, can be only sensed. It is the province of art which is not 'expression' merely, or even primarily, but a quest for, and formulation of, experience evoking, energy-waking images: yielding what [[Sir Herbert Read]] has aptly termed a 'sensuous apprehension of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Symbol without Meaning p153''&lt;/ref&gt;
Jared Elisha defined symbolism that is something that stands for another, it can be place, object, or a person

[[Heinrich Zimmer]] gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.

:"Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Heinrich Zimmer; edited by Joseph|title=Philosophies of India|year=1969|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-01758-1|pages=1–2|edition=9. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Signs and Symbols, ''it is stated that ''A symbol ... is a visual image or sign representing an idea -- a deeper indicator of a universal truth.''&lt;ref&gt;Dorling Kindersley Limited. Signs and Symbols. p.6. {{ISBN|978-0-7566-3393-6}}. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref name= "Womack"&gt;Womack, Mari. Symbols and Meaning: A Concise Introduction. California: AltaMira Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This separates symbols from [[sign]]s, as signs have only one meaning.

Human cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture.  Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one’s cultural background; in other words, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.&lt;ref name="Womack" /&gt;

Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, Susanne K.  A Theory of Art, Developed From: Philosophy in a New Key. New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments.&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;Palczewski, Catherine, and Ice, Richard, and Fritch, John. Rhetoric in Civic Life. Pennsylvania: Strata Publishing, Inc., 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them, but also to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] and cooperate in society through [[constitutive rhetoric]].

==Symbols and semiotics==

[[Semiotics]] is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues.  Semiotics is linked with both [[linguistics]] and psychology.  Semioticians thus not only study what a symbol implies, but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society.  Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both [[denotation]] and [[connotation]].

==Psychoanalysis, rhetoric and archetypes==
Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]], who studied [[archetype]]s, proposed an alternative definition of symbol, distinguishing it from the term ''[[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]''. In Jung's view, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted this with ''symbol'', which he used to stand for something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise.  An example of a symbol in this sense is [[Christ]] as a symbol of the [[archetype]] called ''[[Self in Jungian psychology|self]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Christ, A symbol of the self CW vol 9i Aion RKP 1958&lt;/ref&gt; For example, written languages are composed of a variety of different symbols that create words, p. . Through these written words humans communicate with each other. [[Kenneth Burke]] described ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a "[[Definition of man|symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal]]" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of "blubber" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of "blubber" was created by the man through various kinds of [[learning]].

Burke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the [[The Interpretation of Dreams|theory of dreams]] but also to "normal symbol systems". He says they'''{{clarify|date=December 2013}}'''&lt;!--What is "they"?--&gt; are related through "substitution", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--The meaning of what?--&gt;. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information{{clarify|date=December 2013}}&lt;!--This is still not clear.  These last two sentences do not clearly support or explain the one before it--&gt;.

[[Jean Dalby Clift]] says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls "core images" of the person.  She argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Dalby Clift, ''Core Images of the Self: A Symbolic Approach to Healing and Wholeness''.  Crossroad, 1992. {{page needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfil psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as "the hero," "the princess" and "the witch" have remained popular for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130629202403/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6039-7 Indick, William. Ancient Symbology in Fantasy Literature: A Psychological Study. Jefferson: McFarland &amp;, 2012. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paul Tillich==

[[Paul Tillich]] argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities.  For Tillich a symbol always "points beyond itself" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the "depth dimension of reality itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.
When a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the "symbol is taken for reality." The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality which are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theology of Culture|last = Tillich|first = Paul|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1964|isbn = 0195007115|location = |pages = 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of context in symbolism==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
A symbol's [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] may be modified by various factors including popular usage, [[history]], and contextual [[intent (law)|intent]].

===Historical meaning===
The history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to [[false etymologies]].

===Context===
The context of a symbol may change its meaning.  Similar five-pointed stars might signify a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officer or a member of the [[armed services]], depending upon the [[uniform]].

== Symbols in Cartography ==
[[File:Cartographic Symbols.jpg|thumb|The three categories of cartographic symbol shapes.]]
Symbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles of map design |last=Tyner |first=Judith A. |date=2010|publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=9781606235447 |location=New York |oclc=437300476}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cartography : thematic map design |last=Dent |first=Borden D. |last2=Torguson |first2=Jeffrey |last3=Hodler |first3=T. W. |isbn=0072943823 |edition=6th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |oclc=184827987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, or shape, of a cartographic symbol is classified into one of three main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=How maps work : representation, visualization, and design |last=MacEachren |first=Alan M. |date=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=0898625890 |location=New York |oclc=31078855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial/Representational''' - a shape or image that clearly resembles the geographic feature being symbolized and can be interpreted without a legend.

'''Associative''' - a mixture of pictorial and geometric elements that produce an easily recognizable shape.

'''Abstract/Geometric''' - completely arbitrary shapes chosen to represent a certain feature.

==Symbolic action==
A '''symbolic action''' is an action that has no, or little, practical effect but symbolizes, or signals, what the actor wants or believes.  The action conveys meaning to the viewers.

Symbolic action may overlap with [[symbolic speech]], such as the use of [[flag burning]] to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism.&lt;ref name="Bagossy2008"&gt;Bagossy, Renate. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LyziXxw238C&amp;pg=PA16 The Difficulty of the Amendment Process of the Constitution of the United States of America and Freedom of Speech and its limits]''. GRIN Verlag; 2008-08-11 [cited 5 November 2012]. {{ISBN|9783640129546}}. p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.&lt;ref name="Bednar2008"&gt;Bednar, Michael Kay. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fyefq5LV8sC How Symbolic Action Affects the Media as a Governance Mechanism]''. ProQuest; 2008. {{ISBN|9780549738817}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic actions are sometimes derided as [[slacktivism]].

Besides object types, the terminology model allows defining hierarchical classifications, definitions for object type and [[property]] behavior and definition of casual relations.

The terminology model is a means for subject matter experts to express their knowledge about the subject in subject specific terms. Since the terminology model is structured rather similar to an [[object-oriented]] database schema, is can be transformed without loss of information into an object-oriented [[database schema]]. Thus, the terminology model is a method for problem analysis on the one side and a mean of defining database schema on the other side.

Several terminology models have been developed and published in the field of statistics:

'''Threatcasting''' is a conceptual framework used to help multidisciplinary groups envision future scenarios. It is also a process that enables systematic planning against threats ten years in the future. Utilizing the threatcasting process, groups explore possible future threats and how to transform the future they desire into reality while avoiding undesired futures. Threatcasting is a continuous, multiple-step process with inputs from social science, technical research, cultural history, economics, trends, expert interviews, and science fiction storytelling. These inputs inform the exploration of potential visions of the future.

Once inputs are explored for impact and application, participants create a science fiction story ([[Science fiction prototyping|Science Fiction Prototyping]]) based ten years in the future to add context around human activity. Science Fiction Prototyping consists of a future story about a person in a place doing a thing. The threatcasting process results in creation of many potential futures scenarios - some futures are desirable while others are not. Identifying both types of futures (desirable and undesirable) will help the participant recognize which future to aim toward, and which to avoid. Utilizing the scenarios, participants plot actions necessary in the present and at various intervals working toward the ten year future scenario. These actions will help participants understand how to empower or disrupt the target future scenario. Flags (warning events) are also determined in order to map societal indicators onto the recommended path toward the targeted future. When identified flags appear in society, threatcasting participants map these back to the original forecast to see whether or not they are on track toward the target future scenario.

== Origins ==
{{see also|Science fiction prototyping}}

The notion of threatcasting can be traced back to Brian David Johnson, an applied futurist, who first began using threatcasting, also referred to as futurecasting, in 2011 and to George Hemingway of the Stratalis Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/MMStratalisFuturecasting1.pdf|title=Futurecasting the Mining Industry|last=|first=|date=January 2013|website=Stratalis Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who pioneered notion of futurecasting for corporate strategy and innovation industrial markets, including mining&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stratalisgroup.com/futurecasting-the-power-of-foresight/|title=The Stratalis Group {{!}}   Futurecasting: The Power of Foresight – The Final in a Six Part Series|website=www.stratalisgroup.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year. Early adopters of threatcasting include the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[Government of California]], and the Army Cyber Institute at [[United States Military Academy|West Point Military Academy]]. Official use of the term threatcasting is attributed to Brian David Johnson in a 2014 Gazette article “Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gazette.com/drones-smart-hydrants-considered-by-experts-looking-at-future-of-firefighting/article/1515148|title=Drones, smart hydrants considered by experts looking at future of firefighting|newspaper=Colorado Springs Gazette|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between Threatcasting and Strategic Planning ==
Threatcasting is fundamentally different from traditional [[strategic planning]] and [[Scenario analysis|scenario building]] processes due to the identification of specific actions, indicators and concrete steps that can be taken today to disrupt, mitigate and recover from future threats.

== Applications ==
The Army Cyber Institute at West Point in conjunction with [[Arizona State University Polytechnic campus|Arizona State University's]] Global Securities Initiative and the School for the Future of Innovation in Society have established a Threatcasting Lab to host and manage a Cyber Threatcasting Project which looks to envision future cyber threats ten years in the future. The first session of this collaborative group was held at West Point, NY in August 2016.

'''Transient modelling''' is a way of looking at a process with the primary criterion of time, observing the pattern of changes in the subject being studied over time. The obverse of it is [[Steady state]], where you might know only the starting and ending figures but do not understand the process by which they were derived.

Transient models will reveal the pattern of a process, which might be [[sinusoidal]] or another shape that will help to design a better system to manage that process. Transient models can be done on a [[spreadsheet]] with an ability to generate charts, or by any software that can handle data of inputs and outputs and generate some sort of a display. Transient modelling does not need a computer.  It is a methodology that has worked for centuries, by observers noting patterns of change against time, analysing the result and proposing improved design solutions.

A simple example is a garden [[water tank]]. This is being topped up by rainfall from the roof, but when the tank is full, the remaining water goes to the drain. When the gardener draws water off, the level falls. If the garden is large and the summer is hot, a steady state will occur in summer where the tank is nearly always empty in summer. If the season is wet, the garden is getting water from the sky, and the tank is not being emptied sufficiently, so in steady state it will be observed to be always full. If the gardener has a way of observing the level of water in the tank, and a record of daily rainfall and temperatures, and is precisely metering the amount of water being drawn off every day, the numbers and the dates can be recorded in spreadsheet at daily intervals. After enough samples are taken, a chart can be developed to model the rise and fall pattern over a year, or over 2 years. With a better understanding of the process, it might emerge that a 200litre water tank would run out 20–25 days a year, but a 400-litre water tank would never run out, and a 300-litre tank would run out only 1-2 day a year and therefore that would be an acceptable risk and it would be the most economical solution.

One of the best examples of transient modelling is [[transient climate simulation]]. The analysis of [[ice core]]s in glaciers to understand [[climate change]]. Ice cores have thousands of layers, each of which represents a winter season of snowfall, and trapped in these are bubbles of air, particle of space dust and pollen which reveal climatic data of the time. By mapping these to a time scale, scientists can analyse the fluctuations over time and make predictions for the future.

Transient modelling is the basis of [[weather forecasting]], of managing [[ecosystem]]s, rail timetabling, managing the electricity grid, setting the national budget, [[floating currency]], understanding traffic flows on a [[freeway]], solar gains on glass fronted buildings, or even of checking the day-to-day transactions of one's monthly [[bank statement]].

With the transient modelling approach, you understand the whole process better when the inputs and outputs are graphed against time.

In the system of [[Aristotelian logic]], the '''triangle of opposition''' is a diagram representing the different ways in which each of the three propositions of the system is logically related ('opposed') to each of the others. The system is also useful in the analysis of syllogistic logic, serving to identify the allowed logical conversions from one type to another.
