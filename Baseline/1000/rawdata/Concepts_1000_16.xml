      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12611">{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[grammar]], '''affirmation''' and '''negation''' ([[List of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] respectively '''{{sc|aff}}''' and '''{{sc|neg}}''') are the ways that grammar encode negative and positive polarity in [[verb phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, or other [[utterance]]s. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or [[truth]] of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s "Jane is here" and "Jane is not here"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.

The [[grammatical category]] associated and with affirmative and negative is called '''polarity'''. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as [[English grammar|English]] ''not'', an [[affix]] such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] -''nai'', or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called '''negation''' – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.

Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to [[question]]s) are often expressed using [[particle (grammar)|particle]]s or words such as [[yes and no|''yes'' and ''no'']], where ''yes'' is the affirmative and ''no'' the negative particle.

==Affirmative and negative responses==
{{main article|Yes and no}}
Special affirmative and negative words ([[particle (grammar)|particle]]s) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are ''yes'' and ''no'' respectively, in French ''oui'', ''si'' and ''non'', in Swedish ''ja'', ''jo'' and ''nej'', and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as [[Welsh grammar|Welsh]]) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly.

Complications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: "You're not going out? No."), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French ''si'' and Swedish ''jo'' (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).

== Grammatical rules for negation ==

===Simple negation of verbs and clauses===
Languages have a variety of [[grammar|grammatical]] rules for converting affirmative [[verb phrase]]s or [[clause]]s into negative ones.

In many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a [[grammatical particle|particle]], meaning "not". This may be added before the [[verb phrase]], as with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''no'':
* ''Está en casa.'' ("(S)he is at home", affirmative)
* '''''No''' está en casa.'' ("(S)he is not at home", negative)
Other examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''non'', [[Russian grammar|Russian]] не ''nye'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''nie'' (they can also be found in [[constructed language]]s: ''ne'' in [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] and ''non'' in [[Interlingua grammar|Interlingua]]). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]:
*''Ik zie hem.'' ("I see him", affirmative)
*''Ik zie hem '''niet'''.'' ("I do not see him", negative)
Particles following the verb in this way include ''not'' in archaic and dialectal [[English language|English]] ("you remember not"), ''nicht'' in [[German language|German]] (''ich schlafe nicht'', "I am not sleeping"), and ''inte'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] (''han hoppade inte'', "he did not jump").

In [[French language|French]], particles are added both before the verb phrase (''ne'') and after the verb (''pas''):
*''Je sais'' ("I know", affirmative)
*''Je '''ne''' sais '''pas''''' ("I don't know", negative).
However, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: ''Je sais pas''. Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in [[Afrikaans]]: ''Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie''''' ("He cannot speak Afrikaans").

In standard [[Modern English]], negation is achieved by adding ''not'' after an [[auxiliary verb]] (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be''; see [[English auxiliaries]]). If no such verb is present then the [[Auxiliary verb#Dummy|dummy auxiliary]] ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') is introduced – see [[do-support|''do''-support]].  For example:
*I have gone → I have '''not''' gone (''have'' is the auxiliary)
*He goes → He '''does not''' go (no auxiliary in the original sentence)
Different rules apply in [[subjunctive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[non-finite clause|non-finite]] clauses. For more details see {{slink|English grammar|Negation}}. (In [[Middle English]], the particle ''not'' could follow any verb, e.g. "I see not the horse.")

In some languages, like [[Welsh language|Welsh]], verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative [[grammatical mood|mood]].) An example is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix ''-nai'' (indicating negation), e.g. ''taberu'' ("eat") and ''tabe'''nai''''' ("do not eat"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct [[syntax]] in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in "he '''sings'''" vs. "he doesn't '''sing'''". [[Arnold Zwicky|Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Pullum]] have shown that ''n't'' is an [[inflection]]al suffix, not a [[clitic]] or a derivational suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex rules for negation also apply in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; see {{slink|Finnish grammar|Negation of verbs}}. In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[grammatical case|case]] of a [[direct object]] often changes from [[accusative]] to [[genitive]] when the verb is negated.

===Negation of other elements===
Negation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as [[adjective]]s and [[noun phrase]]s) within sentences.&lt;ref&gt;The linguist D. Biber refers to two types of negation, synthetic ('no', 'neither' or 'nor' negation) and analytic ('not' negation). For example, "He is neither here nor there" (synthetic) or "He is not here" (analytic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which this can be done again depend on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places ''not'' before the negated element, as in "I witnessed '''not a debate''', but a war." There are also negating affixes, such as the English [[prefix]]es ''non-'', ''un-'', ''in-'', etc. Such elements are called [[privative]]s.

===Multiple negation===
{{Main article|Double negative|Litotes}}
There also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including [[pronoun]]s such as ''nobody'', ''none'' and ''nothing'', [[determiners]] such as ''no'' (as in "no apples"), and adverbs such as ''never'', ''no longer'' and ''nowhere''.

Although such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, "I see nobody" is expressed as я никого́ не ви́жу ''ja nikovó nye vízhu'', literally "I nobody not see" – the ordinary negating particle не ''nye'' ("not") is used in addition to the negative pronoun никого́  ''nikovó'' ("nobody"). Italian behaves in a similar way: ''Non ti vede nessuno'', "nobody can see you", although ''Nessuno ti vede'' is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning.

In  [[Russian language|Russian]], all of the elements ("not", "never", "nobody", "nowhere") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but ''non'' does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: ''Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte''. "Nobody ever brings you anything here", however, could be translated ''Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente'' or ''Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno''. In French, where simple negation is performed using ''ne ... pas'' (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (''ne''), but ''pas'' is omitted:
*''Je '''ne''' bois '''jamais''''' ("I '''never''' drink")
*''Je '''ne''' vois '''personne''''' ("I see '''nobody'''")
*''Je '''n'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''ai '''jamais''' vu '''personne''''' ("I have '''never''' seen '''anybody'''") 
  
In [[Ancient Greek]], a simple negative (οὐ ''ou'' "not" or μή ''mḗ'' "not ([[Linguistic modality|modal]])") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. οὐδείς ''oudeís'' "nobody") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation:
* οὐδεὶς οὐκ ἔπασχέ τι ''oudeìs ouk épaskhé ti'', "nobody was not suffering something", i.e. "everybody was suffering"
* μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ''mḕ thorubḗsēi mēdeís'', "let (not) nobody raise an uproar", meaning "let nobody raise an uproar"

==Meaning of negation==
Simple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its [[negation|logical negation]] – replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case.

In some cases, however, particularly when a particular [[linguistic modality|modality]] is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of "you must not go" is not in fact the exact negation of that of "you must go" – this would be expressed as "you don't have to go" or "you needn't go". The negation "must not" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with ''must''). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of [[English modal verbs]].

In some cases, by way of [[irony]], an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see [[antiphrasis]] and [[sarcasm]].

For the use of double negations or similar as understatements ("not unappealing", "not bad", etc.) see [[litotes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9608">The '''Anna Karenina principle''' states that a deficiency in any [[Limiting factor|one of a number of factors]] dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor (subject to this principle) is one where every possible deficiency has been avoided.

The name of the principle derives from [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words: in order to be happy, a family must be successful on ''each and every one'' of ''a'' ''range'' of criteria e.g.: sexual attraction, money issues, parenting, religion, in-laws. Failure on only ''one'' of these counts leads to ''un''happiness. Thus there are more ways for a family to be unhappy than happy.

In [[statistics]], the term ''Anna Karenina principle'' is used to describe [[Statistical hypothesis testing|significance test]]s: there are any number of ways in which a dataset may violate the [[null hypothesis]] and only one in which all the assumptions are satisfied.

==Examples==

===Failed domestication===
The Anna Karenina principle was popularized by [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, J. |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |date=March 1997 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond uses this principle to illustrate why so few wild animals have been successfully domesticated throughout history, as a deficiency in any one of a great number of factors can render a species undomesticable. Therefore, all successfully domesticated species are not so because of a particular positive trait, but because of a lack of any number of possible negative traits. In chapter 9, six groups of reasons for failed domestication of animals are defined:

*'''Diet''' – To be a candidate for domestication, a species must be easy to feed. Finicky eaters make poor candidates. Non-finicky omnivores make the best candidates.
*'''Growth rate''' – The animal must grow fast enough to be economically feasible. Elephant farmers, for example, would wait perhaps 12 years for their herd to reach adult size.
*'''Captive breeding''' – The species must breed well in captivity. Species having [[mating]] rituals prohibiting breeding in a farm-like environment make poor candidates for domestication. These rituals could include the need for privacy or long, protracted mating chases.
*'''Disposition''' – Some species are too ill-tempered to be good candidates for domestication. Farmers must not be at risk of life or injury every time they enter the animal pen. The [[zebra]] is of special note in the book, as it was recognized by local cultures and Europeans alike as extremely valuable and useful to domesticate, but it proved impossible to tame. Horses in Africa proved to be susceptible to disease and attack by a wide variety of animals, while the very characteristics that made the zebra hardy and survivable in the harsh environment of Africa also made it fiercely independent.
*'''Tendency to panic''' – Species are genetically predisposed to react to danger in different ways. A species that immediately takes flight is a poor candidate for domestication. A species that freezes, or mingles with the herd for cover in the face of danger, is a good candidate. [[Deer]] in North America have proven almost impossible to domesticate and have difficulty breeding in captivity. Horses, however, immediately thrived from the time they were introduced to North America in the 16th century.
*'''Social structure''' – Species of lone, independent animals make poor candidates. A species that has a strong, well defined [[social hierarchy]] is more likely to be domesticated. A species that can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on a human as the head of the hierarchy is best. Different social groups must also be tolerant of one another.

==Ecological risk assessment==
{{See also|Liebig's law of the minimum}}

Moore describes applications of the ''Anna Karenina principle'' in [[ecology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Successful ecological risk assessments are all alike; every unsuccessful ecological risk assessment fails in its own way. Tolstoy posited a similar analogy in his novel Anna Karenina : "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." By that, Tolstoy meant that for a marriage to be happy, it had to succeed in several key aspects. Failure on even one of these aspects, and the marriage is doomed . . . the Anna Karenina principle also applies to ecological risk assessments involving multiple stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Dwayne R.J.|title=The Principle Applied to Ecological Risk Assessments of Multiple Stressors|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal|date=March 2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=231–237|doi=10.1080/20018091094349}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aristotle's version==

Much earlier, ''[[Aristotle]]'' states the same principle in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 2):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.2.ii.html Nicomachean Ethics], Translated by [[W. D. Ross]], Oxford University Press, Oxford; Revised edition (11 Jun 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the class of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to that of the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult – to miss the mark easy, to hit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are characteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue; For men are good in but one way, but bad in many.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Order in chaos of maladaptation==
Many experiments and observations of groups of humans, animals, trees, grassy plants, stockmarket prices, and changes in the banking sector proved the modified Anna Karenina principle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By studying the dynamics of correlation and variance in many systems facing external, or environmental, factors, we can typically, even before obvious symptoms of crisis appear, predict when one might occur, as correlation between individuals increases, and, at the same time, variance (and volatility) goes up.... '''All well-adapted systems are alike, all non-adapted systems experience maladaptation in their own way,... But in the chaos of maladaptation, there is an order'''. It seems, paradoxically, that as systems become more different they actually become more correlated within limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/media-centre/non-public/anna-karenina-principle-explains-bodily-stress-and-stockmarket-crashes Anna Karenina principle explains bodily stress and stockmarket crashes], University of Leicester, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This effect is proved for many systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=Alexander N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=Elena V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=Tatiana A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003_Correlations_Risk_and_Crisis_From_Physiology_to_Finance|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the adaptation of healthy people to a change in climate conditions to the analysis of fatal outcomes in oncological and cardiological clinics. The same effect is found in the stock market. The applicability of these two statistical indicators of stress, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations, for diagnosis of [[social stress]] in large groups was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;Rybnikov, S.R.; Rybnikova, N.A.; Portnov, B.A. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?] Psychology &amp; Developing Societies 29(1):98-123· March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==General mathematical backgrounds==
[[Vladimir Arnold]] in his book ''Catastrophe Theory'' describes "The Principle of Fragility of Good Things" which in a sense supplements the Principle of Anna Karenina: good systems must meet simultaneously a number of requirements; therefore, they are more fragile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... for systems belonging to the singular part of the stability boundary a small change of the parameters is more likely to send the system into the unstable region than into the stable region. This is a manifestation of a general principle stating that all good things (e.g. stability) are more fragile than bad things. It seems that in good situations a number of requirements must hold simultaneously, while to call a situation bad even one failure suffices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=V. I.|title=Catastrophe Theory|date=September 1992 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-54811-4 |edition=3rd Rev Exp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catastrophe_theory.html?id=GQoQyqia45gC |pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30561">'''Bateman's principle''', in [[evolutionary biology]], is that in most species, variability in [[reproductive success]] (or reproductive variance) is greater in males than in females. It was first proposed by [[Angus John Bateman]] (1919–1996), an English geneticist. Bateman suggested that, since males are capable of producing millions of sperm cells with little effort, while females invest much higher levels of energy in order to nurture a relatively small number of eggs, the female plays a significantly larger role in their offspring's reproductive success. Bateman’s paradigm thus views females as the limiting factor of parental investment, over which males will compete in order to [[copulate]] successfully.

Although Bateman's principle served as a cornerstone for the study of [[sexual selection]] for many decades, it has recently been subject to criticism. Attempts to reproduce Bateman's experiments in 2012 and 2013 were unable to support his conclusions. Some scientists have criticized Bateman's experimental and statistical methods, or pointed out conflicting evidence, while others have defended the veracity of the principle and cited evidence in support of it.

== Description ==
Typically it is the [[female]]s who have a relatively larger investment in producing each offspring. Bateman attributed the origin of the unequal investment to the differences in the production of gametes: sperm are cheaper than eggs. A single [[male]] can easily fertilize all females' eggs; she will not produce more offspring by mating with more than one male.  A male is capable of fathering more offspring if he mates with several females.  By and large, a male's potential reproductive success is limited by the number of females he mates with, whereas a female's potential reproductive success is limited by how many eggs she can produce. According to Bateman's principle, this results in [[sexual selection]], in which males compete with each other, and females become choosy in which males to mate with. Thus, as a result of being [[anisogamy|anisogamous]], males are fundamentally promiscuous, and females are fundamentally selective.

== History ==
Bateman initially published his review in 1948. He was a botanist, contributing to the literature of sexual selection only once in his lifetime. Bateman initially saw his study on Drosophila to be a test of Charles Darwin’s doctrine of sexual selection. He saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection not as flawed, but as incomplete. He felt that if he were to provide a concrete demonstration of how sexual selection played a role in the reproductive success of certain species, he could explain the gap between Darwin’s ideas and sexual dimorphism.

Although it is common to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his principle can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is that male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.

== Bateman's study ==
Throughout his research, Bateman conducted experiments using fruit flies in order to observe their copulation and sexual behavior. A total of six series of experiments were conducted with the fruit fly ''Drosophila melanogaster'', using three to five individuals of each sex. Each trial ran for three or four days. Some ran to completion without the transfer of the Drosophila from one environment (bottle) to another. In the others, Bateman transferred the flies and their eggs to a new bottle every day. Bateman also varied the age of the flies depending on the experiment, with an age gap between one and six days total. He never watched the flies' copulations. The flies used were from several inbred strains, which meant they could be identified by their specific inbred strain. Therefore, he inferred the number of involved mates based on the number of offspring that were later found to have mutations from both a male and a female. The difficulty that arose was that if a female Drosophila had copulated with five males and only one larva survived, Bateman would not be able to account for the other four copulations.

Analysis of the data collected in sets one through four showed that the males' reproductive success, estimated as the number of sired offspring, increased at a steady rate until a total of three mates were reached. It is important to note that Bateman kept the sex ratio of males to females completely even throughout his trials. But after surpassing three mates, male reproductive success began to fall. Female reproductive success also increased with number of mates, but much more gradually than that of the males. The second series of data collected in sets five and six illustrated a dramatically different outcome. Male reproductive success increased at a steady and steep rate, never dropping. Female reproductive success, on the other hand, plateaued after a single mate. Bateman focused mainly on the second series of data when discussing his results. His main conclusion was that the reproductive success of females does not increase with an influx of mates, as one fit mate was enough to successfully complete fertilization. This is often referred to as Bateman’s Gradient.

== Replication of Bateman's experiments ==
Throughout 2012 and 2013, Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson took it upon themselves to repeat Bateman's experiment in its entirety. While reproducing his tests, the same fly strains and mutations were used in order to maintain the same methodology. However, one of the 11 strains that Bateman used had gone extinct, and was thus replaced. (Tang-Martinez 2012)

Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson found that upon combining certain strains with one another, the offspring were unable to survive to adulthood. (Gowaty, Kim, &amp; Anderson 2012) Thus, Bateman’s numbers regarding the number of individuals not having mated was higher than the actual number. Likewise, his estimate of those that mated with one or more mates was too low. This was valid for both the males and females of this species.

Gowaty desired to further explore the reasoning behind the premature death of the Drosophila. She began doing so by running monogamy trials between different strains of flies and found that 25% of the offspring died due to becoming double mutants. (Gowaty 2013) Bateman thought his work fit within the lines of Mendel’s laws of genetics, while Gowaty proved otherwise. The 1948 experiments inferred reproductive success based on the number of adults living by the end of the trial. In reality, many factors were left out of the equation when calculating reproductive success as a function of the number of mates, which had the ability to completely dislodge the accuracy behind Bateman's results. Gowaty was not able to confirm Bateman's conclusions and found no evidence for sexual selection in the experiment. (Gowaty 2013; Tang-Martinez 2012)&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;

== Related experiments ==
Nevertheless, some modern experiments between the relationship of number of mates and the reproductive success of males and females support Bateman's principle. Julie Collet conducted an experiment with a population of red jungle fowl. A total of thirteen replicate groups of three males and four females were monitored for ten days. In this experiment, the sex ratio was biased toward females. A male's reproductive success was calculated using the proportion of embryos fathered to the total number of embryos produced by all the females he mated with. The total sexual selection opportunity was calculated using the following formula.

The ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;represents the variance in RS, while the{{clarify|date=December 2016}} is the square mean of reproductive success of members of one sex in a group.

In 2013, Fritzsche and Arnqvist tested Bateman's principle by estimating sexual selection between males and females in four seed beetles. They used a unique experimental design that showed sexual selection to be greater in males than in females. In contrast, sexual selection was also shown to be stronger for females in role-reversed species. They suggested that the Bateman gradient is typically the most accurate and informative measure of sexual selection between different sexes and species (Fritzsche, K. &amp; Arnqvist, G).{{full|date=June 2018}}

== Modern criticism ==
More than 60 years later, Bateman's principle has received considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success may result from random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive success can be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies are subject to change depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Newcomer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcomer|first=Scott D.|last2=Zeh|first2=Jeanne A.|last3=Zeh|first3=David W.|date=1999-08-31|title=Genetic benefits enhance the reproductive success of polyandrous females|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10236|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=96|issue=18|pages=10236–10241|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.18.10236|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10468592|pmc=17872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental and statistical criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model focused on his experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental and statistical calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, ''Drosophila melanogaster'', may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty conducted the first in-depth analysis of the data in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found sampling biases, mathematical errors, and selective presentation of data.&lt;ref name="Snyder2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=Brian F. |last2=Gowaty |first2=Patricia Adair |title=A Reappraisal of Bateman's Classic Study of Intrasexual Selection |journal=Evolution |date=November 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2457–2468 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00212.x|pmid=17725639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review by [[Zuleyma Tang-Martinez|Zuleyma Tang-Martínez]] concluded that various empirical and theoretical studies, especially Gowaty's reproduction of Bateman's original experiment, pose a major challenge to Bateman's conclusions, and that Bateman's principle should be considered an unproven hypothesis in need of further reexamination.&lt;ref name="Tang-Martinez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang-Martinez|first1=Zuleyma|title=Repetition of Bateman challenges the paradigm|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=6 July 2012|volume=109|issue=29|pages=11476–11477|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209394109|pmid=22773808|pmc=3406825}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tang-Martínez, "modern data simply don't support most of Bateman's and [[Robert Trivers|Trivers']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s predictions and assumptions."&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tang-Martinez |first1=Zuleyma |title=Data Should Smash the Biological Myth of Promiscuous Males and Sexually Coy Females |url=http://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 review confirmed Darwinian sex roles across the animal kingdom, concluding that "sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500983|title=Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom|first1=Tim|last1=Janicke|first2=Ines K.|last2=Häderer|first3=Marc J.|last3=Lajeunesse|first4=Nils|last4=Anthes|date=1 February 2016|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e1500983|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=advances.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500983|pmid=26933680|pmc=4758741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One error source that have been shown to give an illusion of greater differential in reproductive success in males than in females genetically is that chromosome effects cause a greater percentage of mutations to be lethal before even reaching sexual maturity in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gowaty | first=P. A. | last2=Kim | first2=Y.-K. | last3=Anderson | first3=W. W. | title=No evidence of sexual selection in a repetition of Bateman's classic study of Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=109 | issue=29 | date=11 June 2012 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1207851109 | pmid=22689966 | pmc=3406809 | pages=11740–11745 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/06/1207851109.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that any differential in reproductive success between males and females among the individuals that do reach sexual maturity must be due to sexual selection in the current population is also subject to criticism, such as the possibility of remnants of sexually selected traits in a previous species from which a new species have evolved can be negatively selected due to costs in nutrients and weakened immune systems and that such negative selection would cause a higher difference in reproductive success in males than in females even without any still ongoing sexual selection. Since lower degrees of selection during times of stable environment allows genetic variation to build up by random mutations and allow some individuals in a population to survive environmental change while strong constant selection offsets the effect and increases the risk of the entire population dying out during catastrophic environmental change due to less genetic variation, constant loss of genetic variation caused by sexual selection have been suggested as a factor contributing to higher [[extinction]] rates in more sexually dimorphic species besides the nutrient, immunity and other costs of the ornaments themselves. While the ornament cost risk would only be removed when the ornaments have been eliminated by selection, the genetic variation model predicts that the species ability to survive would improve significantly even at an early stage of reduction of sexual dimorphism due to other adaptive mutations arising and surviving due to minimal selection during times of stable environment while the genes causing sexually dimorphic anatomy have only in small part been affected by the mutations. Applied to human evolution, this model can explain why early [[Homo sapiens]] display a significantly increased adaptability to environmental change already at its early divergence from [[Homo erectus]] that had a high muscular sexual dimorphism, as well as why human anatomy through the history of Homo sapiens show a diversification during times of stable climate and a selective loss of the more robust male forms during environmental change that does not recover during later stability, continuing through the loss of many robust characteristics in regional bottlenecks as recent as the end of the Ice Age and the time around the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]. It also explains genetic evidence of human genetic diversity increasing during stable environmental periods and being reduced during bottlenecks related to changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthes | first=Nils | last2=Häderer | first2=Ines K. | last3=Michiels | first3=Nico K. | last4=Janicke | first4=Tim | editor-last=Schielzeth | editor-first=Holger | title=Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines | journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution | volume=8 | issue=8 | date=20 December 2016 | issn=2041-210X | doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12707 | pages=918–931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zuk | first=Marlene | last2=Garcia-Gonzalez | first2=Francisco | last3=Herberstein | first3=Marie Elisabeth | last4=Simmons | first4=Leigh W. | title=Model Systems, Taxonomic Bias, and Sexual Selection: Beyond Drosophila | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=59 | issue=1 | date=7 January 2014 | issn=0066-4170 | doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-011613-162014 | pmid=24160422 | pages=321–338 | hdl=10261/90632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
Recently, DNA testing has permitted more detailed investigation of mating behavior in numerous species. The results, in many cases, have been cited as evidence against Bateman's principle.&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tang-Martínez | first=Zuleyma | title=Rethinking Bateman's Principles: Challenging Persistent Myths of Sexually Reluctant Females and Promiscuous Males | journal=The Journal of Sex Research | volume=53 | issue=4–5 | date=13 April 2016 | issn=0022-4499 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1150938 | pmid=27074147 | pages=532–559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, most bird species were believed to be sexually monogamous.

== Incompatibility with other sex difference claims ==
There are a number of claims about sex differences in humans said by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] to be well supported that are not logically predicted by Bateman's principle. One example that have been pointed out is [[language]] ability that is said to be more developed in women than in men. It is argued that language, being a [[origin of language|derived human trait]], is not predicted by a model that assumes males to be more selected than females to be present to a higher degree in women than in men but the opposite. The objection about a trade-off between [[spatial ability]] and language is found lacking due to the existence of animals that outperform humans on spatial tasks such as [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[bat]]s while having much smaller and more rapidly maturing brains than humans, while [[great ape language]] is limited and ungrammatical at best despite great apes being much closer to humans in brain capacity than bats or birds of prey are, showing that the system requirements for spatial ability are much lower than those for language and therefore not a serious trade-off for them. The generalization of Bateman's principle to societies lacking modern [[birth control]] is also argued to be incompatible with such generalization of the "nuns more successful at [[celibacy]] than monks" clause of the female [[erotic plasticity]] model, as absence of modern contraceptives would mean that absence of reproduction for many men required that many men had no sexual relationships with women while male sexual exclusivity to a particular gender, if present, would have precluded same-sex relationships as a form of non-celibacy for men who could not find a female mate as well. It is also mentioned that the evolutionary psychologists themselves claim that women are sexually picky due to an evolutionary history without modern contraception, while it is pointed out that the notion of celibacy being impossible for men in general with only a small number of individual exceptions is incompatible with the notion of evolution making celibacy inevitable for a significant percentage of men.&lt;ref&gt;PD Lorch, L Bussière, DT Gwynne (2008) "Quantifying the potential for sexual dimorphism using upper limits on Bateman gradients"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Ah-King, I Ahnesjö - Evolutionary biology (2013) "The “sex role” concept: an overview and evaluation"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-role reversed species ==
The most well-known exceptions to Bateman's principle are the existence of sex-role reversed species such as pipefish ([[seahorse]]s), [[phalarope]]s and [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s in which the males perform the majority of the parental care, and are cryptic while the females are highly ornamented and territorially aggressive ({{Harvcolnb|Emlen|Oring|1977}}; {{Harvcolnb|Knowlton|1982}}; {{Harvcolnb|Berglund|Widemo|Rosenqvist|2005}}). 

In these species, however, the typical fundamental sex differences are reversed: females have a faster reproductive rate than males (and thus greater reproductive variance), and males have greater assurance of genetic parentage than do females {{Harv|Flinn|2004}}. Consequently, reversals in sex roles and reproductive variance are consistent with Bateman's principle, and with Robert Trivers's [[parental investment]] theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">{{Immanuel Kant}}

In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy, a '''category''' ({{lang-de|Categorie}} in the [[Critique of Pure Reason|original]] or ''Kategorie'' in [[modern German]]) is a pure concept of the [[#The table of judgments|understanding]] (''Verstand''). A Kantian category is a characteristic of the appearance of any object in general, before it has been experienced. Kant wrote that "They are concepts of an object in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', B129, (''Sie sind Begriffe von einem Gegenstande überhaupt'')&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also wrote that, "…pure cоncepts [Categories] of the undеrstanding which apply to objects of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 79 (''reine Verstandesbegriffe, welche a priori auf Gegenstände der Anschauung überhaupt gehen'')&lt;/ref&gt; Such a category is not a classificatory division, as the word is commonly used. It is, instead, the condition of the [[Epistemic possibility|possibility]] of objects in general,&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 139&lt;/ref&gt; that is, objects as such, any and all objects, not specific objects in particular.

== Meaning of "category" ==

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:κατηγορία|κατηγορία]], ''katēgoria'', meaning "that which can be said, predicated, or publicly declared and asserted, about something." A category is an attribute, property, quality, or characteristic that can be predicated of a thing. "…I remark concerning the categories…that their logical employment consists in their use as predicates of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], June 20, 1797&lt;/ref&gt; Kant called them "ontological predicates."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt;

A category is that which can be said of everything in general, that is, of anything that is an object. [[J.S. Mill|John Stuart Mill]] wrote: "The Categories, or Predicaments &amp;mdash; the former a Greek word, the latter its literal translation in the Latin language &amp;mdash; were believed to be an enumeration  of all things capable of being named, an enumeration by the ''summa genera'' (highest kind), i.e., the most extensive classes into which things could be distributed, which, therefore, were so many highest Predicates, one or other of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, ''[[A System of Logic]]'', I, 3, §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] had claimed that the following ten predicates or categories could be asserted of anything in general: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, affection (passivity), place, time (date), position, and state. These are supposed to be the qualities or attributes that can be affirmed of each and every thing in experience. Any particular object that exists in thought must have been able to have the Categories attributed to it as possible predicates because the Categories are the properties, qualities, or characteristics of any possible object in general. The Categories of Aristotle and Kant are the general properties that belong to all things without expressing the peculiar nature of any particular thing. Kant appreciated Aristotle's effort, but said that his table was imperfect because " … as he had no guiding principle, he merely picked them up as they occurred to him..."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Categories do not provide knowledge of individual, particular objects. Any object, however, must have Categories as its characteristics if it is to be an object of experience. It is presupposed or assumed that anything that is a specific object must possess Categories as its properties because Categories are predicates of an object in general. An object in general does not have all of the Categories as predicates at one time.  For example, a general object cannot have the qualitative Categories of reality and negation at the same time. Similarly, an object in general cannot have both unity and plurality as quantitative predicates at once. The Categories of Modality exclude each other. Therefore, a general object cannot simultaneously have the Categories of possibility/impossibility and existence/non&amp;ndash;existence as qualities.

Since the Categories are a list of that which can be said of every object, they are related only to human language. In making a verbal statement about an object, a speaker makes a judgment. A general object, that is, every object, has attributes that are contained in Kant's list of Categories. In a judgment, or verbal statement, the Categories are the predicates that can be asserted of every object and all objects.

==The table of judgments&lt;!--'Understanding (Kant)' redirects here--&gt;==
Kant believed that the ability of the human '''understanding'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (German: ''Verstand'', Greek: ''[[dianoia]]'' "διάνοια", Latin: ''[[ratio]]'') to think about and know an object is the same as the making of a spoken or written judgment about an object. According to him, "Our ability to judge is equivalent to our ability to think."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 80&lt;/ref&gt;
A judgment is the thought that a thing is known to have a certain quality or attribute. For example, the sentence "The rose is red" is a judgment. Kant created a table of the forms of such judgments as they relate to all objects in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 71&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Table of Judgements
|-
! Category !! colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | Judgements 
|-
! [[Quantity]]
| Universal|| [[Particular]]|| [[Grammatical number#Singular versus plural|Singular]]

|-
! [[Linguistic modality|Modality]]
| Problematical|| [[Assertoric]]|| [[Apodicticity|Apodictic]]
|-
|}

This table of judgments was used by Kant as a model for the table of categories. Taken together, these twelvefold tables constitute the formal structure for Kant's [[Kantian architectonics|architectonic]] conception of his philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp.266-288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 ''Kant's System of Perspectives'']: ''An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy'' (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schemata==
Categories are entirely different from the appearances of objects. According to Kant, in order to relate to specific phenomena, categories must be "applied" through [[time]]. The way that this is done is called a [[Schema (Kant)|schema]].

==Criticism==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], in his [[Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy|criticism of the Kantian philosophy]], found many errors{{Examples|date=September 2018}} in Kant's use of the Categories of Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Modality. Schopenhauer also noted that in accordance with Kant's claim, non-human animals would not be able to know objects. Animals would only know impressions on their [[sense organ]]s, which Kant mistakenly{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} calls [[perception]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3168">In [[computer science]] and [[quantum physics]], the '''Church–Turing–Deutsch principle''' ('''CTD principle''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Michael|title=Interesting problems: The Church–Turing–Deutsch Principle|url=http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/interesting-problems-the-church-turing-deutsch-principle|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a stronger, physical form of the [[Church&amp;ndash;Turing thesis]] formulated by [[David Deutsch]] in 1985.

==Statement==
The principle states that a [[Turing completeness|universal]] [[computer|computing device]] can [[simulation|simulate]] every [[physical process]].

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to [[finitary]] machines and processes.&lt;!-- so who (re)interpreted it in the form stated here? --&gt; He observed that [[classical physics]], which makes use of the concept of [[real number]]s, cannot be simulated by a [[Turing machine]], which can only represent [[computable real]]s. Deutsch proposed that [[quantum computer]]s may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of [[quantum physics]] can completely describe every physical process.

An earlier version of this thesis for classical computers was stated by Alan Turing's friend and student [[Robin Gandy]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Gandy, R. (1980). Church’s thesis and principles for mechanisms. ''Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics'' (101), 123-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaznatcheev|first=Artem|title=Falsifiability and Gandy’s variant of the Church-Turing thesis|url=https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2014/09/01/falsifiability-and-gandys-variant-of-the-church-turing-thesis/|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11532">British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] formulated three [[adage]]s that are known as '''Clarke's three laws''', of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited. They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception|last=Beech|first=Martin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9781461406150|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws include:

#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}} When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}} The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}} Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's "laws" were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When|last=Keyes|first=Ralph|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2006|isbn=9780312340049|location=New York|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three laws appear in Clarke's essay "Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination", first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;"'Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination'" in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as "Clarke's Law" in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies---How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths|last=Shermer|first=Michael|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC|year=2011|isbn=9780805091250|location=New York|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: "As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there".

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the "Hazards of Prophecy" essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|publisher=Popular Library|year=1973|isbn=9780330236195|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: "Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned".&lt;ref&gt;"The Sorcerer of Rhiannon", ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: "...a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic," and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: "The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood."

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he "would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic", referring to his memory of "seeing and hearing [[Lynotype|Linotype]] machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’".&lt;ref name="Gooden2015"/&gt;

== Proposed fourth law ==
A fourth law has been proposed for the canon, despite Clarke's declared intention of stopping at three laws. [[Geoff Holder]] quotes: "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert,"&lt;ref&gt;Holder, Geoff (2009). ''101 Things to Do with a Stone Circle''. The History Press, 2009. Holder offers as his source Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' (Millennium Edition, 1999, paperback edition page 143, {{ISBN|0-575-40277-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of American economist [[Thomas Sowell]]'s "For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert, but for every fact there is not necessarily an equal and opposite fact", from his 1995 book ''[[The Vision of the Anointed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[ Massimo Pigliucci]], ''Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk'', 2010, {{ISBN|0226667871}}; an epigraph to Chapter 12, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;pg=PA279 p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants of the third law ==

The third law has inspired many [[snowclone]]s and other variations:

A '''conceptual model''' is a representation of a system, made of the composition of [[concept]]s which are used to help people [[knowledge|know]], [[understanding|understand]], or [[simulation|simulate]] a subject the model represents. It is also a set of concepts. Some [[physical model|models]] are [[physical object]]s; for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like the object it represents.

The term ''conceptual model'' may be used to refer to models which are formed after a [[wikt:concept#Noun|conceptualization]] or [[generalization]] process.&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world whether physical or social. [[Semantics|Semantic]] studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation. Semantics is basically about concepts, the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience.

== Overview ==
=== Models of concepts and models that are conceptual ===
The term ''conceptual model'' is normal. It could mean "a model of concept" or it could mean "a model that is conceptual." A distinction can be made between ''what models are'' and ''what models are made of''. With the exception of iconic models, such as a scale model of [[Winchester Cathedral]], most models are concepts. But they are, mostly, intended to be models of real world states of affairs. The value of a model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to a past, present, future, actual or potential state of affairs. A model of a concept is quite different because in order to be a good model it need not have this real world correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Frank Hutson (January 1992) [http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Cause,_Effect,_Efficiency_%26_Soft_Systems_Models Cause, Effect, Efficiency &amp; Soft Systems Models] Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42. With revisions and additions it was published in the ''Journal of the Operational Research Society'' (1993) 44(4), pp. 149–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In artificial intelligence conceptual models and [[conceptual graphs]] are used for building [[expert systems]] and [[knowledge-based systems]]; here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true.

=== Type and scope of conceptual models ===
Conceptual models (models that are conceptual) range in type from the more concrete, such as the [[mental image]] of a familiar physical object, to the formal generality and abstractness of [[mathematical model]]s which do not appear to the mind as an image. Conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent. A model may, for instance, represent a single thing (e.g. the ''Statue of Liberty''), whole classes of things (e.g. ''the electron''), and even very vast domains of subject matter such as ''the physical universe.'' The variety and scope of conceptual models is due to then variety of purposes had by the people using them.
Conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication."&lt;ref name="Mylopoulos"&gt;{{cite book | first =  J. | last = Mylopoulos | author-link=John Mylopoulos|chapter = Conceptual modeling and Telos1 | editor1-first = P. | editor1-last = Loucopoulos | editor2-first = R | editor2-last = Zicari | title = Conceptual Modeling, Databases, and Case An integrated view of information systems development | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | citeseerx = 10.1.1.83.3647 | pages = 49–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamental objectives ===
A conceptual model's primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents. Also, a conceptual model must be developed in such a way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the models users. A conceptual model, when implemented properly, should satisfy four fundamental objectives.&lt;ref name="Kung and Solveberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=20143.20149 |title=C.H. Kung, A. Solvberg, Activity Modeling and Behavior Modeling, In: T. Ollie, H. Sol, A. Verrjin-Stuart, Proceedings of the IFIP WG 8.1 working conference on comparative review of information systems design methodologies: improving the practice.

# Enhance an individual's understanding of the representative system
# Facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders
# Provide a point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications
# Document the system for future reference and provide a means for collaboration

The conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle. Figure 1&lt;ref name="Sokolowski"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Sokolowski |editor1-first=John A. |editor2-last=Banks |editor2-first=Catherine M. |date=2010 |title=Modeling and Simulation Fundamentals: Theoretical Underpinnings and Practical Domains |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470486740 |oclc=436945978 |doi=10.1002/9780470590621}}&lt;/ref&gt; below, depicts the role of the conceptual model in a typical system development scheme. It is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed, the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly, giving way to future problems or system shortfalls. These failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to; lack of user input, incomplete or unclear requirements, and changing requirements. Those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling. The importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives/techniques.

== Modelling techniques ==
{{Main article|Conceptual model (computer science)}}

As systems have become increasingly complex, the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded. With that expanded presence, the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of a system is being realized. Building on that realization, numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created. These techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the users understanding of the system to be modeled.&lt;ref name="Science Direct"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TYX-4GPVP8P-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2006&amp;_alid=1566452383&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5630&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=9090&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d8982c2440adcdec4575f8d0e0e4432f&amp;searchtype=a I. Davies, P. Green, M. Rosemann, M. Indulska, S. Gallo, How do practitioners use conceptual modeling in practice?, Elsevier, Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering 58 (2006) pp.358–80]&lt;/ref&gt; A few techniques are briefly described in the following text, however, many more exist or are being developed. Some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include: [[workflow]] modeling, [[workforce modeling]], [[rapid application development]], [[object-role modeling]], and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).

=== Data flow modeling ===

Data flow modeling (DFM) is a basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of a system. DFM is a fairly simple technique, however, like many conceptual modeling techniques, it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams. The [[data flow diagram]] usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information, but rather works to bring the major system functions into context. Data flow modeling is a central technique used in systems development that utilizes the [[structured systems analysis and design method]] (SSADM).

=== Entity relationship modeling (Ontology oriented) ===

[[Entity-relationship model]]ing (ERM) is a conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation. Entity-relationship diagrams, which are a product of executing the ERM technique, are normally used to represent database models and information systems. The main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships. The entities can represent independent functions, objects, or events. The relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another. To form a system process, the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process. Multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique; [[IDEF1X]], [[Bachman diagram|Bachman]], and [[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]], to name a few. These conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects.

=== Event-driven process chain ===

The [[event-driven process chain]] (EPC) is a conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows. Like most conceptual modeling techniques, the event driven process chain consists of entities/elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed. More specifically, the EPC is made up of events which define what state a process is in or the rules by which it operates. In order to progress through events, a function/ active event must be executed. Depending on the process flow, the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains. Other elements exist within an EPC, all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates. The EPC technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning, process improvement, and logistics.

=== Joint application development ===

The [[dynamic systems development method]] uses a specific process called JEFFF to conceptually model a systems life cycle. JEFFF is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes a projects initialization. The JAD process calls for a series of workshops in which the participants work to identify, define, and generally map a successful project from conception to completion. This method has been found to not work well for large scale applications, however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E. J. | title = Joint application design (JAD) in practice | doi = 10.1016/S0164-1212(98)10080-8 | journal = Journal of Systems and Software | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–23 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place/transition net ===

Also known as [[Petri net]]s, this conceptual modeling technique allows a system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means. The petri net, because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory, is a useful technique for modeling [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent system behavior]], i.e. simultaneous process executions.

=== State transition modeling ===

State transition modeling makes use of [[state transition diagram]]s to describe system behavior. These state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes. Most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling. The use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for [[finite-state machine]]s.

=== Technique evaluation and selection ===
Because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for a broad area of use, the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult. To alleviate this issue, and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique, the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text. However, before evaluating the effectiveness of a conceptual modeling technique for a particular application, an important concept must be understood; Comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted. Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a conceptual [[modeling language]] when choosing an appropriate technique. In general, a conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique. That technique will utilize a conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at. Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a conceptual modeling technique, as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability. Also, the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented, whether it be complex or simple.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1007/s00766-004-0204-6 | title = A framework for empirical evaluation of conceptual modeling techniques | journal = Requirements Engineering | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Considering affecting factors ====

Building on some of their earlier work,&lt;ref name="early Gemino and Wand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gemino | first1 = A. | last2 = Wand | first2 = Y. | doi = 10.1145/944217.944243 | title = Evaluating modeling techniques based on models of learning | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 79–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemino and Wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors: the content that the conceptual model must represent, the method in which the model will be presented, the characteristics of the models users, and the conceptual model languages specific task.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The conceptual models content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented. The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the techniques ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail. The characteristics of the models users or participants is an important aspect to consider. A participant's background and experience should coincide with the conceptual models complexity, else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that systems realization. The conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen. The difference between creating a system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating a system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve to completely different types of conceptual modeling languages.

==== Considering affected variables ====

Gemino and Wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison.&lt;ref name="Gemino and Wand" /&gt; The focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create a "new product", or whether the technique will only bring about a more intimate understanding of the system being modeled. The criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective. A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a [[system model]] which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient, but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes, rendering the model less effective.

When deciding which conceptual technique to use, the recommendations of Gemino and Wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question. Understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to a more informed selection of a technique that properly addresses that particular model. In summary, when deciding between modeling techniques, answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations.

# What content will the conceptual model represent?
# How will the conceptual model be presented?
# Who will be using or participating in the conceptual model?
# How will the conceptual model describe the system?
# What is the conceptual models focus of observation?
# Will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system?

Another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide a rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness.

==Models in philosophy and science==

=== Mental model ===
{{Further information|Mental model|Representation (psychology)|Cognitive model}}
In cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, a mental model is a representation of something in the mind,&lt;ref&gt;Mental Representation:The Computational Theory of Mind, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/]&lt;/ref&gt; but a [[mental model]] may also refer to a nonphysical external model of the mind itself.&lt;ref&gt;Mental Models and Usability, Depaul University, Cognitive Psychology 404, Nov, 15, 1999, Mary Jo Davidson, Laura Dove, Julie Weltz, [http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical models ===
A metaphysical model is a type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope; a metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=Matthew H. |editor2-last=Yudell |editor2-first=Zanja |date=2017 |title=Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Science: New Essays |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199363209 |oclc=956947667 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that it [[explanation|explains]] the answers to fundamental questions such as whether [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[mind]] are one or two [[Physical substance|substance]]s; or whether or not humans have [[free will]].

=== Conceptual model vs. semantics model ===
{{confusing|section|reason=the poor English might have a lot to do with it, but it is very hard to define even the basic idea of what the difference is between conceptual and semantic modelling. An example might help|date=October 2014}}

=== Epistemological models ===
An epistemological model is a type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the [[knowledge|known]] and the knowable, and the [[belief|believed]] and the believable.

=== Logical models ===
In [[logic]], a model is a type of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] under which a particular statement is true. Logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts, such as mathematical models; and ones which attempt to represent physical objects, and factual relationships, among which are scientific models.

[[Model theory]] is the study of (classes of) mathematical structures such as groups, fields, graphs, or even universes of set theory, using tools from mathematical logic. A system that gives meaning to the sentences of a formal language is called a model for the language. If a model for a language moreover satisfies a particular sentence or theory (set of sentences), it is called a model of the sentence or theory. Model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra.

=== Mathematical models ===
{{Main article|Mathematical model}}

Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures.

A more comprehensive type of mathematical model&lt;ref&gt;DI Spivak, RE Kent. "Ologs: a category-theoretic approach to knowledge representation" (2011). PLoS ONE (in press): e24274. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0024274}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses a linguistic version of [[category theory]] to model a given situation.  Akin to [[entity-relationship models]], custom [[category (mathematics)|categories]] or [[sketch (mathematics)|sketches]] can be directly translated into [[database schema]]s. The difference is that logic is replaced by category theory, which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling, especially useful for translating between disparate models (as functors between categories).

=== Scientific models ===
{{Main article|Scientific modelling}}

A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality. A scientific model represents [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al way.  Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] for which [[reality]] is the only interpretation.  The world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;edited by Hans Freudenthal (1951), ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences]'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical models ==
{{Further information|Statistical model|Parametric model|Nonparametric statistics|Model selection}}
A statistical model is a [[probability distribution function]] proposed as generating data. In a [[parametric model]], the probability distribution function has variable parameters, such as the [[mean]] and [[variance]] in a [[normal distribution]], or the [[coefficients]] for the various [[exponent]]s of the [[independent variable]] in [[linear regression]]. A [[nonparametric statistics|nonparametric model]] has a distribution function without parameters, such as in [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], and is only loosely confined by assumptions. [[Model selection]] is a statistical method for selecting a distribution function within a class of them; e.g., in linear regression where the dependent variable is a polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients, model selection is selecting the highest exponent, and may be done with nonparametric means, such as with [[cross-validation (statistics)|cross validation]].

In statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events. For example, a statistical model of customer behavior is a model that is conceptual (because behavior is physical),  but a statistical model of customer satisfaction is a model of a concept (because satisfaction is a mental not a physical event).

== Social and political models ==

=== Economic models ===
{{Main article|Economic model}}
In [[economics]], a model is a theoretical construct that represents economic processes by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using mathematical techniques. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying parameters in a model or class of models.  A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.

== Models in systems architecture ==
{{Main article|System model}}
A system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure, behavior, and more [[View model|views]] of a [[system]]. A system model can represent [[View model|multiple views]] of a system by using two different approaches. The first one is the non-architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach. The non-architectural approach respectively picks a model for each view. The architectural approach, also known as [[system architecture]], instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models, will use only one integrated architectural model.

===Business process modelling===
{{Main article|Business process modeling}}
[[File:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction for Business process modelling&lt;ref&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). "Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process." in: ''3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, [[Budapest, Hungary]]'', June 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''. Process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering. Process models are:
* Processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model.
* A description of a process at the type level.
* Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it.
The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations.

One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Rolland]] and C. Thanos Pernici (1998). "A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering". In: ''Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98, B. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1413'', [[Pisa, Italy]], Springer, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models in information system design==

=== Conceptual models of human activity systems ===
{{Main article|Soft systems methodology}}
Conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology (SSM), which is a method of systems analysis concerned with the [[Problem structuring methods|structuring of problems]] in management. These models are models of concepts; the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent a state of affairs in the physical world. They are also used in information [[requirements analysis]] (IRA) which is a variant of SSM developed for information system design and software engineering.

=== Logico-linguistic models ===
{{Main article|Logico-linguistic modeling}}
Logico-linguistic modeling is another variant of SSM that uses conceptual models. However, this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events. It is a graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events.

=== Data models ===

==== Entity-relationship model ====
{{Main article|Entity-relationship model}}
In software engineering, an entity-relationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity-relationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs.

Entity-relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.

==== Domain model ====
{{Main article|Domain model}}
A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the [[problem domain]]). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model.

Like entity-relationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Abélard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Suárez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincaré's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant’s Conceptualism, and Kant’s Non-Conceptualism" – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41–64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exclusion principle''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] principle that states:

:If an [[event (philosophy)|event]] ''e'' [[causality|causes]] event ''e*'', then there is no event ''e#'' such that ''e#'' is [[supervenience|non-supervenient]] on ''e'' and ''e#'' causes ''e*''.

==In physicalism==
{{Main|physicalism}}
The exclusion principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario; One usually considers that the desire to lift one’s arm as a mental event, and the lifting on one's arm, a physical event. According to the exclusion principle, there must be no event that does not supervene on ''e'' while causing ''e*''. To show this better, substitute "''the desire to lift one's arm''" for "''e''", and "''one to lift their arm''" for "''e*''".

:If ''the desire to lift one's arm'' causes ''one to lift their arm'', then there is no event such that it is non-supervenient on ''the desire to lift one's arm'' and it causes ''one to lift their arm''.

This is interpreted as meaning that mental events supervene upon the physical. However, some philosophers do not accept this principle, and accept [[epiphenomenalism]], which states that mental events are caused by physical events, but physical events are not caused by mental events (called ''causal impotence''). However, If ''e#'' does not cause ''e'', then there is no way to verify that ''e*'' exists. Yet, this debate has not been settled in the philosophical community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13067">The '''General Group Problem Solving (GGPS) Model''' is a [[problem solving]] methodology, in which a group of individuals will define the desired outcome, identify the gap between the current state and the target and generate ideas for closing the gap by [[brainstorming]]. The end result is list of actions needed to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6wsVIuA03YC | title=Group Problem Solving | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Laughlin, Patrick R. | year=2011 | pages=1 | isbn=9781400836673 | quote=In the most general sense, a problem is a discrepancy between a current less desirable state and a future more desirable state.

==Beyond groupthink==
Sally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group [[decision-making]] models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the [[groupthink]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ggps_model"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/2323226/The_GGPS_Model_Broadening_the_perspective_on_group_problem_solving | title=The GGPS Model: Broadening the perspective on group problem solving | work=Groups at work: Theory and research | date=2001 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | last1=Fuller | first1=Sally R. | last2=Aldag | first2=Ramon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/scie/Career/Wisdom/groupthink1.htm | title=Groupthink | work=Psychology Today | date=November 1971 | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | pages=43-46, 74-76 | quote=Groupthink is a psychological terminology used to describe the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive ingroup that it tends to override realistic appraisal of alternative courses of action.  It refers to a deterioration in mental efficiency, reality testing and moral judgments as a result of group pressures.  The symptoms of groupthink arise when the members of decision-making groups become motivated to avoid being too harsh in their judgments of their leaders' or their colleagues' ideas.  People would adopt a soft line of criticism and avoid conflict, even in their own thinking.  At meetings, all members are amiable and seek complete concurrence, which is likely to be recognized erroneously as consensus, on every important issue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Victims_of_Groupthink.html?id=FB13AAAAMAAJ | title=Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | accessdate=11 December 2014 | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1972 | isbn=9780395140024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to them, group decision-making has often been framed in relative isolation, ignoring context and real-world circumstances, which is a likely consequence of testing group decision-making in laboratory studies. They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.” &lt;ref name="ggps_model" /&gt; To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research.&lt;ref name="fiasco"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1993-29328-001 | title=Beyond fiasco: a reappraisal of the groupthink phenomenon and a new model of group decision processes | author=Aldag, R.J. | last2=Fuller | first2=S.R. | journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=May 1993  | volume=113 | issue=3 | pages=533-552 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.3.533 | quote=...research does not provide convincing support for the validity of the groupthink phenomenon or for the suggestion that groupthink characteristics lead to negative outcomes. This review, coupled with evidence from other literature suggested by a problem-solving perspective and a direct examination of groupthink implicit assumptions, guided the development of a new, more general model termed the general group problem-solving model. This model incorporates a variety of antecedent conditions, emergent group characteristics, decision process characteristics, and group decision outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model includes elements of [[Irving Janis|Irving Janis's]] original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature.&lt;ref name="decision_making"&gt;{{cite book | title=Decision making: a psychological analysis of conflict, choice, and commitment | publisher=Free Press | author=Janis, Irving L. | year=1977 | isbn=9780029161609 | last2=Mann | first2=Leon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the '''GGPS-model''' first.

==The original groupthink model==
Janis defines groupthink as “the mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_janis" /&gt; In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: “I use the term "groupthink" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.  Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.”&lt;ref name="groupthink_victims" /&gt;
All this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see [[Groupthink#Symptoms|groupthink symptoms]]).

[[File:Groupthink schematic.JPG|Groupthink schematic]]{{or|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="decision_making" /&gt;

==The GGPS-model==
The GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic.
Two key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis’ model:

# The GGPS model presents elements of the group problem-solving process in a value-neutral manner. The groupthink model is restrictive and deterministic in the sense that numerous elements are phrased to suggest that certain aspects of the process are pathological, such as ”too few alternatives”.  The GGPS model suggests no such assumptions in its terms, and recasts this term as ”number of alternatives”. 
# Fuller and Aldag argue that a comprehensive model has to reflect the political environment of the real world and real workplaces. Thus, the GGPS model considers a larger set of antecedents than the groupthink model, among these are group type, leader power, organizational political norms etc.

[[File:Ggps schematic.jpg|Ggps schematic]]{{or|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="ggps_model" /&gt;

===Elements of the GGPS model===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
====Antecedents====

Three sets of [[Antecedent_(logic)|antecedents]] are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context.

=====Decision characteristics=====
Elements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics.

''Examples'': whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced.

=====Group structure=====
Elements are cohesiveness, members’ homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group.

''Examples'': whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it’s unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of  mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other’s ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes.

=====Decision making context=====
Elements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat.

''Examples'': whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision-making process. Members’ political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered.

====Emergent group characteristics====

The model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes.

=====Group Perceptions=====
These include members’ perceptions of the group’s vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups.

=====Group Processes=====
These include the group’s response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, [[self-censorship]], and use of [[mindguard]]s.

====Decision process characteristics====

Decision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information).

=====Problem identification=====
Elements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition.

''Example'': if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem.

=====Alternative generation=====
Elements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives.

''Example'': in generating alternatives, it’s important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas.

=====Evaluation and choice=====
Elements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information.

''Example'': whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable.

====Outcomes====

The GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes.

'''''Decision outcomes''''': include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality.

''Example'': if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it.

'''''Political outcomes''''': include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group.

''Example'': if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future.

'''''Affective outcomes''''': include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision.

''Example'': whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group’s future functioning.

A '''knowledge arena''' is a virtual space where individuals can manipulate [[concept]]s and relationships to form a [[concept map]]. Individuals using a computer with appropriate software can represent concepts and the relationships between concepts in a node-relationship-node formalism. The process of thinking about the concepts and making associations between them has been called "off-loading" by McAleese.&lt;ref&gt;McAleese, R ( 1988) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: reflection in action, ''Interactive Learning Environments'', 6,1,1&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[concept map]] is a form of  a semantic network or semantic graph. It is formally based on [[graph theory]]. In the concept map, concepts are represented by nodes. The relationship between nodes are represented by ''typed links'' or ''edges''.  (See [[Graph theory]].) In creating a map or graphic representation of what is known an individual intentionally interacts with the graphical interface or map and through a reflective process adds nodes (concepts) and /or adds relationships (edges or typed links) or modifies existing node-relationship-node instances. It is likely that the process of engaging with concepts and relationships between concepts brings about the creation of understandings as well as making the understandings explicit.

Many different claims have been made for the utility of the [[concept map]]. The interactive and reflective nature of map creation is highlighted by the use of the description Knowledge Arena. Although maps may represent what an individual knows at a point in time; it is likely that by interacting with the concepts and relationships in the knowledge arena individual continues to create and modify what that individual ''knows''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

'''Literal and figurative language''' is a distinction within some fields of [[language]] analysis, in particular [[Stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[semantics]]. 
*'''Literal language''' uses words exactly according to their conventionally accepted [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s or [[denotation]].
*'''Figurative''' (or '''non-literal''') '''language''' uses words in a way that deviates from their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complicated meaning or heightened effect.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/figure%20of%20speech Figure of speech]." ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''. Merriam-Webster, Inc. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative language is often created by presenting words in such a way that they are equated, compared, or associated with normally unrelated meanings.

Literal usage confers meaning to words, in the sense of the meaning they have by themselves, outside any figure of speech.&lt;ref name="JaszczoltTurner2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaszczolt|first1=Katarzyna M..|last2=Turner|first2=Ken|title=Meaning Through Language Contrast.

[[Aristotle]] and later the Roman [[Quintilian]] were among the early analysts of [[rhetoric]] who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|DUPLICATE_title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&amp;pg=PA129|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=9780495898023|edition=10|author1=M.H. Abrams|author2=Geoffrey Harpham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769, [[Frances Brooke]]'s novel ''The History of Emily Montague'' was used in the earliest ''Oxford English Dictionary'' citation for the figurative sense of ''literally''; the sentence from the novel used was, "He is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival; it is literally ''to feed among the lilies''."&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"&gt;[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5914]&lt;/ref&gt; This citation was also used in the OED's 2011 revision.&lt;ref name="languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu"/&gt;

Within literary analysis, such terms are still used; but within the fields of cognition and linguistics, the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used.&lt;ref name="BarberStainton2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Alex|last2=Stainton|first2=Robert J|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Philosophy of Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2boGE2NKtpsC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=2009-11-20|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080965000|pages=230–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figurative language in literary analysis==

[[Allusion]] is a reference to a famous character or event.
: Example: A single step can take you through the looking glass if you're not careful.

An [[idiom]] is an expression that has a figurative meaning unrelated to the literal meaning of the phrase.
:Example: You should keep your eye out for him.
:To keep an eye out for someone means to watch out for them.

A [[pun]] is an expression intended for a humorous or rhetorical effect by exploiting different meanings of words.
: Example: I wondered why the ball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.
: "Then it hit me." has two different meanings

==Standard pragmatic model of comprehension==
Prior to the 1980s, the "standard pragmatic" model of comprehension was widely believed. In that model, it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal, but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made, the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension.&lt;ref name="Katz1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Albert N.|title=Figurative Language and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSxhb_fZLx0C&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195109634|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research has cast doubt on the model. In tests, figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language; and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eysenck|first1=Michael William|last2=Keane|first2=Mark T.|title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22ZWi-LVLDcC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=20 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781841693590|pages=369–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reddy and contemporary views==
Beginning with the work of [[Michael Reddy (linguist)|Michael Reddy]] in his 1979 work "[[Conduit metaphor|The Conduit Metaphor]]", many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a "literal" and "figurative" mode of language.&lt;ref name="Ortony1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ortony|first=Andrew|title=Metaphor and Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJRvuXA_VcC&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=1993-11-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521405614|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], the '''marginal factor cost''' (MFC) is the increment to total costs paid for a [[factor of production]] resulting from a one-unit increase in the amount of the factor employed. It is expressed in [[currency]] units per incremental unit of a factor of production (input), such as [[labour economics|labor]], per unit of time. In the case of the labor input, for example, if the wage rate paid is unaffected by the  number of units of labor hired, the marginal factor cost is identical to the [[wage]] rate. However, if hiring another unit of labor drives up the wage rate that must be paid to all existing units of labor employed, then the marginal cost of the labor factor is higher than the wage rate paid to the last unit because it also includes the increment to the rates paid to the other units.

Thus for any factor the MFC is the change in total amount paid for all units of that factor divided by the change in the quantity of that factor employed.

A firm that wants to optimize its profits hires each factor up to the point at which its marginal factor cost equals its [[marginal revenue product]] (MFC=MRP).

==Definition==
The [[marginal product]] of a [[factor of production]] is generally defined as the change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.

The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (''Y'') per unit change in labor (''L''). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta Y} {\Delta L}.&lt;/math&gt;

In continuous terms, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first [[derivative]] of the [[production function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial Y} {\partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Perloff173"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphically, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the production function.

==Examples==
[[File:Marginal Product of Labor1 copy.png|frame|right|Marginal product of labor table (EDIT: Marginal Product of Labor at Labor = 7 is 4 not 3)]]

There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called [[increasing marginal returns]]. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not [[scale (social sciences)|scale]]d properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as [[diminishing marginal returns]]. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as [[negative marginal returns]].

==Marginal costs==

The marginal product of labor is directly related to [[Cost-of-production theory of value|costs of production]]. [[Cost]]s are divided between [[Fixed cost|fixed]] and [[variable cost]]s. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], or ''rK'', where ''r'' is the rental cost of capital and ''K'' is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or ''wL'', where ''w'' is the wage rate and ''L'' is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases:  ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor  (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor

:MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;
:∆VC = w∆L;
:∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Therefore MC = w ∕ MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;==

The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or ''Q/L''.&lt;ref name="Perloff173"/&gt; The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, ''Intermediate Microeconomics'', Thomson 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W., ''Microeconomic Theory'', 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is shaped like an inverted “u”. At low production levels the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reaches its maximum value  AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, ''Microeconomics with Calculus'', 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; falls.

During the early stages of production MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Eventually the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is still above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will continue to increase until MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is below AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease.

Graphically, the ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"/&gt; The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (which is the slope of the total product curve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Microeconomics|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429277914|authorlink=Paul Krugman|author2=Robin Wells |authorlink2=Robin Wells (economist) |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; equals the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (the slope of the secant).&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' declines. The MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve intersects the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve from above at the maximum point of the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Thereafter, the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is below the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve.

==Diminishing marginal returns==

The falling MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, "as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline."&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"&gt;Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, ''Managerial Economics'', 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.&lt;ref name="Varian1992"&gt;[[Hal Varian]], ''Microeconomic Analysis'', 3rd ed. Norton 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Perloff178"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and profit maximization==

The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal costs. The [[profit maximization]] issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage "up to the point where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;A firm maximizes profits where Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; That is, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆TR/∆L. MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

*Derivation:
:MR = ∆TR/∆Q
:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L
:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

===Example===

*Assume that the production function is &lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"/&gt;
	•	&lt;math&gt; MC_L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;

	•	Output price is $40 per unit.
:&lt;math&gt; MP_L = 90 - 2L &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 3600 - 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = MC_L &lt;/math&gt; (Profit Max Rule)
:&lt;math&gt; 3600 - 80L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 3570 = 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt;
:44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2024.86 &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units
	•	And the profit is
:&lt;math&gt; TR - TC = \Pi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 40(2025) - 30(2025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 81,000 - 60,750 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 20,250 &lt;/math&gt;

* Some might be confused by the fact that &lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt; as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour.

==Marginal productivity ethics==

In the aftermath of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, a number of economists including [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] such as [[Frank Knight]] (in ''The Ethics of Competition'') and the [[Austrian School]], such as [[Leland Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1663&amp;chapter=37668&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Can a Liberal Be an Equalitarian?

Yeager - Toward Liberty: Essays in Honor of Ludwig von Mises, vol. 2 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1971-09-29 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by [[George Stigler]].

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal profit''' is the difference between the [[marginal revenue]] and the [[marginal cost]]. Under the [[Profit maximization#Marginal cost-marginal revenue method|marginal approach to profit maximization]], to maximize profits, a firm should continue to produce a good or service up to the point where marginal profit is zero.

The most simple formula of Marginal profit is: Marginal revenue - Marginal cost. The derivate of the profit f(x) is in fact MP. In other words: p(x)=R(x)-C(x).</text>

The '''marginal propensity to import''' ('''MPI''') is the fractional change in [[imports|import]] expenditure that occurs with a change in [[disposable income]] (income after taxes and transfers).  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to import is 0.2, then the household will spend 20 cents of that dollar on imported goods and services.

Mathematically, the marginal propensity to import (MPM) function is expressed as the [[derivative]] of the import (I) function with respect to disposable income (Y).&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MPM}=\frac{\text{d}I}{\text{d}Y}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, the marginal propensity to import is measured as the ratio of the change in imports to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1.  

Imports are also considered to be [[automatic stabiliser]]s that work to lessen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].

The UK government assumes that UK citizens have a high marginal propensity to import and thus will use a decrease in disposable income as a tool to control the current account on the balance of payments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic.

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

In [[logic]], '''negation''', also called the '''logical complement''', is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] that takes a [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to another proposition "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", written &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (¬P), which is interpreted intuitively as being true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, and false when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. Negation is thus a unary (single-argument) [[logical connective]]. It may be applied as an operation on [[notion (philosophy)|notions]], [[proposition]]s, [[truth value]]s, or [[interpretation (logic)|semantic values]] more generally. In [[classical logic]], negation is normally identified with the [[truth function]] that takes ''truth'' to ''falsity'' and vice versa. In [[intuitionistic logic]], according to the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
No agreement exists as to the possibility of defining negation, as to its logical status, function, and meaning, as to its field of applicability..., and as to the interpretation of the negative judgment, (F.H. Heinemann 1944).&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite book |last=Horn |first=Laurence R |year=2001 |title=A NATURAL HISTORY OF NEGATION |url=http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-natural-history-of-negation-Laurence-R.-Horn.pdf |location=Stanford University |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1 |publisher=CLSI Publications |isbn=1-57586-336-7  |accessdate=29 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Classical negation'' is an  [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' when its operand is false and a value of ''false'' when its operand is true.  So, if statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "not P") would therefore be false; and conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be true.

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \neg P &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| True || False
|-
| False || True
|}

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical consequence]] and &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is [[False_(logic)|absolute falsehood]]). Conversely, one can define &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Q \land \neg Q&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical conjunction]]). The idea here is that any [[contradiction]] is false.  While these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in [[paraconsistent logic]], where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical disjunction]].

Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] in a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a [[Heyting algebra]]. These algebras provide a [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|semantics]] for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these variants are the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="text-align:center" | Notation
! Plain Text
! Vocalization
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;
| ¬p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\mathord{\sim} p&lt;/math&gt;
| ~p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;-p&lt;/math&gt;
| -p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | N''p''
|
| En ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt;
| p'
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' prime,
 | ''p'' complement
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\overline{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| ̅p
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' bar,
 | Bar ''p''
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;!p&lt;/math&gt;
| !p
| {{unbulleted list
 | Bang ''p''
 | Not ''p''
 }}
|-
|}

The notation N''p'' is [[Polish_notation#Polish_notation_for_logic|Łukasiewicz notation]].

In [[Set theory#Basic concepts and notation|set theory]] &lt;math&gt;\setminus&lt;/math&gt; is also used to indicate 'not member of': &lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all members of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that are not members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

No matter how it is notated or [[List of logic symbols|symbolized]], the negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", "not that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", or usually more simply as "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;".

==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of [[classical logic]], double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in symbolic terms, &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;. In [[intuitionistic logic]], a proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of period two.

However, in [[intuitionistic logic]] we do have the equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \neg P \equiv \neg P&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as [[Double-negation translation|Glivenko's theorem]].

===Distributivity===

[[De Morgan's laws]] provide a way of [[Distributive property|distributing]] negation over [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] :

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denote the logical [[Exclusive or|xor]] operation. In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is one such that:

If there exists &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth-value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] a self dual function is one such that:

&lt;math&gt;f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \neg f(\neg a_1, \dots, \neg a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

==Rules of inference==
There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a [[natural deduction]] setting is to take as primitive rules of inference ''negation introduction'' (from a derivation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to both &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), ''negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''ex falso quodlibet''), and ''double negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the rule says that from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction ([[conditional proof]]) and elimination ([[modus ponens]]). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ''ex falso quodlibet''.

==Programming==
As in mathematics, negation is used in [[computer science]] to construct logical statements.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    if (!(r == t))
    {
         /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The "&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;" signifies logical NOT in [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C Programming Language|C]], and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]. "&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;" is the operator used in [[ALGOL 60]], [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and [[Seed7]]. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like [[PL/I]] and [[Ratfor]] use &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; for negation. Some modern computers and [[operating systems]] will display &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; on files encoded in [[ASCII]]. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from &lt;code&gt;if (!(r == t))&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;if (r != t)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also ''bitwise negation''. This takes the value given and switches all the [[binary numeral system|binary]] 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.  See [[bitwise operation]].  This is often used to create [[signed number representations|ones' complement]] or "&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;" in C or C++ and [[two's complement]] (just simplified to "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because "&lt;code&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt;" yields true)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            return -x;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

To demonstrate logical negation:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (!(x &lt; 0))
            return x;
        else
            return -x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

This convention occasionally surfaces in written speech, as computer-related [[slang]] for ''not''.  The phrase &lt;code&gt;!voting&lt;/code&gt;, for example, means "not voting".

==Kripke semantics==
In [[Kripke semantics]] where the semantic values of formulae are sets of [[possible world]]s, negation can be taken to mean [[set-theoretic complement]]ation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (See also [[possible world semantics]].)

In [[finance]], '''negative amortization''' (also known as '''NegAm''', '''deferred interest''' or '''[[Graduated payment mortgage loan|graduated payment mortgage]]''') occurs whenever the loan payment for any period is less than the interest charged over that period so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases.  As an [[amortization]] method the shorted amount (difference between interest and repayment) is then added to the total amount owed to the lender. Such a practice would have to be agreed upon before shorting the payment so as to avoid default on payment.  This method is generally used in an introductory period before loan payments exceed interest and the loan becomes self-amortizing. The term is most often used for [[mortgage loan]]s; corporate loans with negative amortization are called [[PIK loan]]s.

Amortization refers to the process of paying off a debt (often from a loan or mortgage) through regular payments. A portion of each payment is for interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance. The percentage of interest versus principal in each payment is determined in an [[amortization schedule]].

==Defining characteristics==
Negative amortization only occurs in loans in which the periodic payment does not cover the amount of interest due for that loan period. The unpaid [[accrued interest]] is then capitalized monthly into the outstanding principal balance. The result of this is that the loan balance (or principal) increases by the amount of the unpaid interest on a monthly basis.  The purpose of such a feature is most often for advanced cash management and/or more simply payment flexibility, but not to increase overall affordability.

Neg-Ams also have what is called a recast period, and the recast principal balance cap is in the U.S. based on Federal and State legislation. The recast period is usually 60 months (5 years). The recast principal balance cap (also known as the "neg am limit") is usually up to a 25% increase of the amortized loan balance over the original loan amount. States and lenders can offer products with lesser recast periods and principal balance caps; but cannot issue loans that exceed their state and federal legislated requirements under penalty of law.

A newer loan option has been introduced which allows for a 40-year loan term. This makes the minimum payment even lower than a comparable 30-year term.

==Special cases==

* '''[[Reverse mortgage]]''': In the extreme or limiting case of the principle of negative amortization, the borrower in a loan does not need to make payments on the loan until the loan comes due; that is, all interest is capitalized, and the original principal and all interest accrued as of the due date are paid off together and at once.  The most common context in which this arrangement occurs is that of using residential single-family real estate as collateral for the loan, in which case the loan is known as a [[reverse mortgage]].  In the United States of America, the terms of reverse mortgages are heavily regulated by federal law, which as of January 2016 places a lower age limit on the set of permitted borrowers and requires that the mortgage come due only when the borrower no longer uses the property in question as his/her principal residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hecm/rmtopten.cfm Reverse Mortgages - Top Ten Things to Know - HUD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; usually due to the borrower's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the specificity of the reverse-mortgage concept and the limited context in which the term appears in practice, most United States authorities use the term "negative amortization" to denote those and only those loans in which the borrower pays throughout the lifetime of the loan but during and only during its early stages, known as the negative-amortization or "NegAm" period, makes what are in effect partial payments, namely payments lower than the amount of interest accrued during the payment term.

==Typical circumstances==
All NegAM home loans eventually require full repayment of principal and interest according to the original term of the mortgage and note signed by the borrower.  Most loans only allow NegAM to happen for no more than 5 years, and have terms to "Recast" (see below) the payment to a fully amortizing schedule if the borrower allows the principal balance to rise to a pre-specified amount.

This loan is written often in high cost areas, because the monthly mortgage payments will be lower than any other type of financing instrument.

Negative amortization loans can be high risk loans for inexperienced investors.  These loans tend to be safer in a falling rate market and riskier in a rising rate market.

Start rates on negative amortization or minimum payment option loans can be as low as 1%. This is the payment rate, not the actual interest rate. The payment rate is used to calculate the minimum payment. Other minimum payment options include 1.95% or more.

==Adjustable rate feature==
NegAM loans today are mostly straight [[adjustable rate mortgage]]s (ARMs), meaning that they are fixed for a certain period and adjust every time that period has elapsed; e.g., one month fixed, adjusting every month.  The NegAm loan, like all adjustable rate mortgages, is tied to a specific financial index which is used to determine the interest rate based on the current index and the margin (the [[Markup (business)|markup]] the lender charges).  Most NegAm loans today are tied to the Monthly Treasury Average, in keeping with the monthly adjustments of this loan.  There are also Hybrid ARM loans in which there is a period of fixed payments for months or years, followed by an increased change cycle, such as six months fixed, then monthly adjustable.

The '''[[Graduated payment mortgage loan|graduated payment mortgage]]''' is a "fixed rate" NegAm loan, but since the payment increases over time, it has aspects of the ARM loan until amortizing payments are required.

The most notable differences between the traditional payment option ARM and the hybrid payment option ARM are in the start rate, also known as the "minimum payment" rate.  On a Traditional Payment Option Arm, the minimum payment is based on a principal and interest calculation of 1% - 2.5% on average.

The start rate on a hybrid payment option ARM is higher, yet still extremely competitive payment wise.

On a hybrid payment option ARM, the minimum payment is derived using the "interest only" calculation of the start rate.  The start rate on the hybrid payment option ARM typically is calculated by taking the fully indexed rate (actual note rate), then subtracting 3%, which will give you the start rate.

Example:   7.5% fully indexed rate − 3% = 4.5%  (4.5% would be the start rate on a hybrid pay option ARM)

This guideline can vary among lenders.

Aliases the payment option ARM loans are known by:
* PayOption ARM 
* Negative Amortizing Loan  (Neg Am)
* Pick - A - Pay
* Deferred interest option loan  (this is the way this loan was introduced to the mortgage industry when first created)

==Mortgage terminology==
* Cap
: Percentage rate of change in the NegAm payment.  Each year, the minimum payment due rises.  Most minimum payments today rise at 7.5%.   Considering that raising a rate 1% on a mortgage at 5% is a 20% increase, the NegAm can grow quickly in a rising market.  Typically after the 5th year, the loan is recast to an adjustable loan due in 25 years. This is for a 30 year loan term. Newer payment option loans often offer a 40 year term with a higher underlying interest rate.
* Life cap
: The maximum interest rate allowed after recast according to the terms of the note.  Generally most NegAm loans in the last 5 years have a life cap of 9.95%.  Today many of these loans are capped at 12% or above.
(In general Author is using time references that are relative to a time frame that is not defined. 'Today' which is?; 'last 5 years' from when, etc.)
* Index
: The variable, such as the [[Cost of funds index|COFI]]; COSI; CODI or often MTA, which determines the adjustment as an increase or decrease in the interest rate. Other examples include the LIBOR and TREASURY.
* Margin
: Often disclosed in the adjustable rate rider of a Deed of Trust, the margin is determined by the lender and is used to calculate the interest rate.  Often the loan originator can increase the margin when structuring the product for the borrower.  An increase to the margin will also increase the borrower's interest rate, but will improve the [[yield spread premium]] which the loan originator may receive as compensation from the lender.
* Fully indexed rate (F.I.R.)
: The fully indexed rate is the sum of the margin and the current index value at the time of adjustment. The F.I.R. is the "interest rate" and determines the interest only, 30 year and 15 year amortized payments.  Most adjustable rate products have caps on rate adjustments.  If the note provides for a single adjustment not to exceed an increase by more than 1.5, and the variable index, for example, increased by 2.5 since the last adjustment, the fully indexed rate will top out at a maximum adjustment of 1.5, as stated in the note, for that particular adjustment period.  Often the F.I.R. is used to determine the debt to income ratio when qualifying a borrower for this loan product.
* Payment options
: There are typically 4 payment options (listed from highest to lowest):
:* 15 year payment
:** Amortized over a period of 15 years at the F.I.R.
:* 30 year payment
:** Amortized over a period of 30 years at the F.I.R.
:* Interest only payment
:** F.I.R. times the principal balance, divided by 12 months (with no amortization or reduction in the owed balance).
:* Minimum payment
:** Based on the minimal start rate determined by the lender.  When paying the minimum payment, the difference between the interest only payment and the minimum payment is deferred to the balance of the loan increasing what is owed on the mortgage.
* Period
: How often the NegAm payment changes.  Typically, the minimum payment rises once every twelve months in these types of loans.  Usually the rate of rise is 7.5%.  The F.I.R. is subject to adjusting with the variable Index, most often on a monthly basis, depending on the product.
* Recast
: Premature stop of NegAm.  Should the balance increase to a predetermined amount (from 110% up to 125% of the original balance per federal or state regulations) the loan will be "recast" with one of two payment options: the fully amortized principal and interest payment, or if the maximum balance has been reached before the fifth year, an interest only payment until the loan has matured to the recast date (typically 5 years).
* Stop
: End of NegAm payment schedule.

==Criticisms==
Negative-amortization loans, being relatively popular only in the last decade, have attracted a variety of criticisms:
* Unlike most other adjustable-rate loans, many negative-amortization loans have been advertised with either teaser or artificial, introductory interest rates or with the minimum loan payment expressed as a percentage of the loan amount.  For example, a negative-amortization loan is often advertised as featuring "1% interest", or by prominently displaying a 1% number without explaining the F.I.R.  This practice has been done by large corporate lenders.  This practice has been considered deceptive for two different reasons:  most mortgages do not feature [[teaser rate]]s, so consumers do not look out for them; and, many consumers aren't aware of the negative amortization side effect of only paying 1% of the loan amount per year.  In addition, most negative amortization loans contain a clause saying that the payment may not increase more than 7.5% each year, ''except'' if the 5-year period is over or if the balance has grown by 15%.  Critics say this clause is only there to deceive borrowers into thinking the payment could only jump a small amount, whereas in fact the other two conditions are more likely to occur.
* Negative-amortization loans as a class have the highest potential for what is known as payment shock.  Payment shock is when the required monthly payment jumps from one month to the next, potentially becoming unaffordable.  To compare various mortgages' payment-shock potential (note that the items here do not include escrow payments for insurance and taxes, which can cause changes in the payment amount):
** 30-year (or 15-year) fixed-rate fully amortized mortgages: no possible payment jump.
** 5-year adjustable-rate fully amortized mortgage: No payment jump for 5 years, then a possible payment decrease or increase based on the new interest rate.
** A 10-year interest only mortgage product, recasting to a 20-year amortization schedule (after ten years of interest-only payments) could see a payment increase of up to $600 on a balance of 330K.
** Negative amortization mortgage: no payment jump either until 5 years OR the balance grows 15% (depending on the product) higher than the original amount.  The payment increases, by requiring a full interest-plus-principal payment.  The payment could further increase due to interest-rate changes.  However, all things being equal, the fully amortized payment is almost triple the negatively amortized payment.
** First month free: a loan officer may allow the borrower to skip the first monthly payment on a refinance loan, by simply adding that payment to the principal and charging [[compound interest]] on it for many years.  The borrower may not understand or question the transaction.

In a very hot real estate market a buyer may use a negative-amortizing mortgage to purchase a property with the plan to sell the property at a higher price before the end of the "negam" period.  Therefore, an informed investor could purchase several properties with minimal monthly obligations and make a great profit over a five-year plan in a rising real-estate market.

However, if the property values decrease, it is likely that the borrower will owe more on the property than it is worth, known colloquially in the mortgage industry as "being underwater". In this situation, if the property owner cannot make the new monthly payment, he or she may be faced with foreclosure or having to refinance with a very high [[loan-to-value ratio]], requiring additional monthly obligations, such as mortgage insurance, and higher rates and payments due to the adversity of a high loan-to-value ratio.

It is very easy for borrowers to ignore or misunderstand the complications of this product when being presented with minimal monthly obligations that could be from one half to one third what other, more predictable, mortgage products require.

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Negative campaigning''' or '''mudslinging''' is the process of deliberate spreading negative information about someone or something to worsen the [[public relations|public image]] of the described.

Deliberate spreading of such information can be motivated either by honest desire of the campaigner to warn others against real dangers or deficiencies of the described, or by the campaigner's dishonest ideas on methods of  winning in political, business or other spheres of competition against an honest rival.

The public image of an entity can be defined as [[reputation]], esteem, [[respect]], acceptance of the entity's appearance, [[values]] and behaviour by the general public of a given territory and/or a [[social group]], possibly within time limits. As target groups of public and their values differ, so negativity or positivity of a public image is relative: e.g. while in most societies having an honest source of income is a positive value and stealing is discouraged,  in the world of professional thieves honest work is frowned upon and stealing is encouraged. In [[polygamous]] societies [[monogamy]] is not viewed in the way it is valued in monogamous societies. Values of a society also change with time: e.g. homosexuality in [[Western culture]] was considered immoral and was [[Homosexuality#Legality|criminally prosecuted]] until the [[sexual revolution]] of the second half of the 20 century.
Thus negative campaigning to be successful has to take into account current values of the group it addresses. The degree of strictness in practicing the group's values as opposed to its tolerance for violating the norms has also to be taken into consideration: e.g. while in the [[Old Testament]] and other traditional religious societies [[adultery]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed and supposed to be punished by death, modern Western societies show much greater tolerance to these.

In [[United States politics]], negative campaigning has been called "as [[American way of life|American]] as Mississippi mud" and "as American as apple pie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The modern presidential campaign: Mudslinging, bombast, and the vitality of American politics|last = Scher|first = R. K.|publisher = M. E. Sharpe|year = 1997|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests negative campaigning is the norm in all political venues, mitigated only by the dynamics of a particular contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/seminars/russian5.pdf|title=The Rational Attacker in Russia? Negative Campaigning in Russian Presidential Elections|doi=10.1111/1468-2508.00117|jstor=2691664|author1=Lee Sigelman|author2=Eric Shiraev|journal=The Journal of Politics|year=2002|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

There are a number of techniques used in negative campaigning.  Among the most effective is running [[advertisement]]s attacking an opponent's personality, record, or opinion.  There are two main types of ads used in negative campaigning: attack and contrast.

Attack ads focus exclusively on the negative aspects of the opponent.  There is no positive content in an attack ad, whether it is about the candidate or the opponent.  Attack ads usually identify the risks associated with the opponent, often exploiting people’s fears to manipulate and lower the impression voters have of the opponent.  Because attack ads have no positive content, they have the potential to be more influential than contrast ads in shaping voters’ views of the sponsoring candidate’s opponent.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"&gt;Fridkin, K. L., &amp; Kenney, P. J. (2004). Do Negative Messages Work?: The Impact of Negativity on Citizens’ Evaluations of Candidates. American Politics Research, 32(570), 570–602. {{doi|10.1177/1532673X03260834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike attack ads, contrast ads contain information about both the candidate and the opponent.  The information about the candidate is positive, while the information about the opponent is negative.  Contrast ads compare and contrast the candidate with the opponent, juxtaposing the positive information about the candidate with the negative information of the opponent.  Because contrast ads must contain positive information, contrast ads are seen as less damaging to the political process than attack ads.&lt;ref name="Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2004"/&gt;

One of the most famous such ads was ''[[Daisy (television commercial)|Daisy Girl]]'' by the campaign of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] that successfully portrayed Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] as threatening [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Common negative campaign techniques include painting an opponent as soft on criminals, dishonest, corrupt, or a danger to the nation. One common negative campaigning tactic is attacking the other side for running a negative campaign.

Dirty tricks are also common in negative political campaigns. These generally involve secretly leaking damaging information to the media. This isolates a candidate from backlash and also does not cost any money. The material must be substantive enough to attract media interest, however, and if the truth is discovered it could severely damage a campaign. Other dirty tricks include trying to feed an opponent's team false information hoping they will use it and embarrass themselves.

Often a campaign will use outside organizations, such as [[lobbying|lobby groups]], to launch attacks. These can be claimed to be coming from a neutral source and if the allegations turn out not to be true the attacking candidate will not be damaged if the links cannot be proven. Negative campaigning can be conducted by proxy. For instance, highly partisan ads were placed in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] by allegedly independent bodies like [[MoveOn.org]] and [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].

[[Push poll]]s are attacks disguised as [[Robo call#Political calls|telephone polls]]. They might ask a question like "How would you react if Candidate A was revealed to beat his wife?", giving the impression that Candidate A might beat his wife. Members of the media and of the opposing party are deliberately not called making these tactics all but invisible and unprovable.

[[G. Gordon Liddy]] played a major role in developing these tactics during the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign playing an important advisory of rules that led to the [[campaign of 1972]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[James Carville]], campaign manager of [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1992 election, is also a major proponent of negative tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Lee Atwater]], best known for being an advisor to presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H.W. Bush]], also pioneered many negative campaign techniques seen in political campaigns today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/opinion/20sat3.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Political Legacy of Baaad Boy Atwater | first=Eleanor | last=Randolph | date=September 20, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sponsors of overt negative campaigns often cite reasons to support [[mass communication]] of negative ideas. The [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] uses negative campaigns to steer the public away from health risks. Similar negative campaigns have been used to rebut mass marketing by [[tobacco companies]], or to discourage [[drunk driving]]. Those who conduct negative political campaigns sometimes say the public needs to know about the person he or she is voting for, even if it is bad. In other words, if a candidate’s opponent is a crook or a bad person, then he or she should be able to tell the public about it.

[[Martin Wattenberg (political scientist)|Martin Wattenberg]] and [[Craig Brians]], of the University of California, Irvine, considered in their study whether negative campaigning mobilizes or alienates voters. They concluded that data used by [[Stephen Ansolabehere]] in a 1994 American Political Science Review article to advance the hypothesis that negative campaigning demobilizes voters was flawed.

A subsequent study done by Ansolabehere and [[Shanto Iyengar]] in 1995&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"&gt;Ansolabehere, S. &amp; Iyengar, S. (1995). Going negative: How campaign advertising shrinks and polarizes the electorate. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; corrected some of the previous study's flaws. This study concluded that negative advertising suppressed voter turnout, particularly for Independent voters. They speculated that campaigns tend to go negative only if the Independent vote is leaning toward the opponent. In doing so, they insure that the swing voters stay home, leaving the election up to base voters. They also found that negative ads have a greater impact on Democrats than on Republicans. According to them, base Republicans will vote no matter what (and will vote only for a Republican), but Democrats can be influenced to either stay home and not vote at all or to switch sides and vote for a Republican. This, combined with the effect negativity has on Independents, led them to conclude that Republicans benefit more from going negative than Democrats.

Other researchers have found different, more positive outcomes from negative campaigns. [[Rick Farmer]], PhD, an assistant professor of political science at the [[University of Akron]] found that negative ads are more memorable than positive ads when they reinforce a preexisting belief and are relevant to the central issues of a marketing campaign. Researchers at the [[University of Georgia]] found the impact of negative ads increases over time, while positive ads used to counteract negative ads lack the power of negative ads&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622031838/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DTI/is_11_32/ai_n8569068 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-06-22 |title=Sock it to 'em: can a negative marketing campaign have positive results?

Most recently, [[Kyle Mattes]] and [[David P. Redlawsk]] in ''The Positive Case for Negative Campaigning'' show through surveys and experiments that negative campaigning provides informational benefits for voters. Without negativity, voters would not have full information about all of their choices, since no candidate will say anything bad about herself. They argue that candidates have to point out the flaws in their opponents for voters to be fully informed.

== Risks and consequences ==
Some strategists say that an effect of negative campaigning is that while it motivates the base of support it can alienate centrist and undecided voters from the political process, reducing [[voter turnout]] and radicalizing politics.&lt;ref name="Ansolabehere, S. 1995"/&gt; 
In a study done by Gina Garramone about how negative advertising affects the political process, it was found that a consequence of negative campaigning is greater image discrimination of the candidates and greater attitude polarization.  While positive ads also contributed to the image discrimination and attitude polarization, Garramone found that negative campaigning played a more influential role in the discrimination and polarization than positive campaigning.&lt;ref name="Garramone 1990"&gt;Garramone, G. M., Atkin, C. K., Pinkleton, B. E., &amp; Cole, R. T. (1990, Summer). Effects of Negative Political Advertising on the Political Process. Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media, 34(3), 299–311. {{doi|10.1080/08838159009386744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative ads can produce a backlash. A [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|disastrous ad]] was run by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 Canadian federal election]], apparently emphasizing [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]]'s [[Bell's Palsy]] partial facial paralysis in a number of unflattering photos, with the subtext of criticizing his platforms. Chrétien took maximum advantage of the opportunity to gain the public's sympathy as a man who struggled with a physical disability and his party's subsequent overwhelming victory in the election helped reduce the governing Conservatives to two seats.

A similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] for running an [[2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads|attack ad]] that suggested that [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] leader [[Stephen Harper]] would use Canadian soldiers to patrol Canadian cities, and impose some kind of martial law. The ad was only available from the Liberal Party's web site for a few hours prior to the release of the attack ads on television; nevertheless, it was picked up by the media and widely criticized for its absurdity, in particular the sentence "we're not making this up; we're not allowed to make this stuff up". Liberal MP Keith Martin expressed his disapproval of "whoever the idiot who approved that ad was," shortly before Liberal leader Paul Martin (no relation) stated that he had personally approved them. The effect of the ads was to diminish the credibility of the party's other attack ads. It offended many Canadians, particularly those in the military, some of whom were fighting in [[Afghanistan]] at the time.  (See [[Canadian federal election, 2006]])

More recently, in the 2008 US Senate race in [[North Carolina]], Republican incumbent [[Elizabeth Dole]] attempted an attack ad on Democratic challenger [[Kay Hagan]], who had taken a small lead in polls, by tying her to [[atheists]]. Dole's campaign released an ad questioning Hagan's religion and it included a voice saying "There is no God!" over a picture of Kay Hagan's face. The voice was not Hagan's but it is believed the ad implied that it was. Initially, it was thought the ad would work as religion has historically been a very important issue to voters in the American south, but the ad produced a backlash across the state and Hagan responded forcefully with an ad saying that she was a Sunday school teacher and was a religious person. Hagan also claimed Dole was trying to change the subject from the economy (the ad appeared around the same time as the [[2008 financial crisis]]). Hagan's lead in polls doubled and she won the race by a nine-point margin.

Because of the possible harm that can come from being seen as a negative campaigner, candidates often pledge to refrain from negative attacks. This pledge is usually abandoned when an opponent is perceived to be "going negative," with the first retaliatory attack being, ironically, an accusation that the opponent is a negative campaigner.

While some research has found advantages and other has found disadvantages, some studies find no difference between negative and positive approaches&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325013318/http://americandemocracy.nd.edu/working_papers/documents/Arceneaux_Nickerson_Negative_Messages.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in the Journal of Advertising found that negative political advertising makes the body want to turn away physically, but the mind remembers negative messages. The findings are based on research conducted by James Angelini, professor of communication at the [[University of Delaware]], in collaboration with Samuel Bradley, assistant professor of advertising at [[Texas Tech University]], and Sungkyoung Lee of [[Indiana University]], which used ads that aired during the 2000 presidential election. During the study, the researchers placed electrodes under the eyes of willing participants and showed them a series of 30-second ads from both the [[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]] campaigns. The electrodes picked up on the "startle response," the automatic eye movement typically seen in response to snakes, spiders and other threats. Compared to positive or neutral messages, negative advertising prompted greater reflex reactions and a desire to move away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/545187/ Viewers Are Repulsed by Negative Campaign Ads] Newswise, Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative cutting'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Case|first=Dominic|title=Film Technology in Post Production|publisher=CRC Press, 2012|isbn= 9781136049774}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''negative matching''' and '''negative conforming''') is the process of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the [[film editor]]. [[Original camera negative]] (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a [[film splicer]] and [[film cement]]. Negative cutting is part of the [[post-production]] process and occurs after editing and prior to striking [[internegative]]s and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process.  Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on [[keykode]].

Toward the late 1990s and early 2000s negative cutting changed due to the advent of [[digital cinema]] technologies such as [[digital intermediate]] (DI), digital projection and [[high-definition television]]. In some countries, due to the high cost of online suites, negative cutting is still used for commercials by reducing footage. Increasingly feature films are bypassing the negative cutting process altogether and are being scanned directly from the uncut [[Dailies|rushes]].

The existence of [[digital intermediate]]s (DI) has created a new demand for negative cutters to extract [[selected takes]] which are cut from the [[Dailies|rushes]] and re-spliced into new rolls (in edit order) to reduce the volume of footage for scanning.

== Basic ==
After a film shoot, the [[original camera negative]] (OCN) is sent to a film laboratory for processing. Two or three {{convert|400|ft|m|sing=on}} camera rolls are spliced together to create a lab roll approximately {{convert|1200|-|1500|ft|m|abbr=on}} long. After developing the lab roll, it is put through a [[telecine]] to create a [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape. This [[Dailies|rushes]] transfer tape is of lower quality than film and is used for editing purposes only.

The [[Dailies|rushes]] tape is sent to the Editor who loads it into an offline edit suite. The lab rolls are sent to the negative cutter for logging and storage.

After the Editor finishes the Edit it is exported to an offline [[edit decision list|EDL list]] and the EDL list is sent to the negative cutter. The negative cutter will translate the Timecode in the EDL list to edge numbers ([[keykode]]) using specially designed negative cutting software to find which shot is needed from the [[Juncaceae|rushes]] negative.

Traditionally a negative cutter would then fine cut the negative to match the Editor's final edit frame accurately. Negative would be spliced together to create rolls less than {{convert|2000|ft|m}} which would then be sent to the film laboratory to print release prints.

Today most feature films are extracted full takes (as [[selected takes]]) and scanned digitally as a [[digital intermediate]]. Television series and commercials shot on film follow the same extraction process but are sent for [[telecine]]. Each required shot is extracted from the lab roll as a full take and [[Film splicer|respliced]] together to create a new selected roll of negative. This reduces the negative required by up to 1/10 of the footage shot, saving considerable time during scanning or telecine. The negative cutter will create a new Online EDL list replacing the [[Dailies|rushes]] roll timecode with the new selected roll timecode.

In the case of feature films the selected roll and Online EDL are sent to a post production facility for scanning as a [[digital intermediate]]. For television commercials or series the selected takes and EDL are sent to a post production facility for re-telecine and compiled in an Online Suite for final grading.

== Software ==

There have been a number of dedicated software systems that have been developed for and by negative cutters to manage the process of cutting motion picture negative. A number of individual proprietary software systems have been developed starting in the early 1980s. Stan Sztaba developed a system for World Cinevision Services Inc (New York) in 1983 using Apple II DOS and then [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], this system is still used today. Elliott Gamson of Immaculate Matching (New York) developed a system using [[MS-DOS]]. Computamatch was one of the first [[MS-DOS]]-based systems developed and is still in use today in several countries.

The first commercially available software product was OSC/R (pronounced "Oscar"), a DOS-based application developed in Toronto, Canada by The Adelaide Works. OSC/R was very widely used and at the time was the only negative cutting software on the market until Adelaide Works ceased operation in 1993. OSC/R is still used today in some negative cutting facilities but has been mostly replaced by newer and more advanced systems. Excalibur was a later Windows 98 based product developed by FilmLab Engineering in Britain. Film Fusion is one of the most recent developments and is a Windows XP and Vista based system developed in Sydney, Australia by Popsoft IT.

== Hardware ==

Negative cutters use various hardware tools such as film [[Synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizers]], re-winders, [[film splicer]]s, scissors, [[film cement]] and film keykode readers. [[DigiSync]], a purpose built keykode reader is used by most negative cutters in conjunction with software for logging the keykode from film. [[DigiSync]] was developed by [[Research In Motion]] and in 1998 it won a Technical Achievement Academy Award for the design and development of the [[DigiSync]] Film Keykode Reader. [[Research In Motion]] later moved on to bigger things and invented the [[BlackBerry]] Wireless Email Phone and is now a publicly listed company. Other brands of  barcode scanners are also in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31935">In [[theoretical physics]], '''negative mass''' is matter whose [[mass]] is of opposite sign to the mass of normal matter, e.g. −1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/negative-mass-object-washington-state-physics-isaac-newton-upside-down-a7693701.html "Scientists observe liquid with 'negative mass', which turns physics completely upside down"], ''The Independent'', April 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fluid-negative-mass-1.4073937 "Scientists create fluid that seems to defy physics:'Negative mass' reacts opposite to any known physical property we know"], ''CBC'', April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such matter would violate one or more [[energy condition]]s and show some strange properties, stemming from the ambiguity as to whether attraction should refer to force or the oppositely oriented acceleration for negative mass. It is used in certain speculative [[hypothesis]], such as on the construction of traversable [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Initially, the closest known real representative of such exotic matter is a region of [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

[[General relativity]] describes [[gravity]] and the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] for both positive and [[negative energy]] particles, hence negative mass, but does not include the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]]. On the other hand, the [[Standard Model]] describes [[elementary particle]]s and the other fundamental forces, but it does not include gravity. A unified theory that explicitly includes gravity along with the other fundamental forces may be needed for a better understanding of the concept of negative mass.

==In general relativity==
Negative mass is any region of space in which for some observers the mass density is measured to be negative. This could occur due to a region of space in which the stress component of the Einstein [[stress–energy tensor]] is larger in magnitude than the mass density. All of these are violations of one or another variant of the positive [[energy condition]] of Einstein's general theory of relativity; however, the positive energy condition is not a required condition for the mathematical consistency of the theory.

===Inertial versus gravitational mass===

Ever since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] first formulated his theory of [[gravity]], there have been at least three conceptually distinct quantities called [[mass]]:
*[[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass ''m'' that appears in Newton's second law of motion, '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;thinsp;'''a'''
*“active” [[gravitational mass]] &amp;ndash; the mass that produces a gravitational field that other masses respond to 
*“passive” gravitational mass &amp;ndash; the mass that responds to an external gravitational field by accelerating.

Einstein’s [[equivalence principle]] postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] requires that active and passive gravitational mass be identical. All experimental evidence to date has found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative mass, it is important to consider which of these concepts of mass are negative. In most analyses of negative mass, it is assumed that the equivalence principle and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of mass are still the same.

In his 4th-prize essay for the 1951 [[Gravity Research Foundation]] competition, [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger]] considered the possibility of negative mass and how it would behave under gravitational and other forces.&lt;ref name="Luttinger 1951"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luttinger |first=J. M. |year=1951 |title=On "Negative" mass in the theory of gravitation |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5852e579be659442a01f27b8/t/5873dc04d1758eea4b41c720/1483987972731/luttinger.pdf |journal=Awards for Essays on Gravitation |publisher=Gravity Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, following Luttinger's idea, [[Hermann Bondi]] suggested in a paper in ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' that mass might be negative as well as positive.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.423 |title=Negative Mass in General Relativity |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=423 |year=1957 |last1=Bondi |first1=H. |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..423B }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that this does not entail a logical contradiction, as long as all three forms of mass are negative, but that the assumption of negative mass involves some counter-intuitive form of motion. For example, an object with negative inertial mass would be expected to accelerate in the opposite direction to that in which it was pushed (non-gravitationally).

There have been several other analyses of negative mass, such as the studies conducted by R. M. Price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=R. M.|title=Negative mass can be positively amusing|journal=Am. J. Phys.|date=1993|volume=61|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1119/1.17293 |url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ccline/courses/resources/wp/pdf/AJP000216.pdf|bibcode = 1993AmJPh..61..216P }}&lt;/ref&gt; however none addressed the question of what kind of energy and momentum would be necessary to describe non-singular negative mass. Indeed, the Schwarzschild solution for negative mass parameter has a naked singularity at a fixed spatial position. The question that immediately comes up is, would it not be possible to smooth out the singularity with some kind of negative mass density. The answer is yes, but not with energy and momentum that satisfies the [[Energy condition#Dominant energy condition|dominant energy condition]]. This is because if the energy and momentum satisfies the dominant energy condition within a spacetime that is asymptotically flat, which would be the case of smoothing out the singular negative mass Schwarzschild solution, then it must satisfy the positive energy theorem, i.e. its [[ADM formalism|ADM mass]] must be positive, which is of course not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shoen|first1=R.|last2=Yao|first2=S.-T.|title=On the proof of the positive mass conjecture in general relativity|journal=Commun.

===Runaway motion===
Although no particles are known to have negative mass, physicists (primarily [[Hermann Bondi]] in 1957,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; [[William B. Bonnor]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00763458| title = Negative mass in general relativity| journal = General Relativity and Gravitation| volume = 21| issue = 11| pages = 1143| year = 1989| last1 = Bonnor | first1 = W. B.|bibcode = 1989GReGr..21.1143B }}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Robert L. Forward]]&lt;ref name="Forward 1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2514/3.23219| title = Negative matter propulsion| journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power| volume = 6| pages = 28| year = 1990| last1 = Forward | first1 = R. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have been able to describe some of the anticipated properties such particles may have. Assuming that all three concepts of mass are equivalent the gravitational interactions between masses of arbitrary sign can be explored, based on the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[equivalence principle]]:

* Positive mass attracts both other positive masses and negative masses.
* Negative mass repels  both other negative masses and positive masses.

For two positive masses, nothing changes and there is a gravitational pull on each other causing an attraction. Two negative masses would repel because of their negative inertial masses. For different signs however, there is a push that repels the positive mass from the negative mass, and a pull that attracts the negative mass towards the positive one at the same time.

Hence Bondi pointed out that two objects of equal and opposite mass would produce a constant acceleration of the system towards the positive-mass object,&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt; an effect called "runaway motion" by Bonnor who disregarded its physical existence, stating: 
{{Centered pull quote
 |I regard the runaway (or self-accelerating) motion […] so preposterous that I prefer to rule it out by supposing that inertial mass is all positive or all negative.
|author= William B. Bonnor
|source=in ''Negative mass in general relativity''.&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;}}

Such a couple of objects would accelerate without limit (except relativistic one); however, the total mass, momentum and energy of the system would remain 0.

This behavior is completely inconsistent with a common-sense approach and the expected behaviour of 'normal' matter; but is completely mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. If the masses are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then the momentum of the system remains zero if they both travel together and accelerate together, no matter what their speed:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{sys} = mv + (-m)v = \big(m+(-m)\big)v = 0\times v = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

And equivalently for the [[kinetic energy]]:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k,sys} = \tfrac12 mv^2 + \tfrac12(-m)v^2 = \tfrac12\big(m+(-m)\big)v^2 = \tfrac12(0)v^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, this is perhaps not exactly valid if the energy in the gravitational field is taken into account.

Forward extended Bondi's analysis to additional cases, and showed that even if the two masses {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(−)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;}} are not the same, the conservation laws remain unbroken. This is true even when relativistic effects are considered, so long as inertial mass, not rest mass, is equal to gravitational mass.

This behaviour can produce bizarre results: for instance, a gas containing a mixture of positive and negative matter particles will have the positive matter portion increase in [[temperature]] without bound. However, the negative matter portion gains negative temperature at the same rate, again balancing out. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] pointed out other implications of Forward's analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G.|last= Landis|title=Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion|journal=J. Propulsion and Power|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= 304 |year=1991|doi=10.2514/3.23327}}&lt;/ref&gt; including noting that although negative mass particles would repel each other gravitationally, the [[electrostatic force]] would be attractive for like [[charge (physics)|charges]] and repulsive for opposite charges.

Forward used the properties of negative-mass matter to create the concept of diametric drive, a design for [[spacecraft propulsion]] using negative mass that requires no energy input and no [[Working mass|reaction mass]] to achieve arbitrarily high acceleration.

Forward also coined a term, "nullification", to describe what happens when ordinary matter and negative matter meet: they are expected to be able to cancel out or nullify each other's existence. An interaction between equal quantities of positive mass matter (hence of positive energy {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and negative mass matter (of negative energy {{math|−''E'' {{=}} −''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) would release no energy, but because the only configuration of such particles that has zero momentum (both particles moving with the same velocity in the same direction) does not produce a collision, all such interactions would leave a surplus of momentum, which is classically forbidden. So once this runaway phenomenon has been revealed, the [[scientific community]] considered negative mass could not exist in the universe.

===Arrow of time and energy inversion===
In 1970, [[Jean-Marie Souriau]] demonstrated, through the complete [[Poincaré group]] of dynamic [[group theory]], that reversing the energy of a particle (hence its mass, if the particle has one) is equal to reversing its [[arrow of time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |date=1970 |title=Structure des Systèmes Dynamiques |trans-title=Structure of Dynamic Systems |url=http://www.jmsouriau.com/structure_des_systemes_dynamiques.htm |location=Paris |publisher=Dunod |page=199 |language=French |issn=0750-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Souriau |first=J.-M. |title=Structure of Dynamical Systems |chapter=A mechanistic description of elementary particles: Inversions of space and time |location=Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-4612-6692-1 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0281-3_14 |url=http://ayuba.fr/souriau/Souriau-time-energy-mass-inversion.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe according to [[general relativity]] is a [[Riemannian manifold]] associated to a [[metric tensor]] solution of Einstein’s field equations. In such a framework, the runaway motion prevents the existence of negative matter.&lt;ref name="Bondi 1957" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonnor 1989" /&gt;

Some [[bimetric theory|bimetric theories]] of the universe propose that two [[multiverse|parallel universes]] instead of one may exist with an opposite arrow of time, linked together by the [[Big Bang]] and interacting only through [[gravitation]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov 1980"&gt;A.D.

The coupled metrics have their own [[geodesic]]s and are solutions of two coupled field equations:&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-2106-5 |title=Negative mass hypothesis in cosmology and the nature of dark energy |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=354 |issue=2 |pages=611 |year=2014 |last1=Petit |first1=J.

The [[Post-Newtonian expansion|Newtonian approximation]] then provides the following interaction laws:
* Positive mass attracts positive mass.
* Negative mass attracts negative mass.
* Positive mass and negative mass repel each other.
Those laws are different to the laws described by Bondi and Bonnor, and solve the runaway paradox. The negative matter of the coupled metric, interacting with the matter of the other metric via gravity, could be an alternative candidate for the explanation of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] and [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name="Petit 2014a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Petit 2014b" /&gt;

===In Gauss's law of gravity===
In [[electromagnetism]] one can derive the energy density of a field from [[Gauss's law]], assuming the curl of the field is 0. Performing the same calculation using [[Gauss's law for gravity]] produces a negative energy density for a gravitational field.

===Gravitational interaction of antimatter===
{{Main|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}
The overwhelming consensus among physicists is that [[antimatter]] has positive mass and should be affected by gravity just like normal matter. Direct experiments on neutral [[antihydrogen]] have not been sensitive enough to detect any difference between the gravitational interaction of antimatter, compared to normal matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2787 |pmid=23653197 |pmc=3644108 |title=Description and first application of a new technique to measure the gravitational mass of antihydrogen |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1785 |year=2013 |last1=Amole |first1=C. |last2=Ashkezari |first2=M.

[[Bubble chamber]] experiments provide further evidence that antiparticles have the same inertial mass as their normal counterparts. In these experiments, the chamber is subjected to a constant magnetic field that causes charged particles to travel in [[Helix|helical]] paths, the radius and direction of which correspond to the ratio of electric charge to inertial mass. Particle–antiparticle pairs are seen to travel in helices with opposite directions but identical radii, implying that the ratios differ only in sign; but this does not indicate whether it is the charge or the inertial mass that is inverted. However, particle–antiparticle pairs are observed to electrically attract one another. This behavior implies that both have positive inertial mass and opposite charges; if the reverse were true, then the particle with positive inertial mass would be repelled from its antiparticle partner.

==Experimentation==
Physicist Peter Engels and a team of colleagues at [[Washington State University]] claimed to have observed negative mass behavior in rubidium atoms. On 10 April 2017 Engels team created negative "effective" mass by reducing the temperature of rubidium atoms to near [[absolute zero]], generating a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. By using a laser-trap, the team were able to reverse the spin of some of the rubidium atoms in this state, and observed that once released from the trap, the atoms expanded and displayed properties of negative mass, in particular accelerating towards a pushing force instead of away from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39642992|title=Physicists observe 'negative mass'|date=2017-04-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301 |pmid=28452531 |title=Negative-Mass Hydrodynamics in a Spin-Orbit–coupled Bose–Einstein Condensate |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=118 |issue=15 |pages=155301 |year=2017 |last1=Khamehchi |first1=M. A. |last2=Hossain |first2=Khalid |last3=Mossman |first3=M. E. |last4=Zhang |first4=Yongping |last5=Busch |first5=Th. |last6=Forbes |first6=Michael Mcneil |last7=Engels |first7=P. |bibcode=2017PhRvL.118o5301K |arxiv=1612.04055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This kind of negative effective mass is analogous to the well-known apparent negative effective mass of electrons in the upper part of the dispersion bands in solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N. W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N. D.|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Saunders College|location=Philadelphia|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither case is negative mass for the purposes of the [[stress–energy tensor]].

Some recent work with [[metamaterial]]s suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered composite of superconductors, metamaterials and normal matter could exhibit signs of negative effective mass in much the same way as low temperature alloys melt at below the melting point of their components or some semiconductors have negative differential resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2014.10.036 |title=Novel negative mass density resonant metamaterial unit cell |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=379 |pages=33 |year=2015 |last1=Cselyuszka |first1=Norbert |last2=Sečujski |first2=Milan |last3=Crnojević-Bengin |first3=Vesna |bibcode=2015PhLA..379...33C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In quantum mechanics==
In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]]'s theory of [[elementary particle]]s, now part of the [[Standard Model]], already included negative solutions.&lt;ref name="Dirac 1928"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0023 |title=The Quantum Theory of the Electron |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences |volume=117 |issue=778 |pages=610 |year=1928 |last1=Dirac |first1=P. A. M. |bibcode=1928RSPSA.117..610D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Standard Model]] is a generalization of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and negative mass is already built into the theory.

[[Mike Morris (physicist)|Morris]], [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] and Yurtsever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |pmid=10038800 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael S. |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the quantum mechanics of the [[Casimir effect]] can be used to produce a locally mass-negative region of space–time. In this article, and subsequent work by others, they showed that negative matter could be used to stabilize a [[wormhole]]. Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by negative-mass loops of [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/9409051 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3117 |title=Natural wormholes as gravitational lenses |journal=Physical Review D |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=3117 |year=1995 |last1=Cramer |first1=John G. |last2=Forward |first2=Robert L. |last3=Morris |first3=Michael S. |last4=Visser |first4=Matt |last5=Benford |first5=Gregory |last6=Landis |first6=Geoffrey A. |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.3117C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] has proved that [[negative energy]] is a necessary condition for the creation of a [[closed timelike curve]] by manipulation of gravitational fields within a finite region of space;&lt;ref name="futureofspacetime"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawking | first = Stephen | title = The Future of Spacetime | publisher = W. W. Norton |year= 2002 | pages = 96 | isbn = 0-393-02022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this proves, for example, that a finite [[Tipler cylinder]] cannot be used as a [[Time travel|time machine]].

===Schrödinger equation===
For energy eigenstates of the [[Schrödinger equation]], the wavefunction is wavelike wherever the particle's energy is greater than the local potential, and exponential-like (evanescent) wherever it is less. Naively, this would imply kinetic energy is negative in evanescent regions (to cancel the local potential). However, kinetic energy is an operator in [[quantum mechanics]], and its expectation value is always positive, summing with the expectation value of the potential energy to yield the energy eigenvalue.

For wavefunctions of particles with zero rest mass (such as [[photon]]s), this means that any evanescent portions of the wavefunction would be associated with a local negative mass–energy. However, the Schrödinger equation does not apply to massless particles; instead the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] is required.

==In special relativity==
{{See also|Exotic matter|Faster-than-light}}
One can achieve a negative mass independent of [[negative energy]]. According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass {{mvar|m}} is in proportion to energy {{mvar|E}} and the coefficient of proportionality is {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Actually, {{mvar|m}} is still equivalent to {{mvar|E}} although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wang, Z.Y, Wang P.Y, Xu Y.R.| date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham–Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22| bibcode=2011Optik.122.1994W | arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as {{math|−''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E&amp;=-mc^2&gt;0 \\
m&amp;= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances,

:&lt;math&gt;dE=F\,ds=\frac{dp}{dt}\,ds=\frac{ds}{dt}\,dp=v\,dp=v\,d(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}} is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}}. The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

From the above relation,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], the [[inverse Doppler effect]] and the [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the force is defined as {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}. [[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy–momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck–Einstein relation]] {{math|''E'' {{=}} ''ħω''}} and [[de Broglie]]'s {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_\mathrm{p}^2\,, \quad \left(E_0=\hbar\omega_\mathrm{p}=-m_0c^2&gt;0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy–momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt; ([[wave–particle duality]]) and can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&lt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&lt;c \\
\frac{\omega_\mathrm{p}^2}{\omega^2}&amp;&gt;2\,, \quad\mbox{when }v&gt;c
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_\mathrm{k} &amp;= E-E_0 \\
&amp;=-mc^2-\left(-m_0 c^2\right) \\
&amp;=-\frac{m_0c^2}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} + m_0 c^2 \\
&amp;= m_0 c^2 \left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\right)&lt;0\,, \quad \left(\mbox{where }m_0&lt;0\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell|first=R. R.|title=A phantom menace?

A '''negative repetition''' ('''negative rep''') is the repetition of a technique in [[weight training|weight lifting]] in which the lifter performs the eccentric phase of a lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Eccentric Weight Training|url = http://weighttraining.about.com/od/glossary/g/eccentric.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pressing the weight up slowly, in proper form, a [[Spotting (weight training)|spotter]] generally aids in the concentric, or lifting, portion of the repetition while the lifter slowly performs the eccentric phase for 3–6 seconds. Negative reps are used to improve both [[Physical strength|muscular strength]] and power in subjects, this is commonly known as hypertrophy training.

Due to its mechanical properties, this form of training can be used for both healthy individuals and individuals who are in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that negative repetitions or "[[Eccentric training|eccentric phase training]]" combines a high amount of force on the muscle with a lower energy cost than normal concentric training, which requires 4–5 times the amount of energy. This justifies why this type of training is more beneficial and less of a risk to subjects rehabilitating or with a limited exercise capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Eccentric+Exercise+Training%3A+Modalities%2C+Applications+and+Perspectives&amp;rft.jtitle=Sports+Medicine&amp;rft.au=Marie-Eve+Isner-Horobeti&amp;rft.au=St%C3%A9phane+Pascal+Dufour&amp;rft.au=Philippe+Vautravers&amp;rft.au=Bernard+Geny&amp;rft.date=2013-06-01&amp;rft.pub=Springer+Science+%26+Business+Media&amp;rft.issn=0112-1642&amp;rft.eissn=1179-2035&amp;rft.volume=43&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=483&amp;rft.externalDocID=3141405021&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Eccentric exercise training: modalities, applications and perspectives|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0052-y|pmid = |access-date = |volume=43 |pages=483–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eccentric training is often associated with the terms "muscles soreness" and "muscle damage". In 1902, [[Theodore Hough]] discovered and developed the term DOMS ([[delayed onset muscle soreness]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/doms-the-good-the-bad-and-what-it-really-means-to-your-training|title = DOMS: the good, the bad and what it really means to your training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he found that exercises containing negative repetitions caused athletes to have sore muscles. Hough believed this was causing a rupture within the muscle; when he looked further into the subject, he found that when performing eccentric exercise that exhibited soreness, the muscle "quickly adapts and becomes accustomed to the increase in applied stress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mc.uky.edu/athletic_training/docs/nzsmsc-2010/Eccentric_Training_Spring2011.pdf|title = Eccentric training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this was that the muscles' soreness not only decreased, but the muscular damage did too.

== Health benefits for the elderly ==
It has been proven that eccentric resistance training improves the functional mobility of older adults. Studies have shown that eccentric training of the lower body, in particular the [[:Category:Knee extensors|knee extensors]], are essential in preventing falls in older adults and helping them maintain their independence. A study conducted focusing on eccentric training for the age group 65–87 years of age showed that, over 12 weeks, they had strengthened their knee extensors by up to 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Aging%2C+functional+capacity+and+eccentric+exercise+training&amp;rft.jtitle=Aging+and+disease&amp;rft.au=Gault%2C+Mandy+L&amp;rft.au=Willems%2C+Mark+E+T&amp;rft.date=2013&amp;rft.eissn=2152-5250&amp;rft.volume=4&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=351&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/24307968&amp;rft.externalDocID=24307968&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Aging, Functional Capacity and Eccentric Exercise Training|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that negative repetitions can help improve the health of older adults.

== Treatment of Tendinopathy ==
Studies have shown that eccentric training may be successful in the treatment of certain [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]]. Studies have shown that the use of eccentric training for twelve weeks may be an alternative to therapy for people suffering from [[Patellar tendinitis|Patellar Tendinopathy]] (Jumper's Knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surgical Treatment Compared with Eccentric Training for Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee)|url = http://jbjs.org/content/88/8/1689|journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|date = 2006-08-01|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0021-9355|pmid = 16882889|pages = 1689–1698|volume = 88|issue = 8|doi = 10.2106/JBJS.E.01181|first = Roald|last = Bahr|first2 = Bjørn|last2 = Fossan|first3 = Sverre|last3 = Løken|first4 = Lars|last4 = Engebretsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric training has also been proven successful in the treatment of chronic [[Achilles tendinitis|Achilles tendonitis]], using a twelve-week eccentric calf muscle program various studies have shown the ability for people to return to normal pre-tendonitis levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic Achilles tendon pain treated with eccentric calf-muscle training|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|journal = Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|date = 2003-08-26|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0942-2056|pages = 327–333|volume = 11|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|first = Martin|last = Fahlström|first2 = Per|last2 = Jonsson|first3 = Ronny|last3 = Lorentzon|first4 = Håkan|last4 = Alfredson|pmid=12942235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x/epdf|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x/epdf|accessdate = 2015-04-16 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x|volume=11|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports|pages=197–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning behind the benefits of eccentric training for tendinopathy is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Clinical improvement after 6 weeks of eccentric exercise in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy – a randomized trial with 1-year follow-up |url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|journal = Scand J Med Sci Sports|access-date = 2015-04-16|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|volume=14|pages=286–295|pmid=15387802|date=October 2004 | last1 = Roos | first1 = EM | last2 = Engström | first2 = M | last3 = Lagerquist | first3 = A | last4 = Söderberg | first4 = B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===

  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">Nearly 78 years have passed since Paul L. Dysart, Jr. invented the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume Index indicators. The indicators remain useful to identify primary market trends and reversals.

In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume. He called the cumulative series for the days when volume had been greater than the prior day's volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI), and the series for the days when volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI).

A native of Iowa, Dysart worked in Chicago's LaSalle Street during the 1920s. After giving up his [[Chicago Board of Trade]] membership, he published an advisory letter geared to short-term trading using advance-decline data. In 1933, he launched the ''Trendway'' weekly stock market letter and published it until 1969 when he died. Dysart also developed the 25-day Plurality Index, the 25-day total of the absolute difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues, and was a pioneer in using several types of volume of trading studies. Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letters, in his January 7, 1976 letter called Dysart "one of the most brilliant of the pioneer market technicians."

==Dysart’s NVI and PVI==
The daily volume of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the NYSE Composite Index's advances and declines drove Dysart's indicators. Dysart believed that “volume is the driving force in the market.” He began studying market breadth numbers in 1931, and was familiar with the work of Leonard P. Ayres and James F. Hughes, who pioneered the tabulation of advances and declines to interpret stock market movements.

Dysart calculated NVI as follows: 1) if today's volume is less than yesterday's volume, subtract declines from advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading for the days when volume is greater than the prior day's volume. He calculated PVI in the same manner but for the days when volume was greater than the prior day's volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly.

Initially, Dysart believed that PVI would be the more useful series, but in 1967, he wrote that NVI had “proved to be the most valuable of all the breadth indexes.” He relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, the acronym of “'''A''' '''M'''easure '''O'''f '''M'''ajor '''E'''conomic '''T'''rend.”

Dysart's theory, expressed in his 1967 Barron's article, was that “if volume advances and prices move up or down in accordance [with volume], the move is assumed to be a good movement - if it is sustained when the volume subsides.” In other words, after prices have moved up on positive volume days, "if prices stay up when the volume subsides for a number of days, we can say that such a move is 'good'." If the market “holds its own on negative volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.”

He called PVI the “majority” curve. Dysart distinguished between the actions of the “majority” and those of the “minority.” The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority. When the majority showed an appetite for stocks, the PVI was usually “into new high ground” as happened in 1961.

It is said that the two indicators assume that "smart" money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index picks out days when the volume is lower than on the previous day, and the positive index picks out days with a higher volume.

==Dysart’s Interpretation of NVI and PVI==
Besides an article he wrote for Barron's in 1967, not many of Dysart's writings are available. What can be interpreted about Dysart's NVI is that whenever it rises above a prior high, and the DJIA is trending up, a “Bull Market Signal” is given. When the NVI falls below a prior low, and the DJIA is trending down, a “Bear Market Signal” is given. The PVI is interpreted in reverse.
However, not all movements above or below a prior NVI or PVI level generate signals, as Dysart also designated “bullish” and “bearish penetrations.” These penetrations could occur before or after a Bull or Bear Market Signal, and at times were called “reaffirmations” of a signal. In 1969, he articulated one rule: “signals are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.” Dysart cautioned that “there is no mathematical system devoid of judgment which will continuously work without error in the stock market.”

According to Dysart, between 1946 and 1967, the NVI “rendered 17 significant signals,” of which 14 proved to be right (an average of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 wrong (average loss of 6.33%). However, NVI “seriously erred” in 1963-1964 and in 1968, which concerned him. In 1969, Dysart reduced the weight he had previously given to the NVI in his analyses because NVI was no longer a “decisive” indicator of the primary trend, although it retained an “excellent ability to give us ‘leading’ indications of short-term trend reversals.”

A probable reason for the NVI losing its efficacy during the mid-1960s may have been the steadily higher NYSE daily volume due to the dramatic increase in the number of issues traded so that prices rose on declining volume. Dysart’s NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that period.
Norman G. Fosback has attributed the “long term increase in the number of issues traded” as a reason for a downward bias in a cumulative advance-decline line. Fosback was the next influential technician in the story of NVI and PVI.

==Fosback’s Variations==
Fosback studied NVI and PVI and in 1976 reported his findings in his classic Stock Market Logic. He did not elucidate on the indicators’ background or mentioned Dysart except for saying that “in the past Negative Volume Indexes have always [his emphasis] been constructed using advance-decline data….” He posited, “There is no good reason for this fixation on the A/D Line. In truth, a Negative Volume Index can be calculated with any market index - the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500, or even ‘unweighted’ market measures.... Somehow this point has escaped the attention of technicians to date.”

The point had not been lost on Dysart, who wrote in Barron’s, “we prefer to use the issues-traded data [advances and declines] rather than the price data of any average because it is more all-encompassing, and more truly represents what’s happening in the entire market.” Dysart was a staunch proponent of using advances and declines.

Fosback made three variations to NVI and PVI:

1. He cumulated the daily percent change in the market index rather than the difference between advances and declines. On negative volume days, he calculated the price change in the index from the prior day and added it to the most recent NVI. His calculations are as follows:

If C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closing prices of today and yesterday, respectively, the NVI for today is calculated by

* adding NVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's NVI if today's volume is lower than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise,

and the PVI is calculated by:

* adding PVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's PVI if today's volume is higher than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise.

2. He suggested starting the cumulative count at a base index level such as 100.

3. He derived buy or sell signals by whether the NVI or PVI was above or below its one-year moving average.

Fosback's versions of NVI and PVI are what are popularly described in books and posted on Internet financial sites. Often reported are his findings that whenever NVI is above its one-year [[moving average (finance)|moving average]] there is a 96% (PVI - 79%) probability that a bull market is in progress, and when it is below its one-year moving average, there is a 53% (PVI - 67%) probability that a bear market is in place. These results were derived using a 1941-1975 test period. Modern tests might reveal different probabilities.

Today, NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is forgotten. It cannot be said that one version is better than the other. While Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of these indicators, Dysart's versions offer value to identify primary trends and short-term trend reversals.

Although some traders use Fosback's NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, the indicators were created to track, and have been tested, on major market indexes. NVI was Dysart's most invaluable breadth index, and Fosback found that his version of “the Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.” Traders can benefit from both innovations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

A '''polar concept argument''' is a type of [[argument]] that posits the understanding of one concept, from the mere understanding of its [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]]. A well-known instance of a polar concept argument is [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s argument against scepticism (1960). According to Anthony Grayling's characterisation, Ryle's argument can be stated as follows:

:''There cannot be counterfeit coins, (...) unless there are genuine ones, nor crooked paths unless there are straight paths, nor tall men unless there are short men''.

According to Ryle's polar concept argument, counterfeit and genuine coins come in pairs, and one cannot conceive of counterfeit coins without also capturing the essence of the genuine coins at the same time. When one grasps the essence of one polar concept, one also grasps immediately the essence of its polar opposite. Ryle's original argument (1960) runs as follows:

:''A country which had no coinage would offer no scope to counterfeiters. There would be nothing for them to manufacture or pass counterfeits of. They could, if they wished, manufacture and give away decorated disks of brass or lead, which the public might be pleased to get. But these would not be false coins. There can be false coins only where there are coins made of the proper materials by the proper authorities. In a country where there is a coinage, false coins can be manufactured and passed; and the counterfeiting might be so efficient that an ordinary citizen, unable to tell which were false and which were genuine coins, might become suspicious of the genuineness of any particular coin that he received.''

A polar concept argument bears on some more or less strong version of [[dialectical monism]], a philosophical doctrine that views reality as a unified whole, due to the complementarity of [[polar concepts]].

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Positive and Negative Affect Schedule''' ('''PANAS''') is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both [[Positive affectivity|positive]] and [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]]. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 ''(not at all)'' to 5 ''(very much)''. The measure has been used mainly as a research tool in group studies, but can be utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations as well.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=John R.|last2=Henry|first2=Julie D.|title=The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS): Construct validity, measurement properties and normative data in a large non-clinical sample|url=http://doi.crossref.org/10.1348/0144665031752934|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=245–265|doi=10.1348/0144665031752934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened, elongated, and children's versions of the PANAS have been developed, taking approximately 5–10 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Clinical and non-clinical studies have found the PANAS to be a reliable and valid instrument in the assessment of positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Clark|first2=Lee A.|last3=Tellegen|first3=Auke|title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and history ==
The PANAS was developed in 1988 by researchers from the University of Minnesota and Southern Methodist University. Previous mood measures have shown correlations of variable strength between positive and negative affect, and these same measures have questionable reliability and validity. Watson, Clark, and Tellegen developed the PANAS in an attempt to provide a better, purer measure of each of these dimensions.

The researchers extracted 60 terms from the factor analyses of Michael Zevon and Tellegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zevon|first=Michael A.|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke|date=1982-07-01|title=The structure of mood change: An idiographic/nomothetic analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/43/1/111|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=43|issue=1|pages=111–122|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.111|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown to be relatively accurate markers of either positive or negative affect, but not both. They chose terms that met a strong correlation to one corresponding dimension but exhibited a weak correlation to the other. Through multiple rounds of elimination and preliminary analyses with a test population, the researchers arrived at 10 terms for each of the two scales, as follows:

== Versions ==

===PANAS-C===
The '''PANAS for Children (PANAS-C)''' was developed in an attempt to differentiate the affective expressions of anxiety and depression in children. The tripartite model on which this measure is based suggests that high levels of negative affect is present in those with anxiety and depression, but high levels of positive affect is not shared between the two. Previous mood scales for children have been shown to reliably capture the former relationship but not the latter; the PANAS-C was created as a tool with better discriminant validity for child assessment. Similar to the development of the original PANAS, the PANAS-C drew from terms of the PANAS-X and eliminated several terms with insufficient correlations between the term and the affective construct after preliminary analyses with a non-clinical sample of children. The final version of the measure consists of 27 items: 12 positive affect terms and 15 negative affect terms. Despite the purpose of its development, however, the measure’s discriminant validity is still wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Alicia A.|last2=Kendall|first2=Philip C.|date=2009-01-14|title=Psychometric Properties of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) in Children with Anxiety Disorders|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=343–352|doi=10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|issn=0009-398X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-SF===
The '''PANAS-SF''',  comprises 10 items that were determined through the highest factor loadings on the exploratory [[factor analysis]] reported by Watson et al. (1988) in his original PANAS. Previous mood scales, such that of Bradburn, had low reliabilities and high correlations between subscales. Watson was able to address these concerns in his study of the original PANAS; however, his participants consisted mostly of student populations. The purpose of the PANAS-SF was not only to provide a shorter and more concise form of the PANAS, but to be able to apply the schedules to older clinical populations. Overall, it was reported that this modified model was consistent with Watson’s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kercher|first=Kyle|date=1992-06-01|title=Assessing Subjective Well-Being in the Old-Old The PANAS as a Measure of Orthogonal Dimensions of Positive and Negative Affect|url=http://roa.sagepub.com/content/14/2/131|journal=Research on Aging|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131–168|doi=10.1177/0164027592142001|issn=0164-0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-PANAS-SF===
Separate from the PANAS-SF,  Edmund Thompson created the international PANAS short form ('''I-PANAS-SF''') in order to make a 10 item mood scale that can be implemented effectively on an international level, provide more clarity on the content of the items, reduce ambiguities, address the limitations of the original and the previous short form of the PANAS, and also to provide a shorter, yet dependable and valid scale. To determine the 10 items of the 20 original items, two focus groups were utilized to evaluate all of the original 20 PANAS items. They found that while some items were easily understood by the participant, certains items had different meanings or were too ambiguous. Items that had too much ambiguity were eliminated from the modified form. Researchers found that the I-PANAS-SF had high correlations with the original PANAS. Through multiple tests and studies, they were able to determine that the I-PANAS-SF was on par with the original scale and can be used as a reliable, valid, brief, and efficient instrument on an international scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Edmund R.|date=2007-03-01|title=Development and Validation of an Internationally Reliable Short-Form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/38/2/227|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-X===
In 1994, Watson and Clark developed an expanded form of the PANAS, called the '''PANAS-X''', that consists of 60 items that can be completed in 10 minutes or less. The PANAS-X incorporates the original, higher order dimensions specified in the PANAS in addition to the measures of 11 lower order emotional states. These measures are broken down into three main categories: basic negative emotion scales consisting of fear, hostility, guilt, and sadness; basic positive emotion scales consisting of joviality, self-assurance, and attentiveness; and other affective states consisting of shyness, fatigue, serenity, and surprise. Through extensive analyses, all eleven affective states, with the exception of surprise, were shown to be stable, valid measures that assess how an individual’s emotional states fluctuate over time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Watson,|last2=Anna|first2=Clark, Lee|date=1999-01-01|title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Many forms of the PANAS (PANAS-C, PANAS-X, I-PANAS-SF, and among others) have shown that the PANAS has been widely employed. Recent studies have also shown that the PANAS can be administered in a large general adult population, as well as other populations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to date, the PANAS is mostly used as a research tool in group studies, but it has the potential to be utilized in clinical work with individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the PANAS has the potential to be used to evaluate mental illnesses, as shown in an experiment conducted by Dyck, Jolly, and Kramer, which demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing between depression and anxiety in clinical samples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

== Limitations ==
Since the PANAS is a self-report questionnaire, it can be difficult to assess people’s mood accurately, as people can overstate or understate their experience of their moods. In addition, the original PANAS had a limited sample size of college students, which concerns with wide applicability to other samples. Furthermore, some studies claim that the PANAS is too long or that its items are redundant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The PANAS does not encompass higher order mood states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1230">The '''principle of distributivity''' states that the algebraic [[distributive law]] is [[Validity (logic)|valid]] for [[classical logic]], where both [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] are distributive over each other so that for any [[proposition]]s ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]]s
:&lt;math&gt;A \land (B \lor C) \iff (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)&lt;/math&gt;
and

hold.

The principle of distributivity is valid in [[classical logic]], but invalid in [[quantum logic]].

In philosophy and rhetoric, the '''principle of humanity''' states that when interpreting another speaker we must assume that his or her beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her "the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]], "Mid-Term Examination," in The Intentional Stance, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of humanity was named by [[Richard Grandy]] (then an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]) who first expressed it in 1973.

The '''product/process distinction''' is the distinction between the product information and the process information of a consumer good. Product information is information that pertains to a consumer good, namely to its price, quality, and safety (its proximate attributes). Process information is information that pertains to the means by which the consumer good is made [[i.e.]] the working conditions under which it comes into being, as well as the treatment of animals involved in its production chain (its peripheral attributes).

The product/process distinction is used by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) as a way to determine whether or not a complaint filed by an importing nation is valid and warrants [[trade barriers]] against the exporting nation. Under WTO rules, an importing nation can lodge a complaint with the WTO that the exporting nation uses methods for obtaining or producing the good in question that the importing nation finds to be immoral or unethical.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} If the independent World Trade Organization Advisory Board, made up of a panel of international law and trade experts, finds that the importing nation has a legitimate complaint, enforces said ethical standards for domestic production, and isn't trying to merely skirt its free trade obligations, then the Board will rule that trade barriers are justified.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Despite what World Trade Organization officials have said, in practice the World Trade Organization finds these complaints illegitimate the vast majority of the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

For example, if the [[European Union]] (EU) wants to ban imports of cosmetics that were tested on laboratory animals on grounds that such testing is unethical, it can file a complaint with the World Trade Organization and, in theory, the WTO would allow the EU to enact trade barriers provided that the EU bans its own domestic cosmetic producers from testing on laboratory animals. 
In these cases, however, the World Trade Organization has consistently ruled that such barriers are illegal because only the process is different, while the final product itself is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KIRK|first1=lisbeth|title=MEPs vote for EU ban on cosmetics tested on animal|url=https://euobserver.com/news/1966|website=euobserver|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the WTO has made the product/process distinction an important factor in determining whether trade barriers are justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howse/Regan|title=The Product/Process Distinction--An Illusory Basis for Disciplining Unilateralism in Trade Policy|url=http://iatp.org/files/ProductProcess_Distinction--An_Illusory_Basis_.htm|website=WTO Paper|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Organization has stated that if nations were able to enact barriers merely because the importing nation's standards differ from their own, control could be lost and barriers could be enacted around the world for frivolous reasons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} However, many complain that these rulings go against the stated intentions of the World Trade Organization, and prove that the organization often puts commercial interests above environmental, ethical, and  human rights issues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''''Rationes seminales''''' ([[Latin]], from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λόγοι σπερματικοὶ'' or ''logoi spermatikoi''), translated variously as germinal or causal principles, primordial reasons, original factors, seminal reasons or virtues, or seedlike principles, is a [[theological]] theory on the origin of species. It is the doctrine that [[God]] created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted ''rationes seminales'', from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing.

The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Neoplatonism]]
.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Helmig,''Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition'', Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea was incorporated into [[Christian]] thought through the writings of authors such as  [[Athenagoras of Athens]], [[Tertullian]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Roger Bacon]], until mostly rejected in the modern period. [[Evolution]], though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories (cf "Man incarnate spirit" by Ramon Lucas Lucas). &lt;ref&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman, ''Neoplatonism and Jewish Thought'',  SUNY Press, (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''rationes seminales'' was also used as an explanation for [[spontaneous generation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">{{distinguish|text=Schwinger's variational principle, ''[[Schwinger variational principle]]''}}

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31232">A '''truth table''' is a [[mathematical table]] used in [[logic]]—specifically in connection with [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[boolean function]]s, and [[propositional calculus]]—which sets out the functional values of logical [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables ([[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]], 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]].

A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, P and Q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, P XOR Q). Each row of the truth table contains one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, P=true Q=false), and the result of the operation for those values. See the examples below for further clarification. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is often credited with inventing the truth table in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] | title = Ludwig Wittgenstein, A Biographical Sketch | journal = The Philosophical Review | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | year = 1955 | pages = 527–545 (p. 532, note 9) | jstor = 2182631 | doi=10.2307/2182631}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it appeared at least a year earlier in a paper on propositional logic by [[Emil Leon Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Emil Post]]|title=Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|date=July 1921|volume=43|issue=3|pages=163–185|jstor= 2370324|doi=10.2307/2370324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unary operations==

There are 4 unary operations:
*Always true
*Never true, unary ''[[falsum]]''
*Unary ''Identity'' 
*Unary ''negation'' 

===Logical true===
The output value is always true, regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical True'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''T''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T ||  T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}
===Logical false===
The output value is never true: that is, always false,  regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical False'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical identity===
[[Identity function|Logical identity]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]] p, for which the output value remains p.

The truth table for the logical identity operator is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Identity'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical negation===
[[Logical negation]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' if its operand is false and a value of ''false'' if its operand is true.

The truth table for '''NOT p''' (also written as '''¬p''', '''Np''', '''Fpq''', or '''~p''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Negation'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''¬p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}


==Binary operations==

There are 16  possible [[truth function]]s of two [[binary variable]]s:

===Truth table for all binary logical operators===
Here is an extended truth table giving definitions of all possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Information about notation may be found in [[Józef Maria Bocheński|Bocheński]] (1959), [[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]] (2001), and [[W. V. Quine|Quine]] (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:T = true.
:F = false.
:The '''Com''' row indicates whether an operator, '''op''', is [[Commutative property|commutative]] - '''P op Q = Q op P'''.
:The '''L id''' row shows the operator's [[left identity|left identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''I op Q = Q'''.
:The '''R id''' row shows the operator's [[right identity|right identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''P op I = P'''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The operators here with equal left and right identities (XOR, AND, XNOR, and OR) are also [[monoid#Commutative_monoid|commutative monoids]] because they are also [[Associative_property|associative]]. While this distinction may be irrelevant in a simple discussion of logic, it can be quite important in more advanced mathematics. For example, in [[category theory]] an [[enriched category]] is described as a base [[category (mathematics)|category]] enriched over a monoid, and any of these operators can be used for enrichment.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The four combinations of input values for p, q, are read by row from the table above.
The output function for each  p, q combination, can be read, by row, from the table.

'''Key:'''

The following table is oriented by column, rather than by row. There are four columns rather than four rows, to display the four combinations of p, q, as input. 

'''p''': T T F F&lt;br&gt;
'''q''': T F T F

There are 16 rows in this key, one row for each binary function of the two binary variables, p, q. For example, in row 2 of this Key, the value of [[Converse nonimplication]] ('&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;') is solely T, for the column denoted by the unique combination p=F, q=T; while  in row 2, the value of that '&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;' operation is F for the three remaining columns of p, q. The output row for &lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt; is thus

2: F F T F

and the 16-row&lt;ref name=tlp5.101/&gt; key is

Logical operators can also be visualized using [[Venn diagram#Overview|Venn diagram]]s.

===Logical conjunction (AND)===
[[Logical conjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are true.

The truth table for '''p AND q''' (also written as '''p ∧ q''', '''Kpq''', '''p &amp; q''', or '''p''' &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; '''q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Conjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∧ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

In ordinary language terms, if both ''p'' and ''q'' are true, then the conjunction ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is true.  For all other assignments of logical values to ''p'' and to ''q'' the conjunction ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'' is false.

It can also be said that if ''p'', then ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''q'', otherwise ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''p''.

===Logical disjunction (OR)===
[[Logical disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p OR q''' (also written as '''p ∨ q''', '''Apq''', '''p || q''', or '''p + q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∨ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

Stated in English, if ''p'', then ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''p'', otherwise ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''q''.

===Logical implication===
Logical implication and the [[material conditional]] are both associated with an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, which produces a value of ''false'' if the first operand is true and the second operand is false, and  a value of ''true'' otherwise.

The truth table associated with the logical implication '''p implies q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''', or more rarely '''Cpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Implication'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⇒ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The truth table associated with the material conditional '''if p then q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Material Conditional '''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' → ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It may also be useful to note that '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''' and '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''' are equivalent to '''¬p&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;q'''.

===Logical equality===
[[Logical equality]] (also known as biconditional) is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both operands are false or both operands are true.

The truth table for '''p XNOR q''' (also written as '''p ↔ q''', '''Epq''', '''p = q''', or '''p ≡ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equality'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↔ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

So p EQ q is true if p and q have the same [[truth value]] (both true or both false), and false if they have different truth values.

===Exclusive disjunction===
[[Exclusive disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if one but not both of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p XOR q''' (also written as '''p ⊕ q''', '''Jpq''', '''p ≠ q''', or '''p ↮ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Exclusive Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⊕ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

For two propositions, '''XOR''' can also be written as (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q).

===Logical NAND===
The [[logical NAND]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''false'' if both of its operands are true.  In other words, it produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is false.

The truth table for '''p NAND q''' (also written as '''p ↑ q''', '''Dpq''', or '''p | q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NAND'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↑ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It is frequently useful to express a logical operation as a compound operation, that is, as an operation that is built up or composed from other operations.  Many such compositions are possible, depending on the operations that are taken as basic or "primitive" and the operations that are taken as composite or "derivative".

In the case of logical NAND, it is clearly expressible as a compound of NOT and AND.

The negation of a conjunction: ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the disjunction of negations: (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:15%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:15%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:15%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:15%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-
| T || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

===Logical NOR===
The [[logical NOR]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of ''false'' if at least one of its operands is true. ↓ is also known as the [[Peirce arrow]] after its inventor, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and is a [[Sole sufficient operator]].

The truth table for '''p NOR q''' (also written as '''p ↓ q''', or '''Xpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"

The negation of a disjunction ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the conjunction of negations (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

Inspection of the tabular derivations for NAND and NOR, under each assignment of logical values to the functional arguments ''p'' and ''q'', produces the identical patterns of functional values for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q''), and for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'').  Thus the first and second expressions in each pair are logically equivalent, and may be substituted for each other in all contexts that pertain solely to their logical values.

This equivalence is one of [[De Morgan's laws]].

==Applications==
Truth tables can be used to prove many other [[logical equivalence]]s.  For example, consider the following truth table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equivalence : &lt;math&gt;(p \Rightarrow q) \equiv (\lnot p \lor q)&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- style="background:paleturquoise"

! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt;
|-

|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T
|}

This demonstrates the fact that &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;.

===Truth table for most commonly used logical operators===
Here is a truth table that gives definitions of the 6 most commonly used out of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Propositions 4.*-5.*|the 16 possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q]]:

|}

where

:T = true
:F = false
:&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conjunction|AND]] (logical conjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical disjunction|OR]] (logical disjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\lor}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive or|XOR]] (exclusive or) &lt;!-- this could be "+" instead according to other articles --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\land}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive nor|XNOR]] (exclusive nor)
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conditional|conditional "if-then"]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; = conditional "then-if"
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[if and only if|biconditional "if-and-only-if"]].

===Condensed truth tables for binary operators===
For binary operators, a condensed form of truth table is also used, where the row headings and the column headings specify the operands and the table cells specify the result. For example, [[Boolean logic]] uses this condensed truth table notation:

{|
|-
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∧ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || F
|-
! T
| F || T
|}
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∨ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || T
|-
! T
| T || T
|}
|}

This notation is useful especially if the operations are commutative, although one can additionally specify that the rows are the first operand and the columns are the second operand. This condensed notation is particularly useful in discussing multi-valued extensions of logic, as it significantly cuts down on combinatoric explosion of the number of rows otherwise needed. It also provides for quickly recognizable characteristic "shape" of the distribution of the values in the table which can assist the reader in grasping the rules more quickly.

===Truth tables in digital logic===
Truth tables are also used to specify the function of [[Lookup table#Hardware LUTs|hardware look-up tables (LUTs)]] in [[Digital circuit|digital logic circuitry]]. For an n-input LUT, the truth table will have 2^''n'' values (or rows in the above tabular format), completely specifying a boolean function for the LUT. By representing each boolean value as a [[bit]] in a [[Binary numeral system|binary number]], truth table values can be efficiently encoded as [[integer]] values in [[Electronic design automation|electronic design automation (EDA)]] [[software]]. For example, a 32-bit integer can encode the truth table for a LUT with up to 5 inputs.

When using an integer representation of a truth table, the output value of the LUT can be obtained by calculating a bit index ''k'' based on the input values of the LUT, in which case the LUT's output value is the ''k''th bit of the integer. For example, to evaluate the output value of a LUT given an [[Array data structure|array]] of ''n'' boolean input values, the bit index of the truth table's output value can be computed as follows: if the ''i''th input is true, let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, else let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''k''th bit of the binary representation of the truth table is the LUT's output value, where &lt;math&gt;k = V_0 \times 2^0 + V_1 \times 2^1 + V_2 \times 2^2 + \dots + V_n \times 2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Truth tables are a simple and straightforward way to encode boolean functions, however given the [[exponential growth]] in size as the number of inputs increase, they are not suitable for functions with a large number of inputs. Other representations which are more memory efficient are text equations and [[binary decision diagram]]s.

===Applications of truth tables in digital electronics===
In digital electronics and computer science (fields of applied logic engineering and mathematics), truth tables can be used to reduce basic boolean operations to simple correlations of inputs to outputs, without the use of [[logic gate]]s or code. For example, a binary addition can be represented with the truth table:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B | C R
1 1 | 1 0
1 0 | 0 1
0 1 | 0 1
0 0 | 0 0

where

A = First Operand
B = Second Operand
C = Carry
R = Result
&lt;/pre&gt;

This truth table is read left to right:
* Value pair (A,B) equals value pair (C,R).
* Or for this example, A plus B equal result R, with the Carry C.

Note that this table does not describe the logic operations necessary to implement this operation, rather it simply specifies the function of inputs to output values.

With respect to the result, this example may be arithmetically viewed as modulo 2 binary addition, and as logically equivalent to the exclusive-or (exclusive disjunction) binary logic operation.

In this case it can be used for only very simple inputs and outputs, such as 1s and 0s. However, if the number of types of values one can have on the inputs increases, the size of the truth table will  increase.

For instance, in an addition operation, one needs two operands, A and B. Each can have one of two values, zero or one. The number of combinations of these two values is 2×2, or four. So the result is four possible outputs of C and R.  If one were to use base 3, the size would increase to 3×3, or nine possible outputs.

The first "addition" example above is called a half-adder. A full-adder is when the carry from the previous operation is provided as input to the next adder. Thus, a truth table of eight rows would be needed to describe a [[full adder]]'s logic:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B C* | C R
0 0 0  | 0 0
0 1 0  | 0 1
1 0 0  | 0 1
1 1 0  | 1 0
0 0 1  | 0 1
0 1 1  | 1 0
1 0 1  | 1 0
1 1 1  | 1 1

Same as previous, but..
C* = Carry from previous adder
&lt;/pre&gt;

==History==
Irving Anellis has done the research to show that [[C.S. Peirce]] appears to be the earliest logician (in 1893) to devise a truth table matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anellis|first1=Irving H.|title=Peirce's Truth-functional Analysis and the Origin of the Truth Table|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|date=2012|volume=33|pages=87–97|doi=10.1080/01445340.2011.621702}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the summary of his paper:
&lt;blockquote&gt; In 1997, John Shosky discovered, on the verso of a page of the typed transcript of Bertrand Russell's 1912 lecture on "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" truth table matrices. The matrix for negation is Russell's, alongside of which is the matrix for material implication in the hand of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is shown that an unpublished manuscript identified as composed by Peirce in 1893 includes a truth table matrix that is equivalent to the matrix for material implication discovered by John Shosky. An unpublished manuscript by Peirce identified as having been composed in 1883–84 in connection with the composition of Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation" that appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' in 1885 includes an example of an indirect truth table for the conditional. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''−1''' is the [[additive inverse]] of [[1 (number)|1]], that is, the number that when [[addition|added]] to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the [[negative number|negative]] [[integer]] greater than negative two (−2) and less than&amp;nbsp;[[0 (number)|0]].

Negative one bears relation to [[Euler's identity]] since ''e''{{sup|''i''{{pi}}}} = −1.

In [[software development]], '''−1''' is a common initial value for integers and is also used to show that [[Sentinel value|a variable contains no useful information]].

In [[programming languages]], '''−1''' can be used to [[array slicing|index]] the last (or 2nd last) item of an [[array data structure|array]], depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.

'''Negative one''' has some similar but slightly different properties to positive one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xrh89dLWZqEC Mathematical analysis and applications]
 By Jayant V. Deshpande, {{ISBN|1-84265-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algebraic properties ==
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the [[distributive law]] and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity: for ''x'' [[real number|real]], we have

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=1\cdot x+(-1)\cdot x=(1+(-1))\cdot x=0 \cdot x=0&lt;/math&gt;

where we used the fact that any real ''x'' times 0 equals 0, implied by [[cancellation property|cancellation]] from the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot x=(0+0)\cdot x=0\cdot x+0\cdot x \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ImaginaryUnit5.svg|thumb|right|0, 1, −1, '''''[[imaginary unit|i]]''''', and −'''''i''''' in the [[complex plane|complex]] or [[cartesian plane]]]]

In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;x+(-1)\cdot x=0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

so (−1)&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x'', or&amp;nbsp;−''x'', is the arithmetic inverse of ''x''.

=== Square of −1 ===
The [[square (algebra)|square]] of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative real numbers is positive.

For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot 0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]&lt;/math&gt;

The first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number that when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;0 =-1\cdot [1+(-1)]=-1\cdot1+(-1)\cdot(-1)=-1+(-1)\cdot(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

The second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;(-1) \cdot (-1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The above arguments hold in any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], a concept of [[abstract algebra]] generalizing integers and real numbers.

=== Square roots of −1 ===
Although there are no [[Real number| real]] square roots of -1, the [[complex number]] ''[[Imaginary unit|i]]'' satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1, and as such can be considered as a [[square root]] of −1. The only other complex number who's square is 1 is −''i''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/58251.html |title=Ask Dr. Math |publisher=Math Forum |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the algebra of [[quaternion]]s, which contain the complex plane, [[Quaternion#Square roots of −1|the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1 has infinite solutions]].

== Exponentiation to negative integers ==
[[Exponentiation]] of a non-zero real number can be extended to [[Exponentiation#Negative integer exponents|negative integers]]. We make the definition that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|1|''x''}}, meaning that we define raising a number to the power −1 to have the same effect as taking its [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]. This definition is then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;/sup&gt; for real numbers ''a'' and ''b''.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be extended to invertible elements of a ring, by defining  ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; as the multiplicative inverse of ''x''.

−1 that appears next to functions or matrices does not mean raising them to the power −1 but their [[inverse functions]] or [[inverse matrices]]. For example, ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is the inverse of ''f''(''x''), or sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a notation of [[arcsine]] function.

== Computer representation ==
{{Main|Signed number representations}}
Most computer systems represent negative integers using [[two's complement]]. In such systems, −1 is represented using a bit pattern of all ones. For example, an 8-bit signed integer using two's complement would represent −1 as the bitstring "11111111", or "FF" in [[hexadecimal]] (base 16). If interpreted as an unsigned integer, the same bitstring of ''n'' ones represents 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the largest possible value that ''n'' bits can hold. For example, the 8-bit string "11111111" above represents 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;255.

== Programming languages ==
In some programming languages, when used to [[array slicing|index some data types]] (such as an [[array data structure|array]]), then -1 can be used to identify the very last (or 2nd last) item, depending on whether 0 or 1 represents the first item.
If the first item is indexed by 0, then -1 identifies the last item.
If the first item is indexed by 1, then -1 identifies the second-to-last item.
