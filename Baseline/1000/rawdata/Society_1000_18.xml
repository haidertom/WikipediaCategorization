[[Image:Arecibo message bw.svg|thumb|upright=.6|A representation of the 1679-[[bit]] [[Arecibo message]].]]

'''Active SETI''' ('''Active Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence''') is the attempt to send messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life. Active SETI messages are usually sent in the form of radio signals. Physical messages like that of the [[Pioneer plaque]] may also be considered an active SETI message. Active SETI is also known as '''METI''' ('''Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence'''). The term METI was coined by Russian scientist [[Alexander Zaitsev (scientist)|Alexander Zaitsev]], who denoted the clear-cut distinction between Active SETI and METI:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The science known as [[SETI]] deals with searching for messages from aliens. METI deals with the creation and transmission of messages to aliens. Thus, SETI and METI proponents have quite different perspectives. SETI scientists are in a position to address only the local question “does Active SETI make sense?” In other words, would it be reasonable, for SETI success, to transmit with the object of attracting ETI’s attention? In contrast to Active SETI, METI pursues not a local and lucrative impulse, but a more global and unselfish one – to overcome the Great Silence in the Universe, bringing to our extraterrestrial neighbors the long-expected annunciation '''“You are not alone!”'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, [[Douglas Vakoch|Douglas A. Vakoch]] of the [[SETI Institute]] addressed concerns about the validity of Active SETI alone as an experimental science by proposing the integration of Active SETI and Passive SETI programs to engage in a clearly articulated, ongoing, and evolving set of experiments to test various versions of the [[Zoo Hypothesis]], including specific dates at which a first response to messages sent to particular stars could be expected.&lt;ref&gt;

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including [[Douglas Vakoch]], [[David Grinspoon]], [[Seth Shostak]], and [[David Brin]]) at an annual meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the [[Cosmos]] was a good idea;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150213"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-cosmos-risky.html |title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

==Rationale for METI==
In the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0910 Rationale for METI], transmission of the information into the Cosmos is treated as one of the pressing needs of an advanced civilization. This view is not universally accepted, and it does not agree to those who are against the transmission of interstellar radio messages, but at the same time are not against SETI searching. Such duality are called [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0611283 The SETI Paradox].

==Radio message construction==
The lack of an established [[communications protocol]] is a challenge for METI.

First of all, while trying to synthesize an Interstellar Radio Message (IRM), we should bear in mind that Extraterrestrials will first deal with a physical phenomenon and, only after that, perceive the information. At first, ET's receiving system will detect the radio signal; then, the issue of extraction of the received information and comprehension of the obtained message will arise. Therefore, above all, the Constructor of an IRM should be concerned about the ease of signal determination. In other words,
the signal should have maximum openness, which is understood here as an antonym of the term security. This branch of signal synthesis can be named '''anticryptography'''.

To this end, in 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general-purpose binary language,&lt;ref name="Testing SETI Messages Design"&gt;

and provided Rachel M. Reddick with a test message, in a blind test of decryption.&lt;ref name="Testing SETI Messages Design"/&gt; Reddick decoded the entire message after approximately twelve hours of work.&lt;ref name="Testing SETI Messages Design"/&gt; This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the [[Lone Signal]] hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor  strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message.&lt;ref name="Extending the syntax used by the Lone Signal Active SETI project"&gt;

Also characteristics of the radio signal such as wavelength, type of polarization, and modulation have to be considered.

Over galactic distances, the interstellar medium induces some scintillation effects and artificial modulation of electromagnetic signals. This modulation is higher at lower frequencies and is a function of the sky direction. Over large distances, the depth of the modulation can exceed 100%, making any METI signal very difficult to decode.

===Error correction===
In METI research, it is implied that any message must have some redundancy, although the exact amount of redundancy and message formats are still in great dispute.

Using ideograms, instead of binary sequence, already offers some improvement against noise resistance. In faxlike transmissions, ideograms will be spread on many lines. This increases its resistance against short bursts of noise like radio frequency interference or
interstellar scintillation.

One format approach proposed for interstellar messages was to use the product of two prime numbers to construct an image. Unfortunately, this method works only if all the bits are present. As an example, the message sent by [[Frank Drake]] from the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in 1974 did not have any feature to support mechanisms to cope with the inevitable noise degradation of the interstellar medium.

Error correction tolerance rates for previous METI messages
* Arecibo Message (1974) : 8.9% (one page)
* Evpatoria message (1999) : 44% (23 separate pages)
* Evpatoria message (2003) : 46% (one page, estimated)

====Examples====
The 1999 [[Cosmic Call]] transmission was far from being optimal (from our terrestrial point of view) as it was essentially a monochromatic signal spiced with a supplementary information. Additionally, the message had a very small modulation index overall, a condition not viewed as being optimal for interstellar communication.
* Over the 370,967 bits (46,371 bytes) sent, some 314,239 were “1” and 56,768 were “0”—5.54 times as many 1's as 0's.
* Since [[frequency shift keying]] modulation scheme was used, most of the time the signal was on the “0” frequency.
* In addition, “0” tended to be sent in long stretches (white lines in the message).

==Realized projects==
These projects have targeted stars between 17 and 69 light-years from the Earth. The exception is the [[Arecibo message]], which targeted [[globular cluster M13]], approximately 24,000 light-years away.

The first message to reach its destination will be [[RuBisCo Stars]], which should reach [[Teegarden's star]], a [[brown dwarf]] in 2021.

==Potential risk==
{{see also |Search for extraterrestrial intelligence#Debate}}
Active SETI has been heavily criticized due to the perceived risk of revealing the location of the Earth to alien civilizations, without some process of prior international consultation. Notable among its critics is scientist and science fiction author [[David Brin]], particularly in his article "expose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifeboat.com/ex/shouting.at.the.cosmos |title=Shouting at the Cosmos |author=David Brin |date=September 2006 |orig-year=last updated July 2008 |website=Lifeboat Foundation |accessdate=9 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307223116/http://lifeboat.com/ex/shouting.at.the.cosmos|archivedate=7 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Russian and Soviet radio engineer and astronomer [[Alexander L. Zaitsev]] has argued against these fears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sending and searching for interstellar messages |first=Alexander L. |last=Zaitsev |date=September 2008 |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=63 |issue=5–6 |pages=614–617 |via=ScienceDirect |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2008.05.014 |arxiv = 0711.2368 |bibcode = 2008AcAau..63..614Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jre.cplire.ru/jre/may08/2/text_e.html |title=Detection Probability of Terrestrial Radio Signals by a Hostile Super-civilization |author=Alexander L.

Chafer |author3=Richard Braastad |website=SETI League |accessdate=9 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221134306/http://www.setileague.org/editor/meti.htm|archivedate=21 February 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To lend a quantitative basis to discussions of the risks of transmitting deliberate messages from Earth, the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaaseti.org |title=Overview |website=International Academy of Astronautics – SETI Permanent Committee |accessdate=9 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510081227/http://iaaseti.org/|archivedate=10 May 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted in 2007 a new analytical tool, the [[San Marino Scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iaaseti.org/smiscale.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208183315/http://iaaseti.org/smiscale.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 December 2007|title=The San Marino Scale |website=International Academy of Astronautics – SETI Permanent Committee |accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by Prof. [[Ivan Almar]] and Prof. [[H. Paul Shuch]], the San Marino Scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth as a function of signal intensity and information content.  Its adoption suggests that not all such transmissions are created equal, thus each must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis before establishing blanket international policy regarding Active SETI.

In 2012, Jacob Haqq-Misra, Michael Busch, Sanjoy Som, and Seth Baum argued that while the benefits of radio communication on Earth likely outweigh the potential harms of detection by extraterrestrial watchers, the uncertainty regarding the outcome of contact with extraterrestrial beings creates difficulty in assessing whether or not to engage in long-term and large-scale METI.&lt;ref name="haqq-misra-2013"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[João Pedro de Magalhães]] proposed transmitting an invitation message to any extraterrestrial intelligences watching us already in the context of the [[Zoo Hypothesis]] and inviting them to respond. By using existing television and radio channels, de Magalhães argued this would not put us in any danger, "at least not in any more danger than we are already if much more advanced extraterrestrial civilizations are aware of us and can reach the solar system."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=de Magalhaes |first=J. P. |arxiv=1509.03652 |title=A direct communication proposal to test the Zoo Hypothesis |date=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2016.06.001 |volume=38 |journal=Space Policy |pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Vakoch]], president of METI, argues that passive SETI itself is already an endorsement of active SETI, since "If we detect a signal from aliens through a SETI program, there’s no way to prevent a cacophony of responses from Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Hannah Osborne |url=http://www.newsweek.com/advanced-alien-civilization-send-messages-meti-713186 |title=Scientists Have Sent Messages to Advanced Alien Civilizations—And Are Hoping for a Reply in 25 Years |date=2017-11-16 |work=Newsweek |access-date=2017-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117024323/http://www.newsweek.com/advanced-alien-civilization-send-messages-meti-713186 |archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beacon proposals==
One proposal for a 10 billion watt interstellar SETI beacon was dismissed by [[Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] to be infeasible for a pre-Type I civilization on the [[Kardashev scale]].&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this 1980s technical argument assumes omni-directional beacons which may not be the best way to proceed on many technical grounds. Advances in consumer electronics have made possible transmitters that simultaneously transmit many narrow beams, covering the million or so nearest stars but not the spaces between.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This multibeam approach can reduce the power and cost to levels that are reasonable with current mid-2000s Earth technology.

Once civilizations have discovered each other's locations, the energy requirements for maintaining contact and exchanging information can be significantly reduced through the use of highly directional transmission technologies.

A 2018 study estimated an 1 to 2 megawatt infrared laser focused through a 30 to 45 meter telescope could be seen from about 20,000 light years away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/11/08/magnified-laser-from-earth-could-attract-alien-attention-mit-researcher-says/HrbyazamrVaQ1NaBJhdllJ/story.html Magnified laser from Earth could attract alien attention, MIT researcher says]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''African Writers' Evening''' is the first regular evening held for African writers at the UK's Poetry Café. It was started in 2003 by [[Nii Ayikwei Parkes]] in consultation with the directors of the [[Poetry Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x-bout.com/awe/?page_id=2|title=African Writers Evening &amp;raquo; About|accessdate=28 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926110840/http://www.x-bout.com/awe/?page_id=2| archivedate= 26 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he completed a residency there. The solid reputation of African Writers' Evening is based on its ability to consistently identify and feature talented emerging writers.

Diana Evans and [[Hisham Matar]], for example, were both featured prior to the official releases of their début publications, two of 2007′s features Ken Kamoche and [[Sade Adeniran]] were shortlisted for the 2008 [[Commonwealth Prize]] for their first books, and [[Inua Ellams]] won an [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] First Award three years after his first featured appearance at African Writers' Evening in 2006. Recently, the event's founder Nii Ayikwei Parkes was himself shortlisted for the Commonwealth Prize and the November 2009 featured reader, [[Nadifa Mohamed]] won the 2010 [[Betty Trask Award]].

African Writers' Evening is held bi-monthly from March to November with occasional special events, such as the AWE Heritage Series launched at the [[Southbank Centre]] on 6 July 2009 and AWE/NYC, which was held at the Bowery Club in September 2009. While the event is still held mainly at the Poetry Café in [[Covent Garden]], a recent partnership with the [[Southbank Centre]] has seen the end-of-year reading in November held at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] since 2008.

==Policy==
African Writers' Evening features writers of all genres and defines "African" based on lived experience rather than simplistic notions of heritage. Featured writers have included white writers like [[Robyn Scott]], [[Isobel Dixon]] and [[Gillian Slovo]], as well as Africans of Indian origin such as Sharmila Chauhan.

==First event==
The first African Writers' Evening was held in July 2003 at the Poetry Café and featured Nii Ayikwei Parkes (who was writer-in-residence at the venue), [[Jessica Horn]], a Ugandan poet, and Abby Ajayi, a Nigerian-British short story and script writer. The event in its current format started in July 2004. Its tagline is: ''Where Africa speaks and the world listens''.

==History and expansion==
African Writers' Evening initially paid writers travel expenses and they read for free as a way of supporting the reading series. However, in September 2005, the series received funding from the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]] and began to pay the featured writers an appearance fee. This development allowed the series to begin flying writers in from abroad to share their work: [[Helon Habila]]'s appearance at the Royal Festival Hall in 2009 was part of this trend.

Since the New York event held in September 2009, African Writers' Evening appears to be on a path of expansion and collaboration. In April 2010, they held an event in Birmingham in collaboration with The Drum Theatre, the [[British Council]] and London Book Festival and in July 2010 a book sale event, named the African Book Market was held at the Poetry Café in partnership with major publishers, such as [[Random House]], as well as smaller outfits like [[Serpent's Tail]]. They also announced a book discussion initiative starting in September 2010.

==Organisation==
The event is run by a London-based collective called London Society, Literature, Arts and Music Central, abbreviated as London SLAM Central.

'''Allofeeding''' is a type of [[Evolutionary models of food sharing|food sharing]] [[Behavior|behaviour]] observed in [[Cooperative breeding|cooperatively breed]]ing species of [[bird]]s. Allofeeding refers to a parent, sibling or unrelated adult bird feeding [[altricial]] [[hatchling]]s, which are dependent on [[parental care]] for their survival.&lt;ref name="barrows"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yaXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE9ePx_sHRAhWLq1QKHUJ1CC8Q6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference|last=Barrows|first=Edward M.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-3652-1|edition=3rd|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding also refers to food sharing between adults of the same species.&lt;ref name="handicap"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ImjqhNqjiqsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-jfi2gMLRAhVIhlQKHVOQAHE4ChDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|last2=Zahavi|first2=Avishag|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-19-510035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, [[Courtship display|courtship]], egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan M.|date=1980|title=Demand Behavior: A New Interpretation of Courtship Feeding|jstor=1367395|journal=The Condor|volume=82|issue=3|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/1367395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=Matthew R.|last2=Holmes|first2=Aaron L.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

Allofeeding evolved for different reasons in different species of birds. While Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows allofeed to reduce [[predation]] during incubation, Sichuan Jays allofeed to increase a female’s nutritional level prior to egg laying, and Chinstrap Penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jing|first=Yu|last2=Fang|first2=Yun|last3=Strickland|first3=Dan|last4=Lu|first4=Nan|last5=Sun|first5=Yue-Hua|date=2009|title=Alloparenting in the Rare Sichuan Jay (Perisoreus Internigrans) - Cuidado Aloparental en la Especie Rara Perisoreus internigrans|journal=The Condor|volume=111|issue=4|pages=662–667|doi=10.1525/cond.2009.080114|jstor=10.1525/cond.2009.080114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mori|first=Yoshihisa|last2=Kokubun|first2=Nobuo|last3=Shin|first3=Hyoung-Chul|last4=Takahashi|first4=Akinori|date=2010-10-01|title=An observation of between-mates feeding behaviour in chick-guarding chinstrap penguins|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|journal=Polar Biology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1437–1438|doi=10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well-being of the chicks. Arabian Bablers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the King Penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be  altruistic and highly revered. And the far more practical Barn Owl, of course, peer allofeeds merely to reduce sibling rivalry/competition during meal times.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlisle|first=Tamsie R.|last2=Zahavi|first2=Amotz|date=1986-04-01|title=Helping at the nest, allofeeding and social status in immature arabian babblers|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299665|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=339–351|doi=10.1007/BF00299665|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roulin|first=A.|last2=Monstiers|first2=B.

Although many species of birds exhibit allofeeding, there are some species that do not perform allofeeding, such as Siberian Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

== Allofeeding between mates ==
Many species of migratory [[songbird]]s display allofeeding during the [[incubation period]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; During the incubation period, a male songbird will feed its mate, while she sits on the eggs through beak-to-beak interaction.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is suggested to be adaptive because the male is indirectly investing in its offspring.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The male uses its energy to forage and retrieve food, and to feed the female.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This behaviour of the male reduces nutritional stress of the female because it reduces the amount of time the female spends foraging.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In addition, the allofeeding behaviour decreases the number of times a female has to leave the nest, which in turn extends the incubation period and reduces the risk of nest being detected by a predator.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Overall, allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased fitness and is therefore considered advantageous.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; However, Nolan (1958) theorizes that allofeeding is a non-adaptive and is derived from anticipatory parental care.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Allofeeding during the incubation period can also transpire through both the male and the female interchangeably feeding each other via beak-to-beak interactions, while a mate receiving the food incubates the eggs.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Once feeding is completed, the recipient now becomes the feeder and the mate that was just foraging incubates the eggs. For example, Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows (''Spizella breweri breweri'') allofeed in this manner.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; A recent study by Halley et al., 2015, examined allofeeding in twenty-four nests of Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study revealed that allofeeding occurred at low frequencies (55%) in nests with biparental incubation and no allofeeding occurred in uniparental nests.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study suggests that allofeeding is an intraspecific signal required to maintain social bonds between mates, in addition to increasing the nutrition levels of females and concealment of the nest.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Furthermore, the study found that incubation sessions per hour were higher in biparental nests with allofeeding than in biparental nests without allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; These findings indicate that allofeeding is beneficial because it reduces the risk of predation from visually oriented predators through increased nest concealment,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; which can maximize the fitness of males while increasing the fitness of females.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

There have been many documented observations of allofeeding between mates (mate allofeeding).&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; However, in penguins allofeeding between mates is rare.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; In 2010, [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguins]] (''P. antarctica'') allofeeding was reported during the period of chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The researchers witnessed a male feeding a female, which had a large chick in its nest.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The behaviour was engaged by the female frequently pecking the side of the male’s bill to stimulate the male to regurgitate its food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; This resulted in the male regurgitating its food into the female’s open mouth. This allofeeding behaviour was identical to the manner in which a chick begs its parent for food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Notably, during this behaviour the female kept the attention of male when the chick tried to gain the male’s attention.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; It is proposed that mate allofeeding in Chinstrap Penguins was performed to strengthen the bond between the pair.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

Allofeeding between mates can also occur during courtship.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding occurs in half of bird subfamilies and mainly appears in monogamous bird species.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs or increase a female’s nutritional level before laying eggs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; For example, in the Sichuan Jay ([[Sichuan jay|''P. internigrans'']]), females are fed by only one male during courtship.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is suggested that allofeeding the female during courtship, increases a female’s nutritional level before egg laying.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This behaviour was also recorded in the Grey Jays (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Other species of birds display allofeeding during courtship. Additionally, courtship allofeeding in some birds species is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

== Allofeeding and parental care ==

=== ''Aptenodytes patagonicus'' ===
[[File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|thumb|Emperor Penguin (''Aptenodytes patagonicus)'' feeding its offspring]]
A parent feeding a non-biological chick via bill-to-bill interactions is a form of allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lecomte|first=Nicolas|last2=Kuntz|first2=Gregoire|last3=Lambert|first3=Nicolas|last4=Gendner|first4=Jean-Paul|last5=Handrich|first5=Yves|last6=Maho|first6=Yvon Le|last7=Bost|first7=Charles-André|title=Alloparental feeding in the king penguin|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347205004173|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=71|issue=2|pages=457–462|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouventin|first=Pierre|last2=Barbraud|first2=Christophe|last3=Rubin|first3=Michel|title=Adoption in the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1023–1029|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental allofeeding occurs in all altricial species of birds to ensure proper growth, development, and to prevent starvation of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Sönke|last2=Griesser|first2=Michael|last3=Ekman|first3=Jan|date=2005-01-01|title=Predator-induced plasticity in nest visitation rates in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus)|url=http://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/16/1/309/206728/Predatorinduced-plasticity-in-nest-visitation|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=309–315|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh163|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of allofeeding has been shown to be a form of parental care in some species, such as in King Penguins ([[King penguin|''A. patagonicus'']]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguins are pelagic seabirds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguin chicks form dense groups called crèches during winter for social thermoregulation when food availability is low.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The formation of crèches results from the parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks to gather food from the sea.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A study by Lecomte et al., 2015 examined the allofeeding behaviour in King Penguins, in which they marked the white underbellies of 74 non-breeding adults and 103 breeding pairs with a unique dark colouring called dye-mark code of Nyanzol-D.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) found 22% of the marked adults feed 65% of the chicks in crèches, revealing that allofeeding behaviour was most common during the breeding season.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) also identified that most of the 22% of adult King Penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour were unable to successfully breed along with few breeders performing the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The allofeeding behaviour resulted in more feedings for chicks,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which is consistent with study by Pierre et al. (1994) that showed that allofeeding in penguins increases the chick growth rate from 35g/day to 190g/day.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; From these results, Lecomte et al., (2015) concluded that allofeeding increased the survival rate of chicks in crèches.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The results imply that parental allofeeding in King Penguins is an altruistic behaviour, where allofeeding benefits the young at a cost to the non-biological parent.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Notably, no direct benefits to the non-biological parents have been described.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The cost of allofeeding non-biological chicks resulted in no detrimental effects to the fitness of the [[Alloparenting|alloparent]], because the cost of allofeeding is low (several grams) when compared to the nutritional costs of an adult king penguin, which is several kilograms.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, it is suggested that allofeeding many chicks may cost each chick lost meals that can cause negative effects on the fitness of allofed chicks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, allofeeding decreases when non-biological parents had offspring.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas antarctica'' ===
The [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguin]] (''P. antarctica'') is another species of penguin that displays allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Allofeeding in the Chinstrap Penguin has been observed between the female and its offspring.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Similar to mate allofeeding in this species, the offspring of a female will peck the side of the female’s bill to signal the female to regurgitate its food into the chick's open mouth.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

=== ''Perisoreus internigrans'' ===
In Sichuan Jays ([[Sichuan jay|''P. Internigrans'']]), females are not the only sex that participates in the allofeeding of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; During their first week of life, the chicks are only fed by the male.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/studies-of-less-familiar-birds-162-siberian-jay/|title=Studies of less Familiar birds 162 Siberian Jay - British Birds|last=Blomgren|first=Arne Blomgren|date=|work=British Birds|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male forages and stores food in a pouch within its throat. At the nest, the male regurgitates the semi-digested food from its pouch into the mouths of its chicks.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; After the first week, the male continues to feed the chicks while the female begins feeding the chicks.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The female uses the same method as the male.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

== Peer allofeeding ==

=== ''Turdoides sqamiceps'' ===
There have been many reported cases of allofeeding between siblings in several species of birds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; For example, the Arabian Babblers ([[Arabian babbler|''T. sqamiceps'']]) are a territorial, desert inhibiting species of bird that participate in cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In this species, non-breeders show numerous types of cooperative behaviour, including allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Adult and immature Babblers, as well as previous and newly fledged Babblers, will frequently engage in allofeeding behaviour.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Carlisle et al. (1986) revealed that Arabian Babblers participate in peer allofeeding in order to increase social rank, which increases fitness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is supported by the Zahavi's hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; An individual (a dominate Babbler) can increase in social rank by allofed a subordinate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the contrary, an individual (a subordinate Babbler) can decrease in social rank when they are allofed by a dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Subordinate Babblers have been observed refusing to be allofeed by dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The refusal resulted in the dominate Babbler becoming aggressive with the subordinate - hitting or chasing the subordinate.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Dominate Babblers also showed the same aggressive behaviours when a subordinate tried to allofeed it.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== ''Tyto alba'' ===
Another species that exhibits peer allofeeding is the [[Barn owl|Barn Owl]] (''T. alba'').&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Barn Owl nest siblings establish a hierarchy for the sharing of food resources via vocal negotiations.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; It is suggested that Barn Owl nest siblings show peer allofeeding to reduce sibling competition in the food sharing hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Peer allofeeding observed in 60 nestling pairs revealed that the behaviour occurs by a donor sibling placing the food item on the ground in front of the receiver sibling, which transfers the food item to its bill using its talons.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Alternatively, the donor sibling uses its bill to place the food item in the bill of the receiver sibling.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; As well, peer allofeeding behaviour in Barn Owl siblings is proposed to increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of the peer performing the allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

== Intraspecific allofeeding ==

=== ''Perisoreus Internigrans'' ===
[[File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|thumb|Gray Jays (''Perisoreus canadensis)'' feeding offspring at the nest]]
Intraspecific allofeeding in Sichuan Jays (''[[Sichuan jay|P. internigrans]]'') is performed during the nestling and fledging period by non-breeders.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; One to three non-breeders support a nesting breeding pair by feeding the chicks, regurgitating the food from their throat pouches.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; In 2009, Jing et al. determined that two non-breeders contributed to 44% of feedings in the nest of two Sichuan Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Jing et al. (2009) suggest that allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased nest survival.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

In Sichuan Jays, allofeeding is hypothesized to be evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In this species, two to three non-breeders will allofeed the young of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The large body mass (21% heavier than Siberian Jays) of the Sichuan Jays, and the presence of more than one non-breeder, allows one non-breeder to ward off a predator while another non-breeder protects the young from additional predators.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Both the large body mass of the non-breeders and the presence of multiple non-breeders reduces the risk of injury or death when predators are encountered.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefits of allofeeding the young outweighs the cost of injury or death of the non-breeder and/or chick when more than one non-breeder is present.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Peer allofeeding has also been observed in the Gray Jay (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Gray Jay, non-breeders allofeed the young after fledging.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

Not all species of jays allofeed their young, such as the Siberian Jay (''[[Siberian jay|P. infaustus]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Siberian Jays, non-breeders do not allofeed the chicks of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is predicted that Siberian Jays do not display allofeeding because the cost of predation is too high.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Siberian Jays are continuously threatened by a more dangerous predators, the Eurasian Sparrowhawk and Northern Goshawk, then Gray Jays, which are threatened by Eurasian red squirrel.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  One non-breeder per breeding pair and the small size (21% less body mass than the Sichuan Jays) of the Siberian Jays, in combination with continuous risk of predation, reveals that the non-breeding Siberian Jays are unable to confront predators and protect the nest simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This indicates that the cost of allofeeding the young is more costly to the non-breeder when one non-breeder is present because an encounter with a predator increases the risk of injury and death of both the young and the non-breeder.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefit of allofeeding the young does not exceed the cost of injury or death of non-breeder and/or young.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This is consistent with the predator-avoidance hypothesis, suggesting that the cost of allofeeding in the Siberian Jays prevents allofeeding from being evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

The '''anti-nuclear movement''' is a [[new social movements|social movement]] that opposes various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]]. Some [[direct action]] groups, [[environmental movement]]s, and [[professional]] organisations have identified themselves with the movement at the local, national, or international level.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Fox Butterfield.

The initial objective of the movement was [[nuclear disarmament]], though since the late 1960s opposition has included the use of [[nuclear power]]. Many anti-nuclear groups oppose both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The formation of [[green party|green parties]] in the 1970s and 1980s was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics.&lt;ref name="E. Gene Frankland 2001, p. 24"&gt;John Barry and E. Gene Frankland, ''International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics'', 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and diplomats have debated [[nuclear weapon]]s policy since before the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="brow"/&gt; The public became concerned about [[nuclear weapons testing]] from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. In 1963, many countries ratified the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.&lt;ref name="rudig2"/&gt;

Some local opposition to [[nuclear power]] emerged in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name=well&gt;Paula Garb. [http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm  Review of Critical Masses], ''Journal of Political Ecology'', Vol 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.&lt;ref name="rudig"/&gt; In the early 1970s, there were large [[protests]] about a proposed nuclear power plant in [[Wyhl]], West Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of [[Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref name="pub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="got"/&gt; Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s&lt;ref name=jimfalk&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and while opposition to nuclear power continues, increasing public support for nuclear power has re-emerged over the last decade in light of growing awareness of global warming and renewed interest in all types of clean energy (see the [[Pro-nuclear movement]]).

A protest against nuclear power occurred in July 1977 in [[Bilbao]], Spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. Following the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest was held in New York City, involving 200,000 people. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] west of Hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. The largest protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in [[New York City]] against nuclear weapons.  A 1983 nuclear weapons protest in [[West Berlin]] had about 600,000 participants. In May 1986, following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program. In the US, public opposition preceded the shutdown of the [[Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant|Shoreham]], [[Yankee Rowe]], [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant|Millstone 1]], [[Rancho Seco]], [[Maine Yankee]], and many other nuclear power plants.

For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following [[public relations]] activities by the nuclear industry,&lt;ref name=leoh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants |title=Nuclear lobbyists wined and dined senior civil servants, documents show |author=Leo Hickman  |date=28 November 2012  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diane Farseta 38-56" &gt;{{cite web |title=The Campaign to Sell Nuclear |author=Diane Farseta  |date=September 1, 2008 |volume=64 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=38–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nuclear Charm Offensive"&gt;Jonathan Leake.

From an anti-nuclear point of view, there is a threat to modern civilization from global [[nuclear war]] by accidental or deliberate nuclear strike.&lt;ref name=Fridab/&gt; Some climate scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions from climatic effects alone and disabled future generation

Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 74-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anti-nuclear weapons groups cite the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the [[International Court of Justice]], ''[[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons]]'', in which it found that 'the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;k=e1&amp;case=95&amp;code=unan&amp;p3=4|title=Cour internationale de Justice - International Court|website=www.icj-cij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause for pacifists for decades. But more recently mainstream politicians and retired military leaders have advocated [[nuclear disarmament]]. In January 2007 an article in ''The Wall Street Journal'', authored by [[Henry Kissinger]], [[William Perry|Bill Perry]], [[George Shultz]] and [[Sam Nunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-new-abolitionists |title=The new abolitionists |author=Hugh Gusterson |date=30 March 2012 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606022845/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-new-abolitionists |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were veterans of the [[cold-war]] who believed in using nuclear weapons for [[nuclear deterrence|deterrence]]. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme concern.&lt;ref name=globalzero&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18836134 |title=Nuclear endgame: The growing appeal of zero |author= |date=June 16, 2011 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, some countries have built their own [[Second strike|second-strike capability]] of [[massive retaliation|massive deterrence]] in the event of a military attack with [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. 
Two examples of this second-strike capability are the [[Samson Option]] strategy of [[Israel]], and the [[Dead Hand]] system of [[Russia]].

There are large variations in peoples’ understanding of the issues surrounding nuclear power, including the technology itself, its deployment, [[climate change]], and [[energy security]]. There is a wide spectrum of views and concerns over [[nuclear power]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sustainable Development Commission]].

[http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/publications/downloads/IsNuclearTheAnswer.pdf Is Nuclear the Answer?] p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have shown that the public "perceives nuclear power as a very risky technology" and, around the world, nuclear energy has declined in popularity since the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V.

''Nuclear Power is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else'', Melbourne University Press, {{ISBN|0-522-85251-3}}, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of nuclear power have raised a number of related concerns:&lt;ref name = bm&gt;[[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]]. [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/07sa.html Opposing nuclear power: past and present], ''Social Alternatives'', Vol. 26, No. 2, Second Quarter 2007, pp. 43–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nuclear accident]]s: a concern that the core of a nuclear power plant could overheat and melt down, releasing radioactivity.
*[[High-level radioactive waste management|Radioactive waste disposal]]: a concern that nuclear power results in large amounts of radioactive waste, some of which remains dangerous for very long periods.
*[[Nuclear proliferation]]: a concern that [[Heavy water reactor#Nuclear proliferation|some types]] of nuclear reactor designs use and/or produce  [[fissile material]] which could be used in [[nuclear weapons]].
*[[Economics of new nuclear power plants|High cost]]: a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive.
*[[Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack|Attacks on nuclear plants]]: a concern that nuclear facilities could be targeted by terrorists or criminals.
*Curtailed [[civil liberties]]: a concern that the risk of nuclear accidents, proliferation and terrorism may be used to justify restraints on citizen rights.

Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide.&lt;ref name = bm/&gt; Anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima nuclear emergency]] as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/22/japan-nuclear-crisis-uk-power-stations |title=Japan nuclear crisis puts UK public off new power stations |author=Bibi van der Zee |date=22 March 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', [[Jim Falk]]  explores connections between technological concerns and political concerns. Falk suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear power have often focused initially on the "range of physical hazards which accompany the technology" and leads to a "concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry" A more neutral observer might observe that this is nothing more than a [[conspiracy theory]]. [[Baruch Fischhoff]], a social science professor said that many people really do not trust the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22NUKE.html?pagewanted=all  Edging Back to Nuclear Power] ''The New York Times'', April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wade Allison]], a physics professor actually says "radiation is safe &amp; all nations should embrace nuclear technology"&lt;ref name= "Why &amp; technology"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ6aL3wv4v0&amp;feature=youtu.be|title= Why radiation is safe &amp; all nations should embrace nuclear technology|authors= Prof. Wade Allison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M.V. Ramana]] says that "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by nuclear safety violations, or through ineffectiveness or corruption of the nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M. V. Ramana |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |pages=47–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of  numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern. M.V. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]] |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear proponents have tried to regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs include those that  incorporate passive safety and Small Modular Reactors. While these reactor designs "are intended to inspire trust, they may have an unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted safety features".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M.

Since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power as a solution to the [[greenhouse effect]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name = markd/&gt; Nuclear power, the industry says, emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide. Anti-nuclear groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions.

There is a wide range of published energy-related studies which conclude that [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency programs]] and [[renewable energy|renewable power technologies]] are a better energy option than nuclear power plants. This diverse range of studies come from many different sources, across the political spectrum, and from various academic disciplines, which suggests that there is a consensus among many independent, non-partisan energy experts that nuclear power plants are a poor way to produce electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]'', ''[[Non-Nuclear Futures]]'', ''[[Reaction Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The international nuclear fusion project [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) is constructing the world's largest and most advanced experimental [[tokamak]] [[fusion reactor|nuclear fusion reactor]] in the south of [[France]]. A collaboration between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]], the project aims to make a transition from experimental studies of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics to electricity-producing [[fusion power]] plants. In 2005, [[Greenpeace International]] issued a press statement criticizing government funding of the ITER, believing the money should have been diverted to renewable energy sources and claiming that fusion energy would result in nuclear waste and nuclear weapons proliferation issues. A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]] (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium [[hydrogen]] isotopes used in the fusion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1631650,00.html |title=France Wins Nuclear Fusion Plant|author=Deutsche Welle|date=28 June 2005|website=dw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power “remains a distant dream”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/anti-nuclear/issues/nfc/power/new-reactor-types/ |title=New Reactor Types – pebble bed, thorium, plutonium, fusion |author=Jim Green |year=2012 |work=Friends of the Earth }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Nuclear Association]] have said that fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author= World Nuclear Association |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and [[cost overrun|budget overruns]].

Anti-nuclear groups say that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting [[energy conservation]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures. Energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption while providing the same level of energy "services".&lt;ref name=gierec&gt;Greenpeace International and European Renewable Energy Council (January 2007).

According to [[Lester R. Brown]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

In the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy.

[[File:Anti-nuclear protest at the NTS 3.jpg|thumb|Members of [[Nevada Desert Experience]] hold a prayer vigil during the Easter period of 1982 at the entrance to the [[Nevada Test Site]].]]

The anti-nuclear movement is a [[new social movements|social movement]] which operates at the local, national, and international level. Various types of groups have identified themselves with the movement:&lt;ref name="faculty.virginia.edu"/&gt;
* [[direct action]] groups, such as the [[Clamshell Alliance]] and [[Shad Alliance]]
* [[Environmentalism|environmental]] groups, such as [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Greenpeace]]
* [[consumer protection]] groups, such as [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Critical Mass|Critical Mass]]
* [[professional]] organisations,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; such as [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]
* [[political party|political parties]] such as [[European Free Alliance]]

Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public [[protest]]s and acts of [[civil disobedience]] which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing [[public policy]] through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licensing proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt. [http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies] ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the United States, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years "made nuclear energy untenable in many countries".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, the formation of [[green parties]] was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics (e.g., in Germany and Sweden).&lt;ref name="E. Gene Frankland 2001, p. 24"/&gt;

Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on [[nuclear power]] and energy issues.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that "his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. Following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name=kits/&gt;

They "want the government to scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant – the fourth in densely populated Taiwan". Scores of aboriginal protesters "demanded the removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their [[Orchid Island]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_776471.html |title=About 2,000 Taiwanese stage anti-nuclear protest |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Straits Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |title=Australian Rallies Remember Fukushima Disaster |author=Phil Mercer |date=March 11, 2012 |work=VOA News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312194611/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |archivedate=12 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, South Korean environmental groups held a rally in Seoul to oppose nuclear power.

===Casualties===
[[File:Gorleben0001.JPG|thumb|Anti-nuclear demonstrations near [[Gorleben]], Lower Saxony, Germany, 8 May 1996]]
Casualties during anti-nuclear protests include:

*On 9 December 1982, [[Norman Mayer]], an American anti–nuclear weapons activist, was shot and killed by the [[United States Park Police]] after threatening to blow up the [[Washington Monument]], [[Washington, D.C.]], unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken.
*On 10 July 1985, the flagship of [[Greenpeace]], [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|''Rainbow Warrior'']], was sunk by French agents in New Zealand waters, and a Greenpeace photographer was killed. The ship was involved in protests against [[nuclear weapons testing]] at [[Mururoa Atoll]]. The French Government initially denied any involvement with the sinking but eventually admitted its guilt in October 1985. Two French agents pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter, and the French Government paid $7 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Newtan, Samuel Upton (2007).

==Impact==

===Impact on popular culture===
{{See also|List of films about nuclear issues}}
[[File:International Uranium Film Festival.jpg|thumbnail|Montage of film stills from the [[International Uranium Film Festival]]]]

Beginning in the 1950s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' and [[List of films about nuclear issues|feature films]] such as ''[[Godzilla (1954)]]'',''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Rainbow Warrior (film)|The Rainbow Warrior]]'' (1992).

''Dr. Strangelove'' explored "what might happen within the Pentagon ... if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union". One reviewer called the movie "one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been on the screen".&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Crowther. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE367BC4950DFB766838F679EDE Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove (1964)] ''The New York Times'', January 31, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The China Syndrome'' has been described as a "gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power" which had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear plant]] occurred several weeks after the film opened. [[Jane Fonda]] plays a TV reporter who witnesses a near-[[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] (the "[[China Syndrome (nuclear meltdown)|China syndrome]]" of the title) at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer, played by [[Jack Lemmon]]. The plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting "have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9338/The-China-Syndrome/overview The China Syndrome (1979)] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Silkwood'' was inspired by the true-life story of [[Karen Silkwood]], who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant where she worked.&lt;ref name=contr/&gt;

''[[Dark Circle (film)|Dark Circle]]'' is a 1982 American documentary film that focuses on the connections between the [[nuclear weapons]] and the [[nuclear power]] industries, with a strong emphasis on the individual human and protracted U.S. environmental costs involved.  A clear point made by the film is that while only two bombs were dropped on Japan, [[Nevada National Security Site|many hundreds were exploded in the United States]]. The film won the Grand Prize for documentary at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a national [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding individual achievement in news and documentary."&lt;ref name="Dark Circle"&gt;''[https://www.pbs.org/pov/darkcircle/ Dark Circle]'', DVD release date March 27, 2007, Directors: Judy Irving, Chris Beaver, Ruth Landy. {{ISBN|0-7670-9304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the opening scenes and about half of its length, the film focuses on the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] and [[Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|its plutonium contamination of the area's environment]].

''[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]'' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] produced by the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]. It features interviews with four American government officials who were in office during the [[Cold War]] period, but are now advocating for the elimination of [[nuclear weapon]]s. They are: [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George Shultz]], [[Sam Nunn]], and [[William Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=2010-06-10 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123012569&amp;sc=emaf |title=Documentary Advances Nuclear Free Movement |publisher=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) was a musical group founded in 1979 by [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], following the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]].  The group organized a series of five ''No Nukes'' concerts held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City in September 1979.  On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large anti-nuclear rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the [[Battery Park City]] [[landfill]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Herman B1"/&gt; The album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', and a film, also titled ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'', were both released in 1980 to document the performances.

In 2007, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne, as part of the [[No Nukes group]], recorded a [[music video]] of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song "[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nukefree.org/node/96 |title="For What It’s Worth," No Nukes Reunite After Thirty Years|website=www.nukefree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirs.org/home.htm Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609064533/http://www.nirs.org/home.htm |date=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' is a nontechnical online magazine that has been published continuously since 1945, when it was founded by former [[Manhattan Project]] [[physicist]]s after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. The ''Bulletin''{{'}}s primary aim is to inform the public about nuclear policy debates while advocating for the international control of nuclear weapons. One of the driving forces behind the creation of the ''Bulletin'' was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy at the dawn of the [[atomic age]]. In 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the ''Bulletin'' to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that atomic war could bring about.&lt;ref name="Bombs Early Light" &gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Paul S. |authorlink=Paul Boyer (historian) |title=By the Bomb's Early Light |publisher=Pantheon |year=1985 |isbn=9780394528786 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the ''Bulletin'' was involved in the formation of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], annual conferences of scientists concerned about [[nuclear proliferation]].

Historian [[Lawrence S. Wittner]] has argued that anti-nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about nuclear weapons. Public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others. Wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with "Truman’s decision to explore the [[Baruch Plan]], Eisenhower’s efforts towards a nuclear test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and Kennedy’s signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

In terms of nuclear power, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in the September 1975 issue, reported that "the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power."&lt;ref name=eleven/&gt; California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over [[High level radioactive waste|waste disposal]],&lt;ref&gt;Jim Doyle.

The proliferation of nuclear weapons became a presidential priority issue for the [[Carter Administration]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name = gamson/&gt; To deal with proliferation problems, President Carter promoted stronger international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor technology. Although a strong supporter of nuclear power generally, Carter turned against the breeder reactor because the [[plutonium]] it produced could be diverted into nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=gamson&gt;William A.

For many years after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back to the forefront of policy discussion in the [[nuclear renaissance]] countries.&lt;ref name = markd/&gt;&lt;ref name=res/&gt; But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through [[nuclear power phase-out]] legislation.&lt;ref name=res&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS101123+06-May-2009+BW20090506 Research and Markets: International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power] ''Reuters'', May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a 2007 [[University of Maryland]] survey showed that 73 percent of the public surveyed favours the elimination of all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to 400 weapons each. Given the unpopularity of nuclear weapons, U.S. politicians have been wary of supporting new nuclear programs. Republican-dominated congresses "have defeated the [[Presidency of George W.

Today, some 26,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nine nuclear powers, with thousands on hair-trigger alert. Although U.S., Russian, and British nuclear arsenals are shrinking in size, those in the four Asian nuclear nations—China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea—are growing, in large part because of tensions among them. This Asian arms race also has possibilities of bringing Japan into the nuclear club.&lt;ref name=lsw/&gt;

German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and anti-nuclear protests within Germany. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |author=Annika Breidthardt |date=May 30, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, countries such as [[Anti-nuclear movement in Australia|Australia]], [[Anti-nuclear movement in Austria|Austria]], [[Nuclear energy in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Nuclear energy in Greece|Greece]], [[Nuclear energy in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Nuclear energy in Italy|Italy]], Latvia, Liechtenstein, [[Nuclear energy in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Nuclear energy in Malta|Malta]], [[Nuclear energy in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Nuclear power in Israel|Israel]], [[Nuclear energy in Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|New Zealand]], and [[Nuclear energy in Norway|Norway]] remain opposed to nuclear power.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gl2011"/&gt; [[Anti-nuclear movement in Germany|Germany]] and [[Anti-nuclear movement in Switzerland|Switzerland]] are [[Nuclear power phase-out|phasing-out nuclear power]].&lt;ref name=gl2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="James Kanter"/&gt;

===Public opinion surveys on nuclear issues===
{{Main|Public opinion on nuclear issues}}
In 2005, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the ''Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues'' report.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt;  Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist acts involving radioactive materials]] at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt; Stressing the [[climate change]] benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=IAE&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (2005). [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409124139/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf |date=9 April 2008 }} pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black  |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nuclear Environmentalist.jpg|alt=Stewart Brand wearing a shirt bearing the radioactive trefoil symbol with the caption "Rad."|thumb|right|Stewart Brand at a 2010 debate, "Does the world need nuclear energy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/debate_does_the_world_need_nuclear_energy.html |title=Stewart Brand + Mark Z. Jacobson: Debate: Does the world need nuclear energy? |date=February 2010 |website=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Attempts to reach political agreement on effective [[climate change policy|policies for climate change]] continue, and pro-nuclear environmentalists seek to reverse the traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of environmentalists. Filmmaker Rob Stone's ''[[Pandora's Promise]]'' (2013) is a good example of this trend.&lt;ref&gt;van Munster R, Sylvest C. 
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26593709 Pro-Nuclear Environmentalism: Should We Learn to Stop Worrying and Love Nuclear Energy?] ''[[Technology and Culture]], 2015 Oct 56(4):789–811. doi: 10.1353/tech.2015.0107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmentalists criticise the anti-nuclear movement for under-stating the [[Effects of global warming|environmental costs of fossil fuels]] and non-nuclear alternatives, and overstating the environmental costs of nuclear energy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolo.org/media/articles/articles.in.english/love-indep-24-05-04.htm |title=James Lovelock: Nuclear power is the only green solution|website=www.ecolo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401209.html |title=Going Nuclear|first=Patrick|last=Moore|date=16 April 2006|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the numerous nuclear experts who have offered their expertise in addressing controversies, [[Bernard Cohen (physicist)|Bernard Cohen]], Professor Emeritus of Physics at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], is likely the most frequently cited.  In his extensive writings he examines the safety issues in detail.  He is best known for comparing nuclear safety to the relative safety of a wide range of other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/ |title=Bernard Cohen]|website=www.phyast.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/BOOK.html |title=The Nuclear Energy Option|first=Bernard L|last=Cohen|website=www.phyast.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear activists are accused of encouraging [[Radiophobia|radiophobic]] emotions among the public. ''The War Against the Atom'' (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for about 100 deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel MacCracken, ''The War Against the Atom'', 1982, Basic Books, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuclear Energy Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/ Nuclear Energy Institute] website&lt;/ref&gt; (NEI) is the main lobby group for companies doing nuclear work in the United States, while most countries that employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. The [[World Nuclear Association]] is the only global trade body.  In seeking to counteract the arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and benefits of alternatives.  NEI sponsors studies of its own, but it also references studies performed for the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health: Budapest, Hungary, 23–25 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[International Energy Agency]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://ww.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf Executive Summary]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Rabl and Mona. Dreicer, Health and Environmental Impacts of Energy Systems.  ''International Journal of Global Energy Issues'', vol.18(2/3/4), 113–150 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required for nuclear power.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, criticise the movement on the basis of the claim that [[Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|nuclear power is necessary]] for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; originator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; a co-founder of [[Greenpeace]] and former director of Greenpeace International, [[George Monbiot]] and [[Stewart Brand]], creator of the [[Whole Earth Catalog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/16398/ |title=Environmental Heresies|first=Stewart|last=Brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/science/earth/27tier.html?ex=1330405200&amp;en=e561a6494b06049d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg|title=Stewart Brand - John Tierney - An Early Environmentalist, Embracing New ‘Heresies’|first=John|last=Tierney|date=27 February 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/|title=James LOVELOCK's web site - the international homepage|first=Bruno|last=Comby|website=www.ecolo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html|title=Technology News|website=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-nuclear organisations have acknowledged that their positions are subject to review.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-22-nuclear-power_N.htm Some rethinking nuke opposition] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, [[Dan Becker]], Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club, declared, "Switching from dirty coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and taking up crack."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstrib.com/featured-series/energy-series/Articles/A_7-20-2007_1_4.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Lovelock criticizes holders of such a view: "Opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the media."  ". . .I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

[[George Monbiot]], an English writer known for his environmental and political activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;George Monbiot [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2000/mar/30/energy.nuclearindustry?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "The nuclear winter draws near"], ''The Guardian'', 30 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011. Although he "still loathe[s] the liars who run the nuclear industry",&lt;ref name="Monbiot2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima/|title=Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=21 March 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monbiot now advocates its use, having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Japan tsunami]] on nuclear reactors in the region.&lt;ref name="Monbiot2011"/&gt; Subsequently, he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement, writing that it "has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health ... made [claims] ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong." He singled out [[Helen Caldicott]] for, he wrote, making unsourced and inaccurate claims, dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up, and overstating the death toll from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] by a factor of more than 140.&lt;ref name="Monbiot2011-2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2011/04/04/evidence-meltdown/|title=Evidence Meltdown|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=4 April 2011|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409001858/http://www.monbiot.com/2011/04/04/evidence-meltdown/|archivedate=9 April 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arecibo message''' is a 1974 [[interstellar radio message]] carrying basic information about humanity and Earth sent to [[Great Globular Cluster in Hercules|globular star cluster M13]] in the hope that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial intelligence]] might receive and decipher it. The message was [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] into space a single time via [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] [[radio waves]] at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] in [[Puerto Rico]] on 16 November 1974.&lt;ref name="phoneet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/Arecibo.message.ws.html |title=Cornell News: It's the 25th anniversary of Earth's first (and only) attempt to phone E.T. |date=Nov 12, 1999|accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802005337/http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Nov99/Arecibo.message.ws.html |archivedate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20170628"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Steven |title=Greetings, E.T.

The "ones" and "zeros" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second. The total broadcast was less than three minutes.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jay M.

The number 1,679 was chosen because it is a [[semiprime]] (the product of two [[prime number]]s), to be [[raster scan|arranged rectangularly]] as 73 rows by 23 columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker |first1=John |title=Self-Decoding Messages - The Arecibo Message |url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/circulos_cultivos/chilbolton01.htm |website=bibliotecapleyades.net |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:File:AreciboMessageShifted.svg|The alternative arrangement]], 23 rows by 73 columns, produces an unintelligible set of characters (as do all other X/Y formats).

Dr. [[Frank Drake]], then at [[Cornell University]] and creator of the [[Drake equation]], wrote the message with help from [[Carl Sagan]], among others.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt; The message consists of seven parts that encode the following (from the top down):&lt;ref name=cassiday/&gt;
#The numbers one (1) to ten (10) (white)
#The [[atomic numbers]] of the elements [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[phosphorus]], which make up [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) (purple)
#The [[formula]]s for the [[sugar]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] in the [[nucleotides]] of DNA (green)
#The number of nucleotides in DNA, and a graphic of the double helix structure of DNA (white &amp; blue)
#A graphic figure of a human, the dimension (physical height) of an average man, and the human population of Earth (red,  blue/white, &amp; white respectively)
#A graphic of the [[Solar System]] indicating which of the planets the message is coming from (yellow)
#A graphic of the [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]] and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dish (purple, white, &amp; blue)

Since it will take nearly 25,000 years for the message to reach its intended destination (and an additional 25,000 years for any reply), the Arecibo message is viewed as a demonstration of human technological achievement, rather than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials. In fact, the core of M13, to which the message was aimed, will no longer be in that location when the message arrives.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt; However, as the [[proper motion]] of M13 is small, the message will still arrive near the center of the cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/comments/28100/In_regard_to_the_email_from |title=In regard to the email from |author=Dave Deamer |date=December 4, 2009 |publisher=Science 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Cornell News'' press release of November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact but to demonstrate the capabilities of newly installed equipment.&lt;ref name="phoneet" /&gt;

On 16 November 2018, [[Google]] released a Doodle to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=44th Anniversary of Arecibo Message #GoogleDoodle|url=https://g.co/doodle/7vsgsf|work=[[Google]]}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

===Numbers===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 1.png|Part 1 — The numbers from 1 to 10|right]]

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10
 ----------------------
 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 00 00 00
 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 00 00 10
 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 01 11 01
 X X X X X X X X  X  X &lt;-least-significant-digit marker

The numbers from [[1 (number)|1]] to [[10 (number)|10]] appear in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] format (the bottom row marks the beginning of each number).

Even assuming that recipients would recognize binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious because of the way they have been written. To read the first seven digits, ignore the bottom row, and read them as three binary digits from top to bottom, with the top digit being the most significant. The readings for 8, 9 and 10 are a little different, as they have been given an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image). This is intended to show that numbers too large to fit in a single column can be written in several contiguous ones, where the additional columns do not have the least-significant-digit marker.

=== DNA elements ===

The numbers 1, 6, 7, 8, and 15 appear. These are the [[atomic numbers]] of [[hydrogen]] (H), [[carbon]] (C), [[nitrogen]] (N), [[oxygen]] (O), and [[phosphorus]] (P), the components of DNA.

The [[nucleotides]] are described as sequences of the five atoms that appear on the preceding line. Each sequence represents the [[molecular formula]] of the nucleotide as incorporated into DNA (as opposed to the free form of the nucleotide).

For example, deoxyribose (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O in DNA, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; when free), the nucleotide in the top left in the image, is read as:

 11000
 10000
 11010
 XXXXX
 -----
 75010

i.e., 7 atoms of hydrogen, 5 atoms of carbon, 0 atoms of nitrogen, 1 atom of oxygen, and 0 atoms of phosphorus.

DNA double [[helix]]; the vertical bar represents the number of nucleotides. The value depicted is around 4.3 billion, which was believed to be the case in 1974 when the message was transmitted. It is currently thought that there are about 3.2 billion base pairs in the human [[genome]].

===Humanity===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 5.png|Part 5 — Human form, the height and population of humans|right]]

   ʌ             X011011

   v              110000

 1110 (binary) = 14 (decimal)

 000011 111111 110111 111011 111111 110110 (binary)
 = 4,292,853,750 (decimal)

The element in the center represents a human. The element on the left (in the image) indicates the average height of an adult male: {{cvt|1.764|m|ftin|1}}. This corresponds to the horizontally written binary 14 multiplied by the [[wavelength]] of the message (126&amp;nbsp;mm). The element on the right depicts the size of human population in 1974, around 4.3&amp;nbsp;billion (which, coincidentally, is within 0.1% of the number of DNA nucleotides). In this case, the number is oriented in the data horizontally rather than vertically. The least-significant-digit marker is in the upper left in the image, with bits going to the right and more significant digits below.

===Planets===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 6.png|Part 6 — The Sun and the planets|left]]

                   Earth
 Sun Mercury Venus       Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto

The [[solar system]], showing the [[Sun]] and the planets in the order of their position from the [[Sun]]: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]]. (Pluto has since been [[Pluto#IAU classification|reclassified]] as a [[dwarf planet]] by the [[International Astronomical Union]], but it was still considered a planet at the time the message was transmitted.)

The Earth is the third planet from the [[Sun]]; its graphic is shifted up to identify it as the planet from which the signal was sent. Additionally, the human figure is shown just above the Earth graphic.

In addition to showing position, the graphic provides a general, not-to-scale size reference of each planet and the Sun.

===Telescope===
[[Image:Arecibo message part 7.png|Part 7 — The Arecibo radio telescope|left]]

 bottom two rows:
      100101
 &lt;--- 111110X ---&gt;

 100101 111110 (binary) = 2,430 (decimal)

{{clr}}

The last part represents the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] with its [[diameter]]: 2,430 multiplied by the wavelength gives {{cvt|306.18|m|ftin|0}}. In this case, the number is oriented horizontally, with the least-significant-digit marker to the lower right in the image. The part of the image that looks like a letter "M" is there to demonstrate to the reader of the message that the curved line is a [[paraboloid]] mirror.

[[Image:AreciboMessageShifted.svg|The Arecibo message as decoded into 23 rows and 73 columns. Although unintelligible, the message in this format appears sufficiently organized to show that it is not a random signal.|thumb|right]]

An important part of communicating in a bias-free manner is by making sure you are engaging in meaningful conversations, using bias-free language. Your use of words is vital in terms of effectively communicating in ways that you do not offend the person you are talking to. According to Locker, "Bias-free language is language that is sensitive to people's sex, race, age, physical condition and many other categories. Bias-free language does not discriminate and therefore includes all readers in a fair and friendly manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/CC3BFEEB-C364-E1A1-A5390F221AC0FD2D/bias-free_language.pdf|title=Bias-free Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">'''Computational social science''' refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the [[social science]]s. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena.  Fields include [[computational economics]], [[computational sociology]], [[cliodynamics]], [[culturomics]],  and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through [[social simulation]], modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://computationalsocialscience.org/|title=The Computational Social Science Society of the Americas official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There are two terminologies that relate to each other: '''Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS)'''. In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena.
On the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena.

Computational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the [[scientific method]]: [[empirical research]], especially through [[big data]], by analyzing the [[digital footprint]] left behind through social online activities; and [[scientific theory]], especially through [[computer simulation]] model building through [[social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;DT&amp;SC 7-1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x3d75ZMuYU .

A '''conflict atlas''', also called '''conflict partiture''', is a [[graphics|graphical]] representation of the development of a particular [[Conflict resolution|conflict]]. The graph shows important events, appointments, and their interlinkage over time. 

This instrument has been mentioned in F. Glasl's book Konfliktmanagement (2004).

The [[Military Police Corps (United States)|United States Army Military Police Corps]] defines criminal intelligence in more detail; '''criminal intelligence''' is information gathered or collated, analyzed, recorded/reported and disseminated by law enforcement agencies concerning types of [[crime]], identified criminals and known or suspected criminal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm;jsessionid=2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ!99557122|title=Field Manual (FM) 3-19.50 - Police Intelligence Operations (2006)|work=rdl.train.army.mil|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720002859/https://rdl.train.army.mil/soldierPortal/atia/adlsc/view/public/22739-1/FM/3-19.50/chap4.htm%3Bjsessionid%3D2Dp2J7GTSyJPCJpXR821z1Mvh17s0z9VsGLgtBMJLwv2DTyngKbZ%2199557122|archivedate=2011-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly useful when dealing with [[organized crime]]. Criminal intelligence is developed by using [[surveillance]], [[informant]]s, [[interrogation]], and [[research]], or may be just picked up on the "street" by individual [[police]] officers.

Some larger law enforcement agencies have a department, division or section specifically designed to gather disparate pieces of information and develop criminal intelligence. One of the most effective ways of applying criminal intelligence is first to record it (store in a [[computer]] system) which can be "mined" (searched) for specific information.

==US Army usage==
Criminal intelligence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRIMINT is the result of the collection, analysis, and interpretation of all available information concerning known and potential [[criminal]] threats and vulnerabilities of supported organizations. Army law enforcement agencies are the primary liaison representatives of the Army to federal, state, local, and host nation (HN) agencies for exchanging police intelligence. They collect criminal intelligence (''CRIMINT'') and human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) within the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations. Army law enforcement agencies have the capability to analyze and disseminate collected time-sensitive information concerning a criminal threat against Army interests. The value of such intelligence cannot be overemphasized; it not only serves the purpose of police investigations, it also contributes to the development of countermeasures to safeguard Army personnel, materials, information, and other resources.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"&gt;FM 3-19.13 LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==CRIMINT Process==
The CRIMINT process is effective intelligence results from a series of interrelated activities. The intelligence process is a continuous process of collecting and converting data into [[intelligence]] products to be integrated into operations. The process consists of several phases with continuous evaluation and feedback at each phase and at the end of the process. With the minor modification of adding “reporting” to the second phase, the following text outlines the intelligence process as discussed in Army Regulation (AR) 525-13.

* CRIMINT planning and directing.
* CRIMINT collection and reporting.
* CRIMINT processing.
* Analysis and production.
* Dissemination and integration.&lt;ref name="FM 3-19.13"/&gt;

== Criminal intelligence analysis ==
''Criminal intelligence analysis'' has been recognized by law enforcement as a useful support tool for over twenty-five years and is successfully used within the international community. International organizations, such as the International Police ([[INTERPOL]]), European Police ([[EUROPOL]]) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), and while there are many definitions of Criminal Intelligence Analysis in use throughout the world, the one definition agreed in June 1992 by an international group of twelve European INTERPOL member countries and subsequently adopted by other countries is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of and provision of insight into the relationship between crime data and other potentially relevant data with a view to police and judicial practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20071005230215/http://www.interpol.int/Public/cia/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-10-05|title=International Police (INTERPOL) (2010)|work=interpol.int|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, criminal intelligence is a more intense or specific application towards investigations than [[criminology]].

== Criminal investigation analysis software ==
There are several techniques intended for criminal investigation analysis. One of them is [[link analysis]] which is dedicated to evaluate relationships between nodes. In this specific category there are several applications such as IBM i2 that provides integrated tools to support crime investigators and next-generation, single platforms as DataWalk that imports, integrates and links structured and unstructured data at massive scale for further visual analysis, investigation and collaboration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8788">'''Deep Springs International''' (DSI) is a US [[nonprofit corporation]], headquartered in [[Léogâne]], [[Haiti]], which supports the establishment and expansion of Gadyen Dlo social enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/organizations/20-5036775/deep-springs-international.aspx |title=Nonprofit Report for Deep Springs International, Inc |publisher=.guidestar.org |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadyen Dlo has been produced and distributed in Haiti since 2002, originally supported by Emory University and the US Centers for Disease Control.

'''Gadyen Dlo''' ([[Haitian Creole]] for "Water Guardian") is a Haitian produced 0.7% [[sodium hypochlorite]] liquid solution used to [[water chlorination|chlorinate]] drinking water at "point of use." Gadyen Dlo is produced at four sites throughout Haiti (West, Northwest, North, and South Departments). Gadyen Dlo is distributed to households in refillable bottles, preferably along with safe water storage containers (5 gallon plastic buckets with taps, lids, and instructions with pictures and Creole).

Several studies by [[MIT]] and Emory University have consistently shown that 65 – 85% of households had positive chlorine residual at the time of an unannounced visit. An evaluation in 2007 revealed 76% of tests conducted by technicians showed positive chlorine residual, and there was no significant decrease in correct use after more than three years of families’ entrance into the program. An independent evaluation in 2010 among 706 children under 5 documented a reduction in diarrhoeal disease incidence of 51%.

== Household distribution ==
As of November 2010, the Gadyen Dlo household distribution program reaches almost 40,000 households and an estimated 20,408 children under 5 with continuous provision of Gadyen Dlo. These households are located primarily in rural areas throughout eight of the ten departments of Haiti. There are four chlorine production sites, fifteen distinct project sites, and a total of 230 distributors throughout all of these sites. Gadyen Dlo works with a variety of models in which distributors are compensated through structures ranging from full-time employees to part-time employees who conduct other community health services to vendors who simply resell products for a margin. These programs are supported by [[INGO]]s, churches, individuals, and corporate donors.

== Wholesale distribution ==
In 2010 alone, the Wholesale Program has delivered 13,669 L (3,611 gallons) of Gadyen Dlo to treat 48,505,526 L (12,813,805 gallons) of water. These deliveries have been made to and distributed by partners including DINEPA ([[Water supply and sanitation in Haiti|Haiti's Ministry of Water and Sanitation]]), UNICEF, United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti ([[MINUSTAH]]), and [[Samaritan's Purse]]. Additionally, 4,541 household safe water storage containers have been delivered to these partners, which will serve 20,889 Haitians. These distributions are typically accompanied by a training session for the partner organization's staff and distributors on hygiene promotion, distribution methods, and effective use of Gadyen Dlo.

== Dispensers ==
In partnership with [[Innovations for Poverty Action]] and [[Harvard University]], DSI is implementing a chlorine dispensers pilot project in the Grand-Goâve commune in Haiti that dispenses Gadyen Dlo "at source."

== Press ==
In addition to being the 2008 [[Templeton Freedom Awards]] recipient for Social Entrepreneurship, DSI and Gadyen Dlo have been recently recognized in the following media outlets:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media Lab Asia''' (MLAsia) was founded in 2001 as a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit research entity]] as a result of cooperation between the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]] of the [[Government of India]]. The objectives of MLAsia are to bring the benefits of [[Information and communications technology]] (ICT) to the people in Asia and around the world.

==Research focus==
Media Lab Asia started with the projects such as World Computer (affordable computing and access devices), Bits for All (low cost, high bandwidth connectivity) and Tomorrow's Tool (rurally relevant applications). It later switched to application development, including ICT for Healthcare, Education, Livelihood and Empowerment of Disabled. Since then, MLAsia has taken up 75 development projects. After development, the new technology is taken from the lab to pilot testing, and then for large scale deployment through a scheme of provider/user membership.

==Functional model==
MLAsia utilizes a way of growth by working with a network of  research academic and private organizations for undertaking development work. It serves as a research hub for the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs). The other partners are a combination of academic and industry R&amp;D institutions, NGOs and governmental agencies. The projects are sponsored by corporate bodies, non-profits and the government. The list of project partners has grown to more than 58.

[[File:Eglantyne Jebb 1920.jpg|thumb|Eglantyne Jebb]]
'''Eglantyne Jebb,'''  (25 August 1876 – 17 December 1928) was a British [[reform movement|social reformer]] and founder of the [[Save the Children]] organisation.

== Early life ==
She was born in 1876 in [[Ellesmere, Shropshire]], and grew up on her family's estate. The Jebbs were a well-off family and had a strong social conscience and commitment to public service. Her mother, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], had founded the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]], to promote Arts and Crafts among young people in rural areas; her sister Louisa would help found the [[Women's Land Army]] in [[World War I]]. Another sister, [[Dorothy Frances Jebb]], who married the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Charles Roden Buxton]], campaigned against the demonisation of the German people after the war.
She also served a faculty member at [[Wellesley College]] in 1929, teaching courses in English literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley College, [http://repository.wellesley.edu/news/796 "The Wellesley News (05-31-1928)"] (1928). ''The Wellesley News''. Book 796.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nickname ==
She was known as the "White Flame" because the flame of her [[philanthropy|dedicated love]] for children in distress burned to a white heat of passion all her life.

== Social activism ==
Having studied history at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford - Prominent Alumni|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jebb trained to become a school teacher, but a year's experience as a Primary School teacher, at St. Peter's Junior School in Marlborough, convinced her that this was not her vocation, though it increased her awareness of the difficulties and widespread nature of poverty faced by young children.

She moved to [[Cambridge]] to look after her sick mother. There she became involved in the [[Charity Organisation Society]], which aimed to bring a modern scientific approach to charity work. This led her to carry out an extensive research project into conditions in the city, and in 1906 she published a book, ''Cambridge, a Study in Social Questions'' based on her research.

The Cambridge Independent Press, a weekly liberal-supporting newspaper published a number of articles covering Eglantyne's campaigning and political activities in Cambridge in the run up to the First World War. She was appointed to the Education Committee of Cambridge Borough Council in 1907, although in her first year only attended 13 of a possible 31 meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=8 November 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also on the committee of the newly formed League for Physical Education and Improvement, but resigned citing pressures from other workloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|issue=17 May 1907|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=17 May 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the watchful eye of [[Florence Ada Keynes]] Eglantyne and Florence's daughter Margaret set up and ran the Boy's employment registry, shortly followed by a similar one for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambridge Independent Press|publisher=Cambridge Independent Press|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a Blue Plaque above 82 Regent Street where the employment registry was sited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulley|first1=Clare|url=http://www.claremulley.com/blog/28-december-2014/|title=Blue Plaque-tastic!|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 she was asked to undertake a journey to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] on behalf of the Macedonian Relief Fund. She returned shortly before the First World War broke out, and soon was drawn into a project organised by Dorothy, who had begun importing European newspapers – including ones from Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] for which a special licence had to be obtained from the government – and publishing extracts in English in the ''Cambridge Magazine'', which revealed that everyday life in the enemy countries was far worse than government propaganda suggested.

As the war was coming to an end, and the German and Austro-Hungarian economies came near to collapse, it was clear to Dorothy and Eglantyne that the children of these countries were suffering appallingly from the effects of the war and the [[Blockade of Germany|Allied blockade]], which continued even when an armistice was signed. A pressure group, the Fight the Famine Council, was set up in 1919 to persuade the British government to end the blockade.

== Save the Children ==
Soon, however, the focus shifted to organising relief. On 15 April 1919, the Council set up a fund to raise money for the German and Austrian children – the [[Save the Children Fund]]. Unexpectedly, this organisation, launched at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London on 19 May 1919, quickly raised a large sum of money from the British public, and officials were despatched to organise relief work.

The success of the Fund led Eglantyne and Dorothy to attempt to set up an international movement for children. The [[International Save the Children Union]] (''Union International de Secours à l'Enfant'') was founded in [[Geneva]] in 1920, with the British [[Save the Children Fund]] and the Swedish [[Rädda Barnen]] as leading members.

In London, it was now Eglantyne who was in charge, and she ensured that the Fund adopted the professional approach she had learnt in the Charity Organisation Society. A manager, Lewis Golden, was recruited to put the organisation on a businesslike foundation. He adopted the innovative – and controversial – approach of taking full-page advertisements in national newspapers; it was highly effective, and raised very substantial amounts of income for the Fund's work.

As the problems in central Europe receded, there was a new focus of the Fund's attention – a refugee crisis in [[Greece]] and the surrounding areas, a consequence of the continuing conflict in the area. Then in 1921, just as this situation was coming under control, there was a new and bigger emergency. Partly as a consequence of the devastation of war, revolution and civil war, and partly due to the disastrous economic policies of the [[Bolshevik]] government, the people of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] faced a [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]] as crops failed. A new fundraising effort brought a surge of donations, and a Save the Children team was dispatched to the city of [[Saratov]], one of the main famine centres.

== Declaration of the Rights of the Child ==
In all the work the Fund did, a major element in Eglantyne's thinking was the importance of a planned, research-based approach. In 1923, when the Russian relief effort was coming to an end, and the Fund's income was sharply reducing, she turned to another issue – that of children's rights. She headed to Geneva, to a meeting of the International Union, with a plan for a Children's Charter. The result was a short and clear document – drafted by Eglantyne – which asserted the rights of children and the duty of the international community to put children's rights in the forefront of planning. The [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]], or the Declaration of Geneva as it came to be known, was adopted a year later by the [[League of Nations]].

With peace returning to Europe, and relief efforts in decline, the focus of the Save the Children movement shifted to promoting the Declaration. In 1925, the first International Child Welfare congress was held in Geneva. The Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments. An expanded version would be adopted by the United Nations in 1959, and it was one of the main inspirations behind the 1989 UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Death and legacy ==
After many years of ill health due to a thyroid problem, including three operations for [[goitre]], Eglantyne Jebb died in a nursing home in Geneva in 1928, and is buried there in St George's cemetery. [[Save the Children]], which she and her sister [[Dorothy Buxton|Dorothy]] (who converted to the [[Society of Friends]] with her husband) founded in England in 1919 and as an international organisation based in Geneva the following year, remains active today. Also, the [[Church of England]] remembers her life and service annually on its [[Calendar of saints (Church of England)|liturgical calendar]] on 17 December.

'''Female perversion''' is a term coined by [[Estela V. Welldon]] in 1992 to refer to women who commit violence, either against themselves or against others.&lt;ref name=Welldon&gt;Welldon, E.V. 1991 ''Psychology and psychopathology in women - a psychoanalytic perspective'', '''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''' 158 pg 85-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madonna&gt;[[Estela V. Welldon|Welldon, E.V.]] 1992 ''Mother, Madonna, Whore: The Idealization and Denigration of Motherhood'' [[Free Association Books]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the term can be used [[pejorative]]ly and sometimes has sexual connotations, its strict definition is an instance of [[human behavior]] that deviates from what is considered [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or [[normality (behavior)|normal]], and it is in this sense that the term is used by psychologists. The term is also controversial as according to Welldon there is a prevailing denial of the existence of female violence, throughout the legal and mental health community.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body {{ISBN|978-0415126755}}'' pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model of female perversion==
Welldon (1992)&lt;ref name="Madonna" /&gt; put forward a model of female perversion that introduced the term into the psychological nomenclature. The model covers several categories of violent behavior that can be directed at one's own body, against children, or against adults.

Freudian psychoanalytic theory suggested that perversion fell solely within the male domain, that it was related to the [[phallus]], and that aggressive drive was unique to men. In her book ''Madonna, Whore: The Idealisation and Denigration of Motherhood'',&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt; Welldon challenges this notion, and argues that women are equally capable of perversion. Though they do not use the [[penis]] with violence, they instead use the whole body.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In doing so, they attack the whole body, and sometimes by extension the bodies of children. They are symbolically wreaking revenge on their own internalised, often cruel and perverse mother. They identify their own body with the body of the mother. Likewise when they attack their children, they express violence towards a [[narcissistic]] extension of themselves" (Motz, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The major forms it can manifest itself are &lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[self-harm]]
* [[eating disorders]]
* physical and sexual abuse of children
* [[infanticide]]
* [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]]
* physical or sexual assault of others, including battered women who kill
 
Welldon argues that it can be seen as a form of sexualised aggression, and challenges the Freudian view that violence is a uniquely male phallic expression.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The reproductive functions and organs are used by both sexes to express perversion. Perverse men use their penises to attack and show hatred towards symbolic sources of humiliation..... If perversion in the man is focused through his penis, in the woman it will similarly expressed through her reproductive organs and the maternal representations of motherhood

(Welldon 1991) &lt;ref name="Welldon" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anna Motz]], in her book ''The psychology of female violence'' suggests that the expression of this anger on the body or that of another is a communicative act, clearly sending a message of internal pain or of psychosis (Motz, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; She calls the message "the language of the body", and that the symbolic use of violence against the body can be likened to psychosomatic illness.

===Violence against the self===

Violence against the self can take several forms, including deprivation and starvation as is the case in [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]], [[self-injury]] or suicide attempts, or other forms of self-harm.

===Violence against children===

Violence against children often goes unreported, and is largely hidden from view. It can take the form of direct physical or sexual assault, [[Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy]], or [[infanticide]]. Often the capacity of women to commit violence against children is denied, in the refusal to 'think the unthinkable'.&lt;ref&gt;Motz, Anna 2001 ''The psychology of female violence: crimes against the body'' pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against adults===
Violence against others can take many forms, from domestic assault, physical assault, and when it escalates in the form of [[homicide]] and/or [[infanticide]].

A '''festival''' is an event ordinarily celebrated by a [[community]] and centering on some characteristic aspect of that community and its [[religion]] or [[culture]]s. It is often marked as a local or national [[holiday]], [[mela]], or [[Muslim holidays|eid]]. Next to religion and [[folklore]], a significant origin is [[agriculture|agricultural]]. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with [[harvest]] time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in [[autumn]], such as [[Halloween]] in the northern hemisphere and [[Easter]] in the southern.

Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or thanksgiving. The celebrations offer a sense of belonging for religious, social, or geographical groups, contributing to [[group cohesiveness]]. They may also provide [[entertainment]], which was particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of [[old age|elders]] sharing stories and experience provides a means for unity among [[family|families]].

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], festivals such as the [[Saturnalia]] were closely associated with social organisation and political processes as well as religion.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Noel|title=Festivals and legends: the formation of Greek cities in the light of public ritual|year=1992|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0802059880|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandt|first=edited by J.

The [[Philippines]] is one example of a modern society with a large number of festivals, as each day of the year has at least one specific celebration. There are more than 42,000 known major and minor festivals in the country, the majority of which are specific to the [[barangay]] (village) level.&lt;ref name="Picard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Picard|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Mike|editor=David Picard and Mike Robinson|title=Festivals, Tourism and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=[[Channel View Publications]]|isbn=978-1-84541-267-8|pages=1–3|chapter=Remaking Worlds: Festivals, Tourism and Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Alexander van Bredael - A Festival in Antwerp.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|A Festival at [[Antwerp]], 17th century]]
[[File:Ländliches Fest in Schwaben.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.10|Country Festival in [[Swabia]]]]
The word "festival" was originally used as an adjective from the late fourteenth century, deriving from [[Latin]] via [[Old French]].&lt;ref name=oed1&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69567 festival, adj. and n.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]], a "festival dai" was a religious holiday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED15806&amp;egs=all festival (adj.)] at the [[Middle English Dictionary]]. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first recorded used as a noun was in 1589 (as "Festifall").&lt;ref name=oed1/&gt; Feast first came into usage as a noun circa 1200,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68799 feast, n.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and its first recorded use as a verb was circa 1300.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68800 feast, v.]". [[OED Online]]. March 2014. Oxford University Press. Accessed April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "feast" is also used in common [[secular]] [[idiom|parlance]] as a synonym for any large or elaborate [[meal]]. When used as in the meaning of a festival, most often refers to a [[religious festival]] rather than a film or art festival. In the [[Philippines]] and many other former Spanish colonies, the Spanish word '''fiesta''' is used to denote a communal religious feast to honor a [[patron saint]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Traditions==
Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious significance in traditional activities. The most important religious festivals such as [[Christmas]], [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Diwali]], and [[Eid al-Adha]] serve to mark out the year. Others, such as [[harvest festival]]s, celebrate seasonal change. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. An early example is the festival established by [[Ancient Egypt]]ian Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] celebrating his victory over the Libyans.&lt;ref name=Berrett&gt;{{cite book|last=Berrett|first=LaMar C.|title=Discovering the world of the Bible|year=1996|publisher=Grandin Book Co.|location=Provo, Utah|isbn=0-910523-52-5|page=289|edition=3rd ed., rev.|author2=Ogden D. Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many countries, royal holidays commemorate dynastic events just as agricultural holidays are about harvests. Festivals are often commemorated annually.

There are numerous [[Outline of festivals#Types of festivals|types of festivals]] in the world and most countries celebrate important events or traditions with traditional cultural events and activities. Most culminate in the consumption of specially prepared food (showing the connection to "feasting") and they bring people together. Festivals are also strongly associated with national holidays. Lists of national festivals are published to make participation easier.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [[List of festivals in Australia]]; [[List of festivals in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]; [[List of festivals in Canada|Canada]]; [[Traditional Chinese holidays|China]]; [[List of festivals in Colombia|Colombia]]; [[List of festivals in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]]; [[List of festivals in Fiji|Fiji]]; [[Public holidays in India|India]]; [[List of festivals in Indonesia|Indonesia]]; [[List of festivals in Iran|Iran]]; [[List of festivals in Japan|Japan]]; [[List of festivals in Laos|Laos]]; [[List of festivals in Morocco|Morocco]]; [[List of festivals in Nepal|Nepal]]; [[List of festivals in Pakistan|Pakistan]]; [[List of festivals in the Philippines|Philippines]]; [[List of festivals in Romania|Romania]]; [[List of festivals in Tunisia|Tunisia]]; [[List of festivals in Turkey|Turkey]]; [[List of festivals in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]; [[List of festivals in the United States|United States]]; [[List of festivals in Vietnam|Vietnam]].

Among many [[religion]]s, a feast is a set of celebrations in honour of [[Gods]] or [[God]].&lt;ref name=Bleeker&gt;Ancient Egyptian festivals could be either religious or political.{{cite book|last=Bleeker|first=C. J.|title=Egyptian festivals. Enactments of religious renewal|date=1967 [1968]|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, The Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feast and a festival are historically interchangeable. Most religions have festivals that recur annually and some, such as [[Passover]], Easter and Eid al-Adha are [[moveable feast]]s – that is, those that are determined either by lunar or agricultural cycles or the calendar in use at the time. The [[Sed festival]], for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian [[pharaoh]]'s rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heb-Sed (Egyptian feast)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/258986/Heb-Sed|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian]] [[liturgical calendar]], there are two principal feasts, properly known as the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord (Christmas) and the Feast of the Resurrection, (Easter). In the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgical calendars there are a great number of lesser feasts throughout the year commemorating saints, sacred events or doctrines. In the [[Philippines]], each day of the year has at least one specific religious festival, either from Catholic, Islamic, or indigenous origins.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religious festivals, such as [[Esala Perahera]] are held in Sri Lanka and Thailand.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerson|first=Ruth|title=Traditional festivals in Thailand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Kuala Lumpur; New York|isbn=9676531111}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Sindhi festivals|Hindu festivals]], such as [[Holi]] are very ancient.

===Arts festivals===
{{main|Arts festival}}

Among the many offspring of general arts festivals are also more specific types of festivals, including ones that showcase intellectual or creative achievement such as [[science festival]]s, [[literary festival]]s and [[music festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of music festivals]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sub-categories include [[comedy festival]]s, [[rock festival]]s, [[List of jazz festivals|jazz festivals]] and [[buskers festival]]s; [[poetry]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;Some such as such as [[Cúirt International Festival of Literature]] started as a poetry festival and then broadened in scope.&lt;/ref&gt; [[theatre festival]]s, and [[storytelling festival]]s; and re-enactment festivals such as [[Renaissance fair]]s. In the [[Philippines]], aside from numerous art festivals scattered throughout the year, February is known as national arts month, the culmination of all art festivals in the entire archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasilag|first=Giselle P.|date=February 1999|title=Performances, exhibits around the country mark National Arts Month|url=|journal=BusinessWorld (SanJuan, Philippines)|volume=|pages=1|issn=0116-3930|via=Nexis Uni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Film festival]]s involve the screenings of several different films, and are usually held annually. Some of the most significant film festivals include the [[Berlin International Film Festival]], the [[Venice Film Festival]] and the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

===Food and drink festivals===
{{main|Food festival}}
A food festival is an event celebrating food or drink. These often highlight the output of producers from a certain region. Some food festivals are focused on a particular item of food, such as the [[National Peanut Festival]] in the United States, or the [[Galway International Oyster Festival]] in Ireland. There are also specific beverage festivals, such as the famous [[Oktoberfest]] in Germany for [[Beer festival|beer]]. Many countries hold festivals to celebrate [[wine festival|wine]]. One example is the global celebration of the arrival of [[Beaujolais nouveau]], which involves shipping the new wine around the world for its release date on the third Thursday of November each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyslop|first=Leah|title=Beaujolais Nouveau day: 10 facts about the wine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/wine/10465236/Beaujolais-Nouveau-day-10-facts-about-the-wine.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haine2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=W.

In the Philippines, there are at least two hundred festivals dedicated to food and drinks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Seasonal and harvest festivals===
Seasonal festivals, such as [[Beltane]], are determined by the [[solar calendar|solar]] and the [[lunar calendar]]s and by the cycle of the [[season]]s, especially because of its effect on food supply, as a result of which there is a [[list of harvest festivals|wide range]] of ancient and modern [[harvest festival]]s. Ancient Egyptians relied upon the seasonal [[inundation]] caused by the [[Nile River]], a form of [[irrigation]], which provided fertile land for crops.&lt;ref name="Bunson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunson|first=Margaret|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6EJ0G-4jyoC&amp;pg=PA277|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0997-8|page=278|chapter=Nile festivals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Alps]], in autumn the return of the cattle from the mountain [[pasture]]s to the stables in the valley is celebrated as ''[[Almabtrieb]]''. A recognized winter festival, the [[Chinese New Year]], is set by the lunar calendar, and celebrated from the day of the second new moon after the [[Dongzhi (solar term)|winter solstice]]. [[Dree Festival]] of the Apatanis living in Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh is celebrated every year from July 4 to 7 by praying for a bumper crop harvest.&lt;ref name="GoAP PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|title=Press release – Dree festival|date=5 July 2004|publisher=Directorate of Information, Govt of Arunachal Pradesh|accessdate=2009-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718153132/http://arunachalpradesh.nic.in/press/04-05/050704a.htm|archive-date=July 18, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midsummer]] or St John's Day, is an example of a seasonal festival, related to the [[feast day]] of a Christian saint as well as a celebration of the time of the [[summer solstice]] in the northern hemisphere, where it is particularly important in Sweden. [[Winter carnival]]s also provide the opportunity to utilise to celebrate creative or sporting activities requiring snow and ice. In the [[Philippines]], each day of the year has at least one festival dedicated to harvesting of crops, fishes, crustaceans, milk, and other local goods.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Four-sides-model en.svg|thumb|upright=2|&lt;center&gt;Graphic of the four-sides model&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''four-sides model''' (also known as '''communication square''' or '''four-ears model''') is a [[communication model]] by [[Friedemann Schulz von Thun]]. According to this model every message has four facets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schulz-von-thun.de/index.php?article_id=71 4-sides model as per website of the (commercially operating) Schulz von Thun Institute for Communication (content in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; though not the same emphasis might be put on each. The four sides of the message are fact, self-revealing, relationship, and appeal.

== Relationship ==
The communication square describes the multi-layered structure of human utterances. It combines the idea of a postulate (second axiom) from [[Paul Watzlawick]], that every message contains content and relational facets, with the three sides of the [[Organon model]] by [[Karl Bühler]], that every message might reveal something about the sender, the receiver, and the request at hand. Such models are familiar in the linguistic community as part of [[speech act]] theory.

== The four sides of communication ==
* The ''Factual Level'' contains statements which are matter of fact like data and facts, which are part of the news.
* In the ''[[I-message|self-revealing]]'' or [[self-disclosure]] the speaker - conscious or not intended - tells something about himself, his motives, values, emotions etc.
* In the ''[[Social relationship|Relationship]]-layer'' is expressed resp. received {{Clarify|date=October 2018}}, how the sender gets along with the receiver and what she thinks of her.
* The ''[[Appeal (communication)|Appeal]]'' contains the desire, advice, instruction and effects that the speaker is seeking.

Every layer can be misunderstood individually.
The classic example of Schulz von Thun is the front-seat passenger who tells the driver: "Hey, the traffic lights are green". The driver will understand something different, depending on the ear with which he will hear, and will react differently. (On the matter layer he will understand the '''"fact"''' "''the traffic lights are green''", he could also understand it as "''Come on, drive''! ."-'''"command"''', or on the '''"relationship"''' could hear a help like "''I want to help you'', or if he hears behind it: ''I am in a hurry'' the passenger reveals part of himself "'''self-revelatory'''".") The emphasis on the four layers can be meant differently and also be understood differently. So the sender can stress the appeal of the statement and the receiver can mainly receive the relationship part of the message. This is one of the main reasons for misunderstandings.

=== The Factual Level ===
What I inform about:

On the '''factual level''' the sender of the news gives data, facts and statements. It is the task of the sender to send this information clearly and understandably.

The receiver proves with the  '''Factual ear''', whether the matter message fulfills the criteria of truth (true/untrue) or relevance (relevant/irrelevant) and the completeness (satisfying/something has to be added).

In a long-term team, the matter layer is clear and needs only a few words.

=== The self-revealing ===
What I reveal about myself:

In every news there is information about the sender.
On the layer of the '''self-revealing''' or [[self-disclosure]] the sender reveals himself. This message consists of conscious intended self-expression as well as unintended self-revealing, which is not conscious to the sender (see also [[Johari window]]). Thus, every news becomes information about the personality of the sender.

The '''self-revealing ear''' of the receiver perceives which information about the sender is hidden in the message.

=== The relationship indicator ===
What I think about you (you-statement) and how we get along (we-statement):

The '''relationship layer''' expresses how the sender gets along with the receiver and what he thinks about him. Depending on how he talks to him (way of formulation, body language, intonation ...) he expresses esteem, respect, friendliness, disinterest, contempt or something else.

Depending on which message the receiver hears with '''relationship ear''', he feels either depressed, accepted or patronized. A good communication is distinguished by communication from mutual appreciation.

=== The appeal ===
What I want to make you do:

Who states something, will also affect something. This '''appeal-message''' should make the receiver do something or leave something undone.  The attempt to influence someone can be less or more open (advice) or hidden (manipulation).

On the  '''Appeal ear''' the receiver asks himself: "What should I do, think or feel now?"

citation: " Mothers are very appeal-influenced by children."
Mum! The shoes .... Yes! I'll be right there to put them on for you.

== Example ==
Two people are eating a home-cooked meal together.

The one who didn't cook says: "There is something green in the soup."
; Sender
:{|
| Factual Level: || ''There is something green.''
|-
| Self-revealing layer: || ''I don't know what it is.''
|-
| Relationship layer: || ''You should know what it is.''
|-
| Appeal layer: || ''Tell me what it is!''
|}

; Receiver
:{|
| Matter layer: || ''There is something green.''
|-
| Self-revealing layer: || ''You do not know what the green item is, and that makes you feel uncomfortable.''
|-
| Relationship layer: || ''You think my cooking is questionable.''
|-
| Appeal layer: || ''I should only cook what you know in the future!''
|}

The other answers: "If you don't like the taste, you can cook it yourself."

Men and women use [[social network service]]s (SNSs) differently and with different frequencies.  In general, several researchers have found that women tend to use SNSs more than men and for different and more social purposes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Historical connections==
Technologies, including communications technologies, have a long history of shaping and being shaped by the gender of their users. Although technologies used to perform housework have an apparent historical connection to gender in many cultures,&lt;ref name=MacKenzie_and_Wajcman&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald |last1=MacKenzie |first2=Judy |last2=Wajcman |title= The Social Shaping of Technology: How the Refrigerator Got its Hum |year=1985 |publisher=Open University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more ready connection to SNSs may be drawn with [[telephone]]s as a communications technology readily and widely available in the home. Telephone use has long had gendered connections ranging from the widespread assumption that women simply talk more than men, and the employment of women as [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. In particular, young women have been closely associated with extensive and trivial use of the telephone for purely social purposes.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Fischer |title=America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940 |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kearney&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. C. Kearney |year=2005 |title=Birds on the Wire |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=568–601 |doi=10.1080/09502380500365499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, women's use of and influence on the development of computers has been trivialized&lt;ref name=Light&gt;{{cite journal |author=Light, J. |year=1999 |title=When Computers were Women |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=455–83 |doi=10.1353/tech.1999.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt; while significant developments in computers have been masculinized.&lt;ref name=Jonsson&gt;{{cite book |first=F. |last=Jonsson |year=2007 |chapter=The Absence of Hackerettes in the Culture of Programming | editor1-first=M. S. |editor1-last=Elm |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Sundén |title=Cyberfeminism in Northern Lights: Digital Media and Gender in a Nordic Context |pages=243–264 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the idea that there may be both real and perceived differences in how men and women use SNSs – and that those uses may shape the SNSs – is neither new nor surprising and has historical analogues.

There is historical and contemporary evidence that current fears about young girls' online safety have historical antecedents such as [[telegraph]]s and telephones. Further, in many cases those historical reactions resulted in restrictions of girls' use of technology to protect them from predators, molesters, and other criminals threatening their innocence. Like current fears focused on computer use, particularly SNSs and other communication media, these fears are most intense when the medium enters the home. These fears have the potential to – at least temporarily – overwhelm the positive and empowering uses of these technologies.&lt;ref name=Cassel_and_Cramer&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Cassel |first1=J. |last2=Cramer |first2=M. |editor-first=T. |editor-last=McPherson |title=Digital Youth, Innovation, and the Unexpected |publisher=MIT Press |year=2008 |pages=53–75 |chapter=High tech or high risk: Moral panics about girls online}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These historical fears are echoed in contemporary media accounts of youths' use of SNSs.

Finally, the histories of some SNSs themselves have ties with gender. For example, [[gay men]] were one of the earliest groups to join and use the early SNS [[Friendster]].&lt;ref name=boyd_and_Ellison&gt;{{cite journal |first1=danah |last1=boyd |first2=Nicole |last2=Ellison |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gap in gender differences has become less apparent in LinkedIn. In 2015 about 26 percent of online men and 25% of online women used the business-and employee-oriented networking site.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who have examined the gender of users of multiple SNSs have found contradictory results. Hargittai's groundbreaking 2007 study examining race, gender, and other differences between undergraduate college student users of SNSs found that women were not only more likely to have used SNSes than men but that they were also more likely to have used many different services, including Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster; these differences persisted in several models and analyses. Although she only surveyed students at one institution – the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] – Hargittai selected that institution intentionally as "an ideal location for studies of how different kinds of people use online sites and services."&lt;ref name=Hargittai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargittai, E. |year=2007 |title=Whose space? Differences among users and non-users of social network sites |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/hargittai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, data collected by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] found that men were more likely to have multiple SNS profiles. Although the sample sizes of the two surveys are comparable – 1,650 Internet users in the Pew survey&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; compared with 1,060 in Hargittai's survey&lt;ref name=Hargittai /&gt; – the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population.&lt;ref name=Pew_methodology&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Information |author=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200237/http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram attract more females. Picture sharing sites overall are very popular among women. Pinterest alone attracts three times as many female users than male. Although use of Pinterest by men has increased from 5% in 2012. Facebook attracts about 77% of women online. Instagram is also more likely to attract women. Men are more likely to participate in online forums like Reddit, Digg or Slashdot. One in five men claim to be a part of an online forum.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt;

===Uses===

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection and posting of photographs.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt; Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., &amp; Smith, A. (2007). Teens and social media. Washington, DC: Pew Internet and American Life Project. Retrieved February 27, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-andSocial-Media.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a study of [[blog]]s maintained in MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs.&lt;ref name=Jones_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Jones, S., Millermaier, S., Goya-Martinez, M., &amp; Schuler, J. |year=2008 |title=Whose space is MySpace? A content analysis of MySpace profiles |journal=First Monday |volume=13 |issue=9 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2202/2024 |doi=10.5210/fm.v13i9.2202}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Sweden|Swedish]] SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express [[heterosexual]] behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.&lt;ref name=Sveningsson&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Sveningsson Elm, M. |year=2007 |title=Gender stereotypes and young people's presentations of relationships in a Swedish Internet community |journal=YOUNG |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=145–167 |doi=10.1177/110330880701500203}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale study of gender differences in MySpace found that both men and women tended to have a majority of female Friends, and both men and women tended to have a majority of female "Top" Friends in the site.&lt;ref name=Thelwall1&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2008 |title= Social networks, gender and friending: An analysis of MySpace member profiles |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=1321–1330 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpace_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20835}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A later study found women to author disproportionately many (public) comments in MySpace,&lt;ref name=Thelwall2&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2009 |title= Homophily in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=219–231 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpaceHomophilypreprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20978}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
but an investigation into the role of emotion in public MySpace comments found that women both give and receive stronger positive emotion.&lt;ref name=Thelwall3&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M., Wilkinson, D., Uppal, S. |year=2010 |title=Data mining emotion in social network communication: Gender differences in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=190–199 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/DataMiningEmotionSNS_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.21180}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesised that women are simply more effective at using [[social networking sites]] because they are better able to harness positive emotion.

A study focused on the influence of gender and personality on individuals’ use of online social networking websites such as Facebook, reported that men use social networking sites with the intention of forming new relationships, whereas, women use them more for relationship maintenance. (Muscanell and Guadagno, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Muscanell N.L., Guadagno R.E. | year = 2012 | title = Make new friends or keep the old: Gender and personality differences in social networking use | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 107–112 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to this, women are more likely to use Facebook or MySpace to compare themselves to others and also to search for information. Men, however, are more likely to look at other people's profiles with in the intention to find friends. (Haferkamp et al., 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haferkamp N., Eimler S.C., Papadakis A.M., Kruck J.V. | year = 2012 | title = Men are from Mars, women are from Venus? Examining gender differences in self-presentation on social networking sites | url = | journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 91–98 | doi=10.1089/cyber.2011.0151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===

[[Internet privacy|Privacy]] has been the primary topic of many studies of SNS users, and many of these studies have found differences between male and female SNS users, although some studies have found results contradictory to those found in other studies.

Some researchers have found that women are more protective of their personal information and more likely to have private profiles.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Lewis, K., Kaufman, J., &amp; Christakis, N. |year=2008 |title=The taste for privacy: An analysis of college student privacy settings in an online social network |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=79–100 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01432.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that women are less likely to post some types of information. Acquisti and Gross found that women in their sample were less likely to reveal their [[sexual orientation]], personal address, or cell phone number.&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt; This is similar to Pew Internet &amp; American Life research of children users of SNSs that found that boys and girls presented different views of privacy and behaviors, with girls being more concerned about and restrictive of information such as city, town, last name, and cell phone number that could be used to locate them.&lt;ref name=Lenhart_and_Madden&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenhart, A., &amp; Madden, M. |year=2007 |title=Teens, privacy &amp; online social networks |publisher=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219174827/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At least one group of researchers has found that women are less likely to share information that "identifies them directly – last name, cell phone number, and address or home phone number," linking that resistance to women's greater concerns about "[[cyberstalking]]", "[[cyberbullying]]", and security problems.&lt;ref name=Salaway_and_Caruso /&gt;

Despite these concerns about privacy, researchers have found that women are more likely to maintain up-to-date photos of themselves.&lt;ref name=Kolek&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Kolek, E. A., &amp; Saunders, D. |title=Online disclosure: An empirical examination of undergraduate Facebook profiles |journal=NASPA Journal |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2008 |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1905}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strano&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Strano, M. M. |year=2008 |title=User descriptions and interpretations of self-presentation through Facebook profile images |journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |volume=2 |issue=2 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008110402&amp;article=(search%20in%20Issues)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kolek and Saunders found in their sample of college student Facebook users that women were more likely to not only post a photograph of themselves in their profile but that they were more likely to have a publicly viewable Facebook account (a contradictory finding compared to many other studies), post photos, and post photo albums.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt;

Women were more likely to have: (a) a publicly viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) a photo of themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, women were more likely to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt; Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study were more likely to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving. Citing several examples, Strano opined that there may also be a difference in how men and women Facebook users display and interpret profile photos depicting relationships.&lt;ref name=Strano /&gt;

Privacy has also been a concern for the SnapChat app, which allows you to send messages either text or photo or video which then disappear. One study has shown that security is not a major concern for the majority of users and that most do not use Snapchat to send sensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally). As part of their research almost no statistically significant gender differences were found.&lt;ref&gt;Roesner, F., Gill, B. T., &amp; Kohno, T. (2014). Sex, Lies, Or kittens? investigating the use of snapchat’s self-destructing messages. In ''Financial Cryptography and Data Security - 18th International Conference, FC 2014, Revised Selected Papers.'' (Vol. 8437, pp. 64-76). (Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics); Vol. 8437). Springer Verlag. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberbullying'''

Past research carried out to investigate if there are any gender differences in cyber-bulling has found that boys commit more cyber verbal bullying, cyber forgery and more violence based on hidden identity or presenting themselves as other person. (Sincek 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Šincek, D., 2014, January. Gender differences in cyber-bullying. In International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ARTS SGEM2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
Although men and women users of SNSs exhibit different behavior and motivations, they share some similarities. For example, one study that examined the veracity of information shared on SNSs by college students found that men and women were as likely to "provide accurate and complete information about their birthday, schedule of classes, partner's name, AIM, or political views."&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt;

In contradiction to several of the studies described above that found that women are more likely to be SNS users, at least one very reputable study has found that men and women are equally likely to be SNS users. Data gathered in December 2008 by the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] showed that the SNS users in their sample were equally divided among men and women.&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; As mentioned above, the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population&lt;ref name="Pew_methodology" /&gt; than the data in much of the previously described research.

==Traditional gender roles==
Some studies have found that traditional gender roles are present in SNSs, with men in this study conforming to traditional views of [[masculinity]] and the women to traditional views of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman /&gt; Qualitative work with college student SNS users by Martínez Alemán and Wartman&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Martínez Alemán |first1=A. M. |last2=Wartman |first2=K. L. |year=2009 |title=Online social networking on campus: Understanding what matters in student culture |publisher=Routledge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Managgo ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Manago, A. M., Graham, M. B., Greenfield, P. M., &amp; Salimkhan, G. |year=2008 |title=Self-presentation and gender on MySpace |journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology |volume=29 |pages=446–458 |doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.001 |issue=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; have found similar results for both Facebook and MySpace users. Moreover, the work by Managgo ''et al.'' discovered not only traditional gender roles and images but sexualisation of women users of MySpace.&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al /&gt; Similarly, research into the impact of comments in the profile of a Facebook users on that user's perceived attractiveness revealed a "sexual double standard", wherein negative statements resulted in male profile owners being judged more attractive and female profile owners less attractive.&lt;ref name=Walther_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x |author=Walther, J. B., Van Der Heide, B., Kim, S., Westerman, D., &amp; Tong, S. T. |year=2008 |title=The role of friends' appearance and behavior on evaluations of individuals on Facebook: Are we known by the company we keep? |journal=Human Communication Research |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=28–49 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119404132/abstract}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at least one study has found that men and women SNS users both left textual clues about their gender.&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;

==Other gender identities in social networking==
In February 2014, Facebook announced the vast expansion of options for choosing gender identities to list on profiles, ranging to up to 56 gender identity choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apnewsbreak-gender-options-facebook-users-22501422|title=Technology and Science News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=567587973337709|title=Timeline Photos - Facebook Diversity - Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Facebook followed up with allowing gender-neutral relationship identities for identifying family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/08/28/facebook-adds-gender-neutral-family-relationship-settings|title=Facebook Adds Gender-Neutral Family Relationship Settings|author=[[Parker Marie Molloy]]|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations''' at [[Harvard University]] seeks to expand understanding and accelerate critical thinking about civil society among scholars, practitioners, policy makers and the general public, by encouraging scholarship, developing curriculum, fostering mutual learning between academics and practitioners, and shaping policies that enhance the sector and its role in society. The Hauser Center was established by [[Rita Hauser]] and her husband Gustave M. Hauser in 1997. 

Located at the [[Harvard Kennedy School of Government]], the Center's concerns include [[philanthropy]], [[nonprofit organizations]], [[voluntarism (action)|voluntarism,]] and [[civil society]]. The Center provides an intellectual home for faculty, research fellows, visiting scholars, and students across the university who share interests in these topics. 
The Center hosts several regular seminars during the academic year on topics of interest to the nonprofit community as well as those that are part of the Center’s research projects. It hosts special events beyond Harvard, such as the NGO Leaders Forum, a semi-annual retreat for chief executives of major U.S.-based international relief and development NGOs. It also brings leaders of nonprofit institutions to Harvard, such as its senior research fellows Jim Bildner, L. David Brown, Steven Lawry, Peter Bell, Jennifer McCrea, and Marion Fremont-Smith.

==Programs and Projects==

The Hauser Center’s programs and projects engage scholars and practitioners interested in the nonprofit field on a variety of topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19679">{{Slavery}}[[History of slavery|Like slavery]], '''[[serfdom]] has a long history''', dating to the [[Ancient Times]].

==Origins==
Social institutions similar to serfdom occurred in the ancient world. The status of the [[helots]] in the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]] resembled that of medieval serfs.  By the 3rd century AD, the [[Roman Empire]] faced a labour shortage.  Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen, acting as tenant farmers, (instead of on slaves) to provide labour.&lt;ref name="Mackay298"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mackay |first= Christopher |title= Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2004 |page= 298 |isbn= 0521809185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The status of these tenant farmers, eventually known as [[colonus (person)|coloni]], steadily eroded.   Because the tax system implemented by [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284-305)  assessed taxes based both on land and on the inhabitants of that land, it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where the census counted them.&lt;ref name="Mackay298" /&gt; In 332 AD [[Emperor Constantine]] issued legislation that greatly restricted the rights of the coloni and tied them to the land.  Some{{quantify|date=December 2016}} see these laws as the beginning of medieval serfdom in Europe.

However, medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} around the 10th century. The demise of this empire, which had ruled much of western Europe for more than 200 years, ushered in a long period during which no strong central government existed in most of Europe. During this period, powerful [[feudalism|feudal lords]] encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural [[labour (economics)|labor]]. Serfdom, indeed, was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords ensured that others worked to feed them and were held down, legally and economically, while doing so.

== Heyday ==
Serfdom as a system provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Slavery]] persisted right through the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24160 Ways of ending slavery]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was rare, diminishing and largely confined to the use of household slaves.  Parts of Europe, including much of [[Scandinavia]], never adopted serfdom.{{why|date=December 2016}}

In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the [[Rhine]] even as it spread through much of the rest of Europe. This was one important cause for the deep differences{{which?|date=December 2016}} between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe{{where|date=April 2015}}. In [[Western Europe]], the rise of powerful monarchs, towns, and an improving economy weakened the [[manorial system]] through the 13th and 14th centuries; serfdom had become rare by 1400. 

Serfdom in Western Europe came largely to an end in the 15th and 16th centuries, because of changes in the economy, population, and laws governing lord-tenant relations in Western European nations. The enclosure of manor fields for livestock grazing and for larger arable plots made the economy of serfs' small strips of land in open fields less attractive to landowners. Furthermore, the increasing use of money made tenant farming by serfs less profitable; for much less than it cost to support a serf, a lord could now hire workers who were more skilled and pay them in cash. Paid labour was also more flexible, since workers could be hired only when they were needed.

At the same time, increasing unrest and uprisings by serfs and peasants, like [[Peasants' Revolt|Tyler’s Rebellion]] in England in 1381, put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to reform the system. As a result, the gradual establishment of new forms of land leases and increased personal liberties accommodated serf and peasant demands to some extent.

An important factor in the decline of serfdom was industrial development—especially the [[Industrial Revolution]]. With the growing profitability of [[industry]], farmers wanted to move to towns to receive higher wages than those they could earn working in the fields,{{cn|date=December 2016}} while landowners also invested in the more profitable industry. This also led to the growing process of [[urbanization]].{{Multiple image

Serfdom reached [[Eastern Europe]] centuries later than Western Europe—it became dominant around the 15th century. Before that time, Eastern Europe had been much more sparsely populated than Western Europe, and the lords of Eastern Europe created a peasantry-friendly environment to encourage migration east.{{cn|date=December 2016}}  Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the [[Black Death]] epidemics of the mid-14th century, which stopped the eastward migration.  The resulting high land-to-labour ratio - combined with Eastern Europe's vast, sparsely populated areas - gave the lords an incentive to bind the remaining peasantry to their land. With increased demand for agricultural produce in Western Europe during the later era when Western Europe limited and eventually abolished serfdom, serfdom remained in force throughout Eastern Europe during the 17th century so that nobility-owned estates could produce more agricultural products (especially [[cereal|grain]]) for the profitable export market.

This pattern applied in Central and Eastern European countries, including [[Prussia]] ([[Prussian Ordinances]] of 1525), [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] (laws of the late 15th and early 16th centuries), the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[szlachta]] privileges of the early 16th century) and the [[Russian Empire]] (laws of the late 16th and first half of the 17th century). This also led to the slower industrial development and urbanisation of those regions.  Generally, this process, referred to{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} as "second serfdom" or "export-led serfdom", persisted until the mid-19th century and became very repressive and substantially limited serfs' rights. Before the 1861 abolition of serfdom in Russia, a landowner's estate was often measured by the number of "souls" he owned, a practice made famous by Gogol's 1842 novel ''[[Dead Souls]]''.

Many of these countries abolished serfdom during the [[Napoleonic wars|Napoleonic invasions]] of the early 19th century. Serfdom remained in force in most of Russia until the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]], enacted on February 19, 1861, though in the Russian-controlled [[Governorate of Livonia|Baltic provinces]] it had been abolished at the beginning of the 19th century. According to the Russian census of 1857, [[Russian serfdom|Russia had 23.1 million private serfs]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Russian serfdom]] was perhaps the most notable Eastern European institution, as it was never influenced by German law and migrations,{{cn|date=December 2016}} and serfdom and the [[manorialism|manorial]] system were enforced by the crown ([[Tsar]]), not by the nobility.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Decline==

In Western Europe serfdom became progressively less common through the Middle Ages, particularly after the [[Black Death]] reduced the rural population and increased the bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, the lords of many manors were willing (for payment) to ''manumit'' ("release") their serfs.

In [[Normandy]], serfdom had disappeared by 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Sept essais sur des Aspects de la société et de l'économie dans la Normandie médiévale (Xe-XIIIe siècles) 
Lucien Musset, Jean-Michel Bouvris, Véronique Gazea, Cahier des Annales de Normandie 1988, Volume 22, Issue   22, pp. 3-140&lt;/ref&gt; Two possible causes of the disappearance of serfdom in Normandy have been proposed: (1) it might have been implemented to attract peasants to a Normandy depopulated by the Viking invasions or (2) it might be a result of the peasants' revolt of 996 in Normandy.

In [[England]], the end of serfdom began with the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381. It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status and was fully ended when [[Elizabeth I]] freed the last remaining serfs in 1574.&lt;ref name="1902encyclopedia" /&gt; Land held by serf tenure (unless enfranchised) continued to be held by what was thenceforth known as a [[copyhold|copyhold tenancy]], which was not completely abolished until 1925 (although it was whittled away during the 19th and early 20th centuries). There were native-born [[Scotland|Scottish]] serfs until 1799, when coal miners who were kept in serfdom gained [[emancipation]]. However, most Scottish serfs had already been freed.

Serfdom was ''de facto'' ended in France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] (1315), and [[Philip V of France|Philip V]] (1318).&lt;ref name="1902encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/S/SLA/slavery-12.html 1902encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Druon, Le Roi de fer, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of a few isolated cases, serfdom had ceased to exist in France by the 15th century. In Early Modern France, [[French nobility|French nobles]] nevertheless maintained a great number of [[Manorialism|seigneurial privileges]] over the [[Freehold (law)|free]] peasants that worked lands under their control. Serfdom was formally abolished in [[France]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Serfdom Serfdom LoveToKnow 1911] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527113728/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Serfdom |date=2013-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other parts of Europe, there had been [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe|peasant revolts]] in Castille, Germany, northern France, Portugal, and Sweden. Although they were often successful, it usually took a long time before legal systems were changed.

===Era of the French Revolution===
The era of the [[French Revolution]] (1790s to 1820s) saw serfdom abolished in most of Western Europe, while its practice remained common in Eastern Europe for another century or more. In France, serfdom had been in decline for at least three centuries by the start of the Revolution, replaced by various forms of freehold tenancy. The last vestiges of serfdom were officially ended on August 4, 1789 with a decree abolishing the feudal rights of the nobility.

It removed the authority of the manorial courts, eliminated tithes and manorial dues, and freed those who still remained bound to the land. However, the decree was mostly symbolic, as widespread peasant revolts had effectively ended the feudal system beforehand; and ownership of the land still remained in the hands of the landlords, who could continue collecting rents and enforcing tenant contracts.

[[Image:Freilassungsbrief Weymann.jpg|thumb|200px|End of serfdom: a German „Freilassungsbrief“ (Letter for the End of a serfdom) from 1762.]]

In [[History of Germany|German history]] the emancipation of the serfs came in 1770-1830, beginning with [[Schleswig]] in 1780. [[Prussia]] abolished serfdom with the "[[October Edict]]" of 1807, which upgraded the personal legal status of the peasantry and gave them ownership of half or two-thirds of the lands they were working. The edict applied to all peasants whose holdings were above a certain size, and included both Crown lands and noble estates. The peasants were freed from the obligation of personal services to the lord and annual dues; in return landowners were given ownership of 1/3 to 1/2 of the land. The peasant owned and rented the lands that were deeded to the old owners. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815.&lt;ref name="Ewa Sagarra pp 341-45"&gt;Ewa Sagarra, ''A social history of Germany,'' pp 341-45&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by [[the Enlightenment]], played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. The old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century. What was new was that the peasant could now sell his land, enabling him to move to the city, or buy up the land of his neighbors.&lt;ref name="Ewa Sagarra pp 341-45"/&gt;

The land reforms in northwestern Germany were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished feudal obligations and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy. It produced increased productivity and population growth. It strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile, the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stefan |last=Brakensiek |title=Agrarian Individualism in North-Western Germany, 1770-1870 |journal=German History |year=1994 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=137–179 |doi=10.1093/gh/12.2.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; East of the [[Elbe River]], the [[Junker|Junker class]] maintained large estates and monopolized political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. A. |last=Perkins |title=Dualism in German Agrarian Historiography |journal=[[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |year=1986 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=287–330 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500013876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eradication of the feudal system marks the beginning of an era of rapid change in Europe. The change in status following the [[enclosure movement]]s beginning in the later 18th century, in which various lords abandoned the open field farming of previous centuries and, essentially, took all the best land for themselves in exchange for "freeing" their serfs, may well have made serfdom seem more desirable to many peasant families.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', in Chapter 26 entitled "The Secret of Primitive Accumulation" and Chapter 27, "Expropriation of the Agricultural Population from the Land", [[Karl Marx|Marx]] claimed that the feudal relationships of serfdom were violently transformed into private property and free labour: free of possession and free to sell their labour force on the market. Being liberated from serfdom meant being able to sell one's land and work wherever one desired. "The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the pre-historic stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it."

In a case history of England, Marx described how the serfs became free peasant proprietors and small farmers, who were, over time, forcibly expropriated and driven off the land, forming a property-less [[proletariat]]. He also claimed that more and more legislation was enacted by the state to control and regiment this new class of [[wage labour|wage workers]]. In the meantime, the remaining farmers became capitalist farmers operating more and more on a commercial basis; and gradually, legal monopolies preventing trade and investment by [[entrepreneur]]s were broken up.

Taxes levied by the state took the place of labour dues levied by the lord. Although serfdom began its decline in Europe in the Middle Ages, it took many hundreds of years to disappear completely. In addition, the struggles of the working class during the Industrial Revolution can often be compared with the struggles of the serfs during the Middle Ages. In parts of the world today, [[unfree labour|forced labour]] is still used. [[Image:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|300px|right|"[[Galician slaughter]]" 1846, by [[Jan Lewicki]] (1795-1871); "directed against manorial property (for example, the manorial prisons) and rising against serfdom;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change, Routledge, 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-16111-8}}. p. 295 – 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Galician, mainly Polish, peasants killed over 1000 noblemen and destroyed 500 manors in 1846."]]

===Russia===
{{main|Serfdom in Russia| Emancipation Reform of 1861}}
Serfdom became the dominant form of relation between Russian peasants and nobility in the 17th century. Serfdom only existed in central and southern areas of the Russian Empire. It was never established in the North, in the Urals, nor in Siberia. Historian David Moon argues that serfdom was a response to military and economic factors in Russia. It was socially stable and adaptable to changing demographic and economic conditions; revolts were uncommon. Moon says it was not the cause of Russia's backwardness; instead, backwardness blocked alternative methods that were developed in Western Europe. Moon identifies some benefits for serfs, such as assurances of land and some assistance after bad harvests. Moon argues that Russia's defeat in the Crimean War was a catalyst leading to the abolition of serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;David Moon, "Reassessing Russian serfdom," ''European History Quarterly'' (1996) 26#4 pp 483-526&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Moon, ''The Russian peasantry 1600-1930: the world the peasants made'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, serfdom was abolished by a decree issued by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1861. Scholars have proposed multiple overlapping reasons to account for the abolition, including fear of a large-scale revolt by the serfs, the financial needs of the government, evolving cultural sensibilities, the military need for soldiers, and, among Marxists, the unprofitability of serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Evsey D. Domar, and Mark J. Machina, "On the profitability of Russian serfdom." ''Journal of Economic History'' (1984) 44#4 pp: 919-955.

'''Humanistic Informatics''' (also known as '''Humanities informatics''') is one of several names chosen for the study of the relationship between [[human culture]] and [[technology]]. The term is fairly common in [[Europe]], but is little known in the [[English-speaking world]], though [[Digital Humanities]] (also known as '''Humanities computing''') is in many cases roughly equivalent. 

Humanistic informatics departments were generally started in the 1990s when universities rarely taught humanities-based approaches to the rapidly developing computerized society. For this reason, the field was quite broadly defined, and included courses in humanities computing, basic introductions to how computers work, historical developments of technology, technology and learning, digital art and literature and digital culture. Today several departments have declared more specialized areas of research, such as digital arts and culture at the [[University of Bergen]], and socio-cultural communication with and without technology at the [[University of Aalborg]].

Digital Humanities is a primary topic, and there are several universities in the US and the UK that have Digital Arts and Humanities research and development centers. One aspect of Digital Humanities that will grow will be the intersection of new digital media and the humanities, particularly in the gaming industry which has developed both casual and serious gaming and game design strategies to foster learning in the humanities and all other academic disciplines. A key principle in all digital interactive media or games is the storyline; the narrative or quest or goal of the game is primary to both literary works and games. Characters and players go on the quest, and playing the game becomes the narrative.  Game design principles, also relevant in literature and the fine arts, include visual literacy and empowering players/learners to align with great artitsts and writers who believe in the creative process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7645">[[File:Pigeon-hole messagebox 3.jpg|thumb|Pigeon-hole messageboxes at Stanford University, California, USA]]
In a large organisation with many employees, there is frequently an '''internal mail''' system. The '''post room''' sorts the incoming mail and the 'mailboy' takes it around on a trolly to the various [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] and direct to the desks of important people.

==Mailroom==
{{main|Mailroom}}

This is the name of the department or the room where mail is sorted internally within a large organisation. '''Mailroom''' is used primarily by US companies and '''Post room''' by UK companies and organisations (e.g. hospitals and universities.)

==Central distribution==
This is where goods as opposed to letters are delivered to and distributed from.  Small packets and letters in bulk (e.g. mailsacks) would be sent on to the mailroom.  Goods are often heavy and bulky and may require specialist handling (e.g. fragile), [[lifting equipment]] (forklifts for pallets) and transportation devices (sacktrucks, motorised trollies, vans and flatbeds) and are therefore rarely handled by the mailroom.&lt;ref name="surrey.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=1638,1480713&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Central Distribution|author=|work=surrey.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal mail==
This is the name for mail which is sent and received between employees and departments.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.pws.gov.nt.ca/regionalServices/mailSystems.htm Internal and External Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;  Internal mail will often use a special envelope which can be reused.  It is common for them to have many address boxes that are used in order.  The most recent box is the current delivery address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.office365.co.uk/P/A26310/New-Guardian-Internal-Mail-Envelopes-Pocket-Tuck-in-Flap-125gsm-Manilla-C4-Pack-250|title=New Guardian Internal Mail Envelopes Pocket Tuck-in Flap 125gsm Manilla C4 [Pack 250]|work=office365.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# An employee with a desk places mail in their out tray.
# An employee without a desk places mail in the pigeonhole for the recipient of the mail or the one marked internal mail.
# The mailboy collects mail from the out tray of every desk and also the internal mail pigeonhole of every department
# The mailboy sorts the mail by department using the wallets on his trolley
# The mailboy visits every department
# The mail is placed in the in tray of the intended employee or in their pigeonhole

==External mail==
This is the name used to describe mail which comes from or is going to another organisation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Outgoing mail===
# An employee with a desk places mail in their out tray or in the pigeonhole marked external mail.
# The mailboy collects the mail from the out tray and collects mail from the departmental pigeonholes marked external mail
# The mailboy places external mail in the external mail wallet on his trolly.
# The mailboy visits the mail room
# External mail is passed to the postmaster or another mail clerk
# The mail is weighed, stamped, franked etc. and is collected by the national mail service

===Incoming mail===

# The national mail service deliver the mail once or more per day.
# The postmaster or a mail clerk sorts the mail by department.
# The mailboy collects the mail from the mailroom and places it in the appropriate departmental wallet on his trolley.
# The mailboy visits every department.
# The mail is delivered to the employee's desk or their pigeonhole.

==Pigeon-hole==
{{main|Pigeon-hole messagebox}}

This is the departmental system of mail delivery for employees that don't have a desk.

==Letter trays==
This is where mail is delivered to or received from when an employee has a desk.  Each desk has a minimum of three letter trays labelled, in, out and pending. The in tray is where mail is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/in-tray|title=in-tray definition - English dictionary for learners - Reverso|work=reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The out tray is mail that is waiting to be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/out-tray|title=out-tray definition - English dictionary for learners - Reverso|work=reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pending tray is for documents that cannot be worked on at present because input from another person is required, or the requests are low priority. Sometimes additional trays are used for post, filing, dictation, etc. according to the needs of the individual or organisation.
==Postmaster==
{{main|Postmaster}}
This person usually works independently and is responsible for a company's incoming and outgoing mail. They are in charge of the mailroom and all of the employees that work there.

==Mailroom clerk==
A person who works in a mailroom is known as a '''mailroom clerk''', '''mailroom operator''' or '''post room operator'''. A mailroom clerk deals with the preparation of packaged goods, letters, and other mail for shipping by the local post office or by an independent shipping service. A mailroom clerk's job may be with a [[private firm]], [[government agency]], [[non-profit group]], or a [[military operation]].  In some small companies, the pigeonholes are in the reception area so the receptionist may take on this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totaljobs.com|title=UK jobs - Job search on totaljobs.com - Find jobs, build a career|work=totaljobs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mailboy==
'''Mailboy''' is the traditional name for the '''mailroom clerk''' who collects and delivers mail within a large organisation.  A 'mailboy', delivers mail for other employees in different departments using a mail cart or a trolley often sorting as he goes using the pouches or wallets that are part of the trolley.  It is typically the most junior of roles and many employees start here so they can get a feel for the entire organisation, get to know everyone rapidly, and then to decide where in an organisation they would like to train for and work within.  In the modern workplace it is a role suitable for people with learning difficulties and helps an organisation meet legislative quotas.  A trolly with many slots is frequently used so that sorting can take place while the trolly does its rounds thereby reducing the amount of mail that has to be sorted in the mailroom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internal-mail-tracking.com/Track%20mail%20trolley%20deliveries.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923014650/http://www.internal-mail-tracking.com/Track%20mail%20trolley%20deliveries.html |date=September 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bring Me the Head of Willy the Mailboy!]] is the title of a [[Dilbert]] book and contains a great deal of humour about modern office life through the eyes of a computer engineer.

==Automated systems==
Some companies use an automated system to assist with mail.  Tracks which loop around the building carry the mail between the mailroom and the departmental mailrooms or reception areas  The mail and small packets are placed on "trucks" or "trollies" which are programmed with the destination &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanswerbank.co.uk/Technology/Question416522.html|title=HSBC internal mail system|work=theanswerbank.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoft.com/solutions/internal-mail-tracking.html|title=Internal Mail Tracking with barcodes - Britsoft Limited|author=Clive Holt|work=britsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet]] technologies are used for cause-related [[fundraising]], [[community building]], [[lobbying]], and [[organizing (management)|organizing]]. A digital activism campaign is "an
organized public effort, making collective claims on a target authority, in which civic initiators or supporters use digital media."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-activism.org/download/1270/ Edwards, Frank, Philip N.

== Types ==
Sandor Vegh divides online activism into three main categories: '''Awareness/advocacy''', '''organization/mobilization''', and '''action/reaction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KHCjMkNRAkYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;ots=NvYT6OGWNj&amp;sig=vT1cUU7btaEJh4kHpNpW459UzCs#v=onepage&amp;q=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;f=false|title=Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice|first1=Martha|last1=McCaughey|first2=Michael D.|last2=Ayers|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other ways of classifying types of online activism, such as by the degree of reliance on the Internet. Thus, Internet sleuthing or hacking could be viewed as purely online forms of activism, whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement was only partially online.

The Internet is a key resource for independent activists, or E-activists, particularly those whose message may run counter to the mainstream. "Especially when a serious violation of [[human rights]] occurs, the Internet is essential in reporting the atrocity to the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism: The Case of Cyberprotests Against the World Bank" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and PRACTICE,'' Eds. Ayers, Michael D., [[Martha McCaughey|Mccaughey, Martha]], pp. 72-73. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; [[Listserv]]s like BurmaNet and Freedom News Group help distribute news that would otherwise be inaccessible in these countries.

Internet activists also pass on E-petitions to be sent to the government and public and private organizations to protest against and urge for positive policy change in areas from the [[arms industry|arms trade]] to [[animal testing]]. Many non-profits and charities use these methods, emailing petitions to those on their email list and asking people to pass them on. The Internet also enables organizations such as [[NGO]]s to communicate with individuals in an inexpensive and timely manner. Gatherings and [[protest]]s can be organized with the input of the organizers and the participants. [[Lobbying]] is also made easier via the Internet, thanks to [[e-mail bomb|mass e-mail]] and its ability to broadcast a message widely at little cost. Vegh's concept of organization/mobilization, for example, can refer to activities taking place solely online, solely offline but organized online, or a combination of online and offline. Mainstream [[social networking websites|social-networking sites]], most noticeably [[Facebook.com]], are also making e-activist tools available to their users.  An active participatory culture is enabled by the communities on social networking sites because they permit communication between groups that are otherwise unable to communicate. In the article "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community," Nessim Watson stresses the necessity of communication in online communities. He even goes as far as to say that "Without ongoing communication among its participants, a community dissolves". The constant ability to communicate with members of the community enriches online community experiences and redefines the word community.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Nessim "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community" pp. 103-104. SAG Publications 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[denial-of-Service attack]]s, the taking over and vandalizing of a website, uploading [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], and sending out [[e-mail bomb]]s (mass e-mailings) are also examples of Internet activism. For more examples of these types of subversive action, see [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice,'' pp. 71-95. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hashtag activism===
{{Main article|Hashtag activism}}
Hashtag activism is the use of [[hashtag]]s for fighting or supporting a cause through the usage of social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29047/hashtag-activism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has been associated with the [[2014 Chibok kidnapping]], with hopes that it would help keep the story in the news and raise international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/michelle-obama-nigeria-presidential-address | title=Michelle Obama raises pressure over kidnapped schoolgirls | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag itself has received 2 million retweets.

One example of the powerful rise of hashtag activism can be seen in the black feminist movement's use of hashtags to convey their cause. The famous hashtag "IamJada" was an internet backlash to the mocking "#Jadapose" that went viral, ensuing after a sixteen-year-old girl Jada Smart was photographed following her gang rape &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digital Defense: Black Feminists Resist Violence With Hashtag Activism|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a hashtag was employed to convey a powerful anti-rape message.

== Development processes ==

Exploring the dynamics of online activism for expressing resistance to a powerful organization, a [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426 study] published in [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-organization/ Information and Organization] developed a critical mass approach to online activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi, S., Clegg, S.|title=‘these days will never be forgotten’: Critical Mass Approach to Online Activism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426|website=Information and Organization|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were integrated in a four-year longitudinal process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites’ reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. The process model suggests a complex interplay among stakeholders’ interests, opportunities for activism, costs and outcomes that are neither foreseen nor entirely predictable. The authors challenge universal access to the Internet as a convenient and cost-free forum for practicing social activism by organizational stakeholders (customers, employees, outside parties). In fact, the technology enablers of social activism also enable its filtering and repression and thus more extreme states of information asymmetry may result in which powerful elites preserve their status and impose a greater digital divide.

In one study, a discussion of a developmental model of political mobilization is discussed. By citizens joining groups and creating discussion, they are beginning their first stage of involvement. Progressively, it is hoped that they will begin signing petitions online and graduating to offline contact as long as the organization provides the citizen with escalating steps of involvement (Vitak et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Vitak, J., Zube, P., Smock, A., Carr, C. T., Ellison, N., &amp; Lampe, C. (2011). It's Complicated: Facebook Users' Political Participation in the 2008 Election. Cyberpsychology, Behavior &amp; Social Networking, 14(3), 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the mass media's centrality has been highly contested, with some people arguing that it promoted the voices of marginalized groups while others believe it sends forth the messages of the majority alone, leaving minority groups to have their voices robbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Apparently They Don’t Like Succinct and Articulate’: Journalists, Activists, and the Battle over News|journal=Soundbitten: The Perils of Media-Centered Political Activism|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of early activism ==
One of the earliest known uses of the Internet as a medium for activism was that around Lotus MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp91/culnan.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1990, [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] announced a [[direct mail marketing|direct-mail marketing]] [[database]] product that was to contain name, address, and spending habit information on 120 million individual U.S. citizens. While much of the same data was already available, privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data within one database. Furthermore, the data would be on [[CD-ROM]], and so would remain fixed until a new CD-ROM was issued.

In response, a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started, which included information on contacting [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] and [[form letter]]s. Larry Seiler, a [[New England]]-based computer professional, posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: "It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU, which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs. It seems to me (and to a lot of other people, too) that this will be a little too much like [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|big brother]], and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time."Over 30,000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database. On January 23, 1991, Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;Gurak, L.J. (1997). Persuasion and Privacy in Cyberspace: The Online Protests over Lotus MarketPlace and the Clipper Chip. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a survey article about online activism around the world, from [[Croatia]] to the [[United States]], appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, with several activists being quoted about their projects and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The earliest example of mass emailing as a rudimentary form of [[DDoS]] occurred on Guy Fawkes Day 1994, when the [[Intervasion of the UK]] began email-bombing John Major's cabinet and UK parliamentary servers in protest against the [[Criminal Justice Bill]], which outlawed outdoor rave festivals and "music with a repetitive beat"

In 1995–1998, Z magazine offered courses online through Left Online University, with lessons on "Using the Internet for Electronic Activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/pen-l@galaxy.csuchico.edu/msg06511.html |title=(PEN-L:700) USE the INTERNET to CHANGE THE WORLD: An Online Course for Activists |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=1995-10-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[cyber-dissidence]] and activism per se, that is, in its modern-day form, may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living in political exile in New Jersey in the United States. In 1998, he created a Website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org/ Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/ |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Globalwebco.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Bdpgabon.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyption revolutions, where the Internet has proven to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition, and revolution against dictators. In July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known-to-be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en |title=Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-08-12 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en |title=Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another well-known example of early Internet activism took place in 1998, when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] rebel group [[EZLN]] used decentralized communications, such as cell phones, to network with [[developed world]] activists and help create the [[anti-globalization]] group [[Peoples Global Action]] (PGA) to protest the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-bulletin.org/IBMEF_1_word%206%20files/pablo_rev.htm |title=A world of many worlds |publisher=Iran-bulletin.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PGA continued to call for "global days of action" and rally support of other anti-globalization groups in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/en/pgainfos/history.htm |title=www.agp.org – Brief history of PGA |publisher=Nadir.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a worldwide network of Internet activist sites, under the umbrella name of [[Indymedia]], was created "for the purpose of providing grassroots coverage of the WTO protests in [[Seattle]]" in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/static/about.shtml |title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i ))) |publisher=Indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line --&gt; |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/03/11/17262451.php |title=Media Activism, Indymedia History, Mar. 11, 2005 |publisher=Indybay.org |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Jackie|date=2001|title=Globalizing Resistance: The Battle of Seattle and the Future of Social Movements|url=|journal=Mobilization: An International Journal|volume=6(1)|pages=1-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dorothy Kidd quotes Sheri Herndon in a July 2001 telephone interview about the role of the Internet in the anti-[[WTO]] protests: "The timing was right, there was a space, the platform was created, the Internet was being used, we could bypass the corporate media, we were using [[open publishing]], we were using [[multimedia]] platforms. So those hadn't been available, and then there was the beginning of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;"Indymedia.org: A New Communications Common in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice'' pp. 59.

In the UK, in 1999, the Government introduced a new employment tax called IR35. One of the first online trade associations was created to campaign against it. Within weeks they had raised £100,000 off the Internet from individuals who had never even met. They became a fully formed trade association called the Professional Contractors Group, which two years later had 14,000 members all paying £100 each to join. They presented the first ever e-petition to Parliament and organized one of the first flash mobs when using their database, to their surprise and others, 1,000 came in their call to lobby Parliament. They later raised £500,000 from the Internet to fund an unsuccessful High Court challenge against the tax, though ultimately they secured some concessions. Their first external affairs director, Philip Ross, has written a history of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomtofreelance.blogspot.co.uk/ Freedom to Freelance – the online revolution and the fight against IR35] (Philip Ross, Lulu June 2012), {{ISBN|978-1-4717-3575-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engagement in the practice of strategic voting was another development that came with Internet activism. People coordinated their vote pairing by entering their contact information into an online database, thereby reducing cost completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Kimport|first2=Katrina|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=9780262015103|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The possibilities of online activism ==

Internet activism has had the effect of causing increased collective action among people, as found by Postmes and Brunsting (2002), who discovered a tendency among internet users to rely on internalized group memberships and social identities in order to achieve social involvement online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo_Sandoval_Almazan/publication/264827018_Towards_cyberactivism_20_Understanding_the_use_of_social_media_and_other_information_technologies_for_political_activism_and_social_movements/links/565bcad908aeafc2aac622a0.pdf|title=Towards cyberactivism 2.0? Understanding the use of social media and other information technologies for political activism and social movements}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Internet is "tailor-made for a populist, insurgent movement," says [[Joe Trippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204150800/http://www.slais.ubc.ca/COURSES/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |format=PDF |title=Citizen 2.0: How the Internet Shapes Citizen Participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who managed the [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Dean campaign]]. In his campaign memoir, ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,'' Trippi notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Internet's] roots in the [[open-source]] [[ARPAnet]], its [[hacker culture]], and its decentralized, scattered architecture make it difficult for big, establishment candidates, companies and media to gain control of it. And the establishment loathes what it can't control. This independence is by design, and the Internet [[community]] values above almost anything the distance it has from the slow, [[homogeneous]] stream of [[United States|American]] commerce and culture. Progressive candidates and companies with forward-looking vision have an advantage on the Internet, too. [[Television]] is, by its nature, a nostalgic [[Media (communication)|medium]]. Look at [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Ronald Reagan's campaign]] ads in the 1980s – they were masterpieces of nostalgia promising a return to America's past glory and [[prosperity]]. The Internet, on the other hand, is a forward-thinking and forward-moving medium, embracing change and pushing the envelope of [[technology]] and [[communication]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Use in political campaigns ===

When discussing the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] candidates, Carol Darr, director of the [[Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet]] at [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], said of the candidates which benefited from use of the Internet to attract supporters: "They are all charismatic, outspoken mavericks and insurgents. Given that the Internet is interactive and requires an affirmative action on the part of the users, as opposed to a passive response from TV users, it is not surprising that the candidate has to be someone people want to touch and interact with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html  "Website Reels In Political Newbies"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031005042314/http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html |date=2003-10-05 }} Hanstad, Chelsie Salisbury, Bill Pioneer Press, St. Paul, MO accessed February 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A more decentralized approach to campaigning arose, in contrast to a top-down, message-focused approach usually conducted in the mainstream. "The mantra has always been, 'Keep your message consistent. Keep your message consistent,'" said John Hlinko, who has participated in Internet campaigns for [[MoveOn.org]] and the electoral primary campaign of [[Wesley Clark]]. "That was all well and good in the past. Now it's a recipe for disaster ... You can choose to have a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] structure that's really doctrinaire and that's really opposed to grassroots. Or you can say, 'Go forth. Do what you're going to do.' As long as we're running in the same direction, it's much better to give some freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040924185855/http%3A//press.meetup.com/|date=2004-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds of Internet users under the age of 30 have a SNS, and during the 2008 election, half of them used a SNS site for candidate information (Hirzalla, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Hirzalla, F., van Zoonen, L., &amp; de Ridder, J. (2011). Internet Use and Political Participation: Reflections on the Mobilization/Normalization Controversy. Information Society, 27(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-traditional activism ===

The Internet has become the catalyst for protests such as [[Occupy Wall Street]] and the [[Arab Spring]] as those involved have increasingly relied on social media to organize and stay connected.
In [[Myanmar]], online news paper Freedom News Group has leaked some government corruption and fuel to protests.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/nyregion/wall-street-occupiers-protesting-till-whenever.html?_r=1&amp;ref=occupywallstreet | work=The New York Times | first1=N.

In 2017, the [[Sleeping Giants]] cyberactivist group, among others, launched a boycott campaign against controversial, conservative webpage [[Breitbart News]], getting more than 2,000 organizations to remove it from ad buys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40411086/activists-push-back-against-the-platforms-that-quietly-empower-hate-groups|title=Activists Are Pushing Back Against Tech Platforms That Quietly Empower Hate Groups|date=2017-05-09|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/boycott-breitbart-lyft-hewlett-packard-t-mobile-autodesk-uber-amazon/|title=Lyft, HP won't advertise on Breitbart.

=== Corporate activism ===
Corporations are also using Internet activist techniques to increase support for their causes. According to Christopher Palmeri with ''BusinessWeek'' Online, companies launch sites with the intent to positively influence their own public image, to provide negative pressure on competitors, to influence opinion within select groups, and to push for policy changes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Palmeri, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_02/c3865004_mz003.htm Up Front: How To Make A Corporate Cause Click], BusinessWeek Online, January 12, 2004.  retrieved October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing manufacturer, [[American Apparel]] is an example: The company hosts a website called [[Legalize LA]] that advocates [[immigration reform]] via blog, online advertising, links to news stories and educational materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |title=Legalize LA subpage |publisher=Americanapparel.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013143/http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news

Corporate methods of information dissemination is labelled "[[astroturfing]]," as opposed to "grassroots activism," due to the funding for such movements being largely private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html Anderson, Walter T. "Astroturf – The Big Business of Fake Grassroots Politics."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129034915/http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html |date=2011-01-29 }} Jinn 5 January 1996 accessed Feb 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; More recent examples include the right-wing [[FreedomWorks]].org which organized the "Taxpayer March on Washington" on September 12, 2009 and the Coalition to Protect Patients' Rights, which opposes universal health care in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectpatientsrights.org/ |title=IIS7 |publisher=Protectpatientsrights.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious activism ===

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. " In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental activism===
One of the earliest books on activism was Don Rittner's "Ecolinking - Everyone's Guide to Online Environmental Information," Published by Peachpit Press in 1992.  Rittner, an environmental activist from upstate New York, spent more than 20 years researching and saving the Albany Pine Barrens.  He was a beta tester for America Online and ran their Environmental Forum for the company from 1988 to when it launched in 1990.  He took his early environmental knowledge and computer savvy and wrote what was called the bible of the online environmental community.  It showed new Net users how to get online, find environmental information, connect to environmentalists around the world, and how to use those resources to save the planet.

=== Sexual Assault activism ===
Activism against sexual assault can be led on the internet, where individuals may feel comfortable talking about controversial topics. One such movements is the #NotGuilty movement. This movement began in April 2015 with Ione Wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/about/|title=About - #NotGuilty|work=#NotGuilty|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared a "letter to her attacker" in her college paper. The letter described how she was sexually assaulted and how she chose to respond and build from that point in her life. At the end of the letter she urged readers to send a letter back describing their own sexual assault experience with the hashtag #notguilty. She received so many letters from locals that she decided to create a website, this caused global attention and inspired many to share their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wells|first=Ione|title=How we talk about sexual assault online|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/ione_wells_how_we_talk_about_sexual_assault_online|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Me Too movement]] is a similar movement that started in Hollywood. [[Tarana Burke]] created the phrase to "empower women through empathy" and [[Alyssa Milano]] helped spread the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metoomvmt.org/|title=You Are Not Alone|last=Alone|first=You Are Not|website=You Are Not Alone|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/19/the-woman-behind-me-too-knew-the-power-of-the-phrase-when-she-created-it-10-years-ago/|title=The woman behind ‘Me Too’ knew the power of the phrase when she created it — 10 years ago|last=Ohlheiser|first=Abby|date=2017-10-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase was first used to demonstrate the amount of sexual assault that happens to young actresses and actors in Hollywood. It soon spread to apply to all forms of sexual assault, especially in the work place. These movements were intended to create an outlet for men and women to share their experiences with those with similar views without blame or guilt. They brought widespread attention to sexual assault and caused much controversy about changes that should be made accordingly. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=January 1, 2018|title=After #metoo|url=|journal=Nation|volume=306|pages=22-25|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism around movements such as these centers on concerns about whether or not participants are being dishonest for their own gain or are misinterpreting acts of kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://womensenews.org/2018/01/beware-the-metoo-backlash-it-masks-ugly-lies-about-women/|title=Beware the #MeToo Backlash—It Masks Ugly Lies About Women|work=Women's eNews|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on everyday political discussions ==

According to some observers, the Internet may have considerable potential to reach and engage opinion leaders who influence the thinking and behavior of others. According to the Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet, what they call "Online Political Citizens" (OPCs) are "seven times more likely than average citizens to serve as opinion leaders among their friends, relatives and colleagues… Normally, 10% of Americans qualify as Influentials. Our study found that 69% of Online Political Citizens are Influentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407090353/http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archivedate=2004-04-07 |format=PDF |title=Political Influentials in the 2004 Presidential campaign |publisher=Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet, Graduate School of Political Management |date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information communication technologies ==
Information communication technologies (ICTs) make communication and information readily available and efficient. There are millions of Facebook accounts, Twitter users and websites, and one can educate oneself on nearly any subject. While this is for the most part a positive thing, it can also be dangerous. For example, people can read up on the latest news events relatively easily and quickly; however, there is danger in the fact that apathy or fatigue can quickly arise when people are inundated with so many messages, or that the loudest voice on a subject can often be the most extreme one, distorting public perception on the issue.

These social networks which occupy ICTs are simply modern forms of political instruments which pre-date the technological era.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laura|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can now go to online forums or Twitter instead of town hall meetings. People can essentially mobilize worldwide through the Internet. Women can create transnational alliances and lobby for rights within their respective countries; they can give each other tips and share up-to-date information. This information becomes "hyper textual", available in downloadable formats with easy access for all.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN organizations also use "hyper textual" formats. They can post information about upcoming summits, they can post newsletters on what occurred at these meetings, and links to videos can be shared; all of this information can be downloaded at the click of a button.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN and many other actors are presenting this information in an attempt to get a certain message out in the cyber sphere and consequently steer public perception on an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laua|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all this information so readily available, there is a rising trend of "slacktivism" or "clicktivism".  While it is positive that information can be distributed so quickly and efficiently all around the world, there is negativity in the fact that people often take this information for granted, or quickly forget about it once they have seen it flash across our computer screens.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt;  Viral campaigns are great for sparking initial interest and conversation, but they are not as effective in the long term—people begin to think that clicking "like" on something is enough of a contribution, or that posting information about a current hot topic on their Facebook page or Twitter feed means that they have made a difference.

== Fundraising capability ==

The Internet has also made it easier for small donors to play a meaningful role in financing political campaigns. Previously, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}} Groups like [[MoveOn.org|MoveOn]], however, have found that they can raise large amounts of money from small donors at minimal cost, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. "For the first time, you have a door into the political process that isn't marked 'big money,' " says Darr. "That changes everything.

== Ethical Considerations ==
With [[internet]] technology vastly changing existing and introducing new mechanisms by which to attain, share and employ information, internet activism raises ethical issues for consideration. Proponents contend internet activism serves as an outlet for social progress but only if personal and professional ethics are employed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/770|title=Ethics in Online Activism: False Senses of Social Action or Effective Source of Change?|last=Jaber|first=Rimah|date=February 22, 2016|work=Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of online activism claim new information and communications technologies help increase the political power of activist groups that would otherwise have less resources. Proponents along this line of thinking claim the most effective use of online activism is its use in conjunction with more traditional or historical activism activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Pickerill, "Rethinking political participation: Experiments in internet activism in Australia and Britain." Curtin University of Technology, July, 2002. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, critics worry about facts and beliefs becoming indistinct in online campaigns and about "sectors of online activism [being] more self-interested than socially interested."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These critics warn against the manipulation commonplace to online activism for private or personal interests such as exploiting charities for monetary gain, influencing voters in the political arena and inflating self-importance or effectiveness. In this sense, the ethical implication is that activism becomes descriptive rather than transformative of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of these reviewers suggests seven pitfalls to beware of in internet activism: "self-promotion at the expense of the movement... unsolicited bulk [[email]]... [[Hacktivism]]... violating [[copyright]]... nagging... violating privacy... and being scary." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Head, "A Short Guide to the Ethics and Etiquette of Online Activism." Pearson, August 4, 2010. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical criticisms against the prevalence of online activism are further discussed in the criticisms section of this article.

== Criticism ==

=== Demographic issues ===
Critics argue that Internet activism faces the same challenges as other aspects of the [[digital divide]], particularly the [[global digital divide]]. Some say it gives disproportionate representation to those with greater access or technological ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |title=IRMJ01mcmanus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210154058/http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/digital-divide.html |title=Digital Divide: The Three Stages (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that may be disadvantaged by the move to activist activity online are those that have limited access to technologies, or lack the technological literacy to engage meaningfully online; these include ethnic and racial minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status, those with lower levels of education, and the elderly.

A study looked at the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) on various demographics and their political activity. Not surprisingly college students used SNS for political activity the most but this was followed by a more unlikely group, those that had not completed high school. In addition the probability for non-White citizens to consume political information was shown to be higher than that of Whites. These two outcomes go in the face of normal predictors of political activity. Despite these surprising findings older generations, men and whites showed the highest levels of political mobilization. Acts of political mobilization, such as fundraising, volunteering, protesting require the most continued interest, resources and knowledge (Nam, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2011). Whose e-democracy? The democratic divide in American electoral campaigns. Information Polity: The International Journal of Government &amp; Democracy in the Information Age, 16(2), 131-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real debate? ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The experience of the echo chamber is easier to create with a computer than with many of the forms of political interaction that preceded it," Sunstein told the ''[[New York Times]]''. "The discussion will be about strategy, or [[horse race journalism|horse-race issues]] or how bad the other candidates are, and it will seem like debate. It's not like this should be censored, but it can increase acrimony, increase extremism and make mutual understanding more difficult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Scott Duke Harris of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' noted that "the Internet connects [all sides of issues, not just] an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism|ANSWER]] to the pressed-for-time '[[soccer moms]]' who might prefer [[moveon.org|MoveOn]], and conservative activists as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=The Internet connects an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of A.N.S.W.E.R. to the pressed-for-time "soccer moms" who might prefer MoveOn, and conservative activists as well. And for its part, MoveOn is itself part of an anti-war coalition that includes the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women and the National Council of Churches.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, according to University of California professor Barbara Epstein, is that the Internet "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case." She warns that the impersonal nature of communication by computer may actually undermine the human contact that always has been crucial to social movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=All the Internet traffic may represent an "echo chamber" of virtual activism rather than meaningful protest, warns Barbara Epstein, a University of California-Santa Cruz professor of the history of consciousness. The Internet, she says, "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case."  The impersonal nature of communication by computer, Epstein suggests, may have a more insidious effect, undermining important human contact that always has been crucial to social movements. During the Vietnam War, "a large sector of a generation got drawn in, in a very personal way. They went to a protest because their roommate was going. The movement became the center of social life. It became the most exciting place on campus."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, expressed by author and law professor [[Cass Sunstein]], is that online political discussions lead to "[[cyberbalkanization]]"—discussions that lead to fragmentation and polarization rather than consensus, because the same medium that lets people access a large number of news sources also enables them to pinpoint the ones they agree with and ignore the rest.

=== Moving to offline action ===

Famed activist [[Ralph Nader]] has stated that "the Internet doesn't do a very good job of motivating action", citing that the [[United States Congress]], corporations and [[the Pentagon]] do not necessarily "fear the civic use of the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lasar |first=Matthew |url=https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/05/ralph-nader-internet-not-so-hot-at-motivating-action.ars |title=Ralph Nader: Internet not so hot at "motivating action" |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Zuckerman]] talks about "[[slacktivism]]", claiming that the Internet has devalued certain currencies of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.causebuilder.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124121745/http://www.causebuilder.info/ |archivedate=2012-11-24 |title=Causebuilder Resources and Information |publisher=Causebuilder.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens may "like" an activist group on [[Facebook]], visit a website, or comment on a blog, but fail to engage in political activism beyond the Internet, such as volunteering or canvassing. This critique has been criticized as Western-centric, however, because it discounts the impact this can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2E2T9GFaE |title=Cyberactivism and the Arab Revolt: Battles Waged Online and Lessons Learned (Part 1 of 9) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argued that even this low level of engagement was an important form of activism for [[Arab]] youth because it is a form of free speech, and can spark mainstream media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-CyberactivismAndWomen-051712.pdf |title=Unveiling the Revolutionaries: Cyberactivism and Women's Role in the Arab Uprisings|author=Radsch, Courtney|publisher=Rice University | date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slacktivism ===

Scholars are divided as to whether the Internet will increase or decrease political participation, including online activism. Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the Internet will decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism.

=== Clicktivism ===

Another criticism is clicktivism. According to techopedia, clicktivism is a controversial form of digital activism. Proponents believe that applying advertising principles such as A/B testing increases the impact of a message by leveraging the Internet to further its reach. Opponents believe that clicktivism reduces activism to a mere mouse-click, yielding numbers with little or no real engagement or commitment to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janssen |first=Cory |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28184/clicktivism |title=What is Clicktivism? - Definition from |publisher=Techopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Micah M. White]] argues, "Political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links.

This article has numerous edit wars by proponents of various inventors related to the of the invention of the ELECTROMAGNETIC telephone.
The article is meant to be an unbiased encyclopedic work detailing the FACTS of the invention of the telephone. You are free to add or edit material related to the primacy of the telephone's invention, if you can cite references BASED in''' RELIABLE PRIMARY SOURCES of anyone who invented an electromagnetic telephone prior to Bell — the person who invented and documented an electrical telephone in Brantford, Ontario in the summer of 1874 (for confirmation of this date, view this monument photo: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexander_Graham_Bell_Brantford_Monument_23.4D38.jpg). The summer of 1874 represents the legal 'date of invention', not the 'date of construction' nor the 'date of patenting'. There are legal definitions for philosophy, undocumented materials, or materials based on UNDOCUMENTED primary sources before 1874 related to the primacy of invention of an electromagnetic telephone, as they will be immediately deleted per Wikipedia's MOS policies.

The '''invention of the telephone''' was the culmination of work done by many individuals, and led to an array of lawsuits relating to the [[Claim (patent)|patent claims]] of several individuals and numerous companies. The first telephone was invented by [[Antonio Meucci]], but [[Alexander Graham Bell]] is credited with the development of the first practical telephone.

== Early developments ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--Bourseul section and Reis/Meucci sections need more--&gt;
{{Further|Electrical telegraph|Timeline of the telephone|History of the telephone}}
The concept of the telephone dates back to the string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]]s connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the [[University of Göttingen]], in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/32448.html Erster elektromagnetischer Telegraph der Welt über den Dächern von Göttingen] (First electromagnetic telegraph in the world over the roofs of Göttingen), Georg-August-Universität Göttingen website. Retrieved January 22, 2013. {{de-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charles Grafton Page ===

In 1840, American [[Charles Grafton Page]] passed an electric current through a coil of wire placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet. He called this effect "galvanic music".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/bluetelephone/]{{dead link|date=November 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innocenzo Manzetti ===

[[Innocenzo Manzetti]] considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an [[automaton]] built by him in 1849.

=== Charles Bourseul ===

[[Charles Bourseul]] was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a "make-and-break" telephone in 1854. That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy .

Bourseul explained: "Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disc sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice; that this disc alternately makes and breaks the currents from a battery: you may have at a distance another disc which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations.... It is certain that, in a more or less distant future, a speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made experiments in this direction; they are delicate and demand time and patience, but the approximations obtained promise a favorable result."

=== Johann Philipp Reis ===

[[File:DBP 1984 1198 Philipp Reis.jpg|thumb|right|A stamp dedicated to Johann Philipp Reis]]

The [[Reis telephone]] was developed from 1857 on. Allegedly, the transmitter was difficult to operate, since the relative position of the needle and the contact were critical to the device's operation. Thus, it can be called a "telephone", since it did transmit voice sounds electrically over distance, but was hardly a commercially practical telephone in the modern sense.

Thomas Edison tested the Reis equipment and found that "single words, uttered as in reading, speaking and the like, were perceptible indistinctly, notwithstanding here also the inflections of the voice, the modulations of interrogation, wonder, command, etc., attained distinct expression."&lt;ref&gt;Coe, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Reis device was tested by the British company [[Standard Telephones and Cables]] (STC). The results also confirmed it could transmit and receive speech with good quality (fidelity), but relatively low intensity. At the time STC was bidding for a contract with Alexander Graham Bell's [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]], and the results were covered up by STC's chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell's reputation.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Antonio Meucci ===

An early voice communicating device was invented around 1854 by [[Antonio Meucci]], who called it a ''telettrofono''. In 1871 Meucci filed a [[patent caveat|caveat]] at the US Patent Office{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. His caveat describes his invention, but does not mention a diaphragm, electromagnet, conversion of sound into electrical waves, conversion of electrical waves into sound, or other essential features of an electromagnetic telephone.

[[File:Antonio Meucci.jpg|thumb|Antonio Meucci, c.1880]]

The first American demonstration of Meucci's invention took place in [[Staten Island]], New York in 1854{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. In 1860, a description of it was reportedly published in an Italian-language New York newspaper, although no known copy of that newspaper issue or article has survived to the present day{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his [[Antonio Meucci#Caveat|1871 U.S. patent caveat]]. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's transmitter-receivers being insulated from a 'ground return' path.

In the 1880s Meucci was credited with the early invention of inductive loading of telephone wires to increase long-distance signals{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Unfortunately, serious burns from an accident, a lack of English, and poor business abilities resulted in Meucci's failing to develop his inventions commercially in America. Meucci demonstrated some sort of instrument in 1849 in [[Havana, Cuba]], however, this may have been a variant of a [[Tin can telephone|string telephone]] that used wire. Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-[[sidetone]] circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to sidetone was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The anti-sidetone circuit later introduced by Bell Telephone instead canceled sidetone through a feedback process.

An [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) laboratory reportedly lost some of Meucci's working models, his wife reportedly disposed of others and Meucci, who sometimes lived on public assistance, chose not to renew his 1871 ''teletrofono'' [[patent caveat]] after 1874{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

A resolution was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2002 that said Meucci did pioneering work on the development of the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:H.RES.269: House Resolution 269]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Andrew.

Web. 21 Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution said that "if Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell."

The Meucci resolution by the US Congress was promptly followed by a Canada legislative motion by [[37th Canadian Parliament|Canada's 37th Parliament]], declaring [[Alexander Graham Bell]] as the inventor of the telephone. Others in Canada disagreed with the Congressional resolution, some of whom provided [[Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell#Critical views of both the Bell Parliamentary Motion and Resolution HRes 269|criticisms of both its accuracy and intent]].

==== Chronology of Meucci's invention ====

A retired director general of the [[Telecom Italia]] central telecommunications research institute ([[CSELT]]), Basilio Catania,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chezbasilio.org/ Basilio Catania Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Italian Society of Electrotechnics, "Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica", have devoted a Museum to Antonio Meucci, constructing a chronology of his invention of the telephone and tracing the history of the two legal trials involving Meucci and Alexander Graham Bell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_intel.htm L'invenzione del telefono da parte di Meucci e la sua sventurata e ingiusta conclusione]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chezbasilio.org/meucci.htm Meucci], ChezBasilio.org website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_hpg1.htm aei.it website]&lt;/ref&gt;

They claim that Meucci was the actual inventor of the telephone, and base their argument on reconstructed evidence. What follows, if not otherwise stated, is a [[résumé]] of their historic reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chezbasilio.org/immagini/meucci-bell.pdf Basilio Catania's reconstruction, in English]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre "Teatro della Pergola" in Florence. This telephone is constructed on the model of pipe-telephones on ships and is still working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_tela.htm Picture of the acoustic telephone, page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat [[rheumatism]]. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the "tongue" of copper wire was vibrating just like a leaf of an electroscope; which means that there was an electrostatic effect. In order to continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he heard inarticulated human voice. He called this device "telegrafo parlante" (litt. "talking telegraph").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_voce.htm Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On the basis of this prototype, Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of sound transmitting devices inspired by the telegraph model as did other pioneers of the telephone, such as [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Philipp Reis]], [[Innocenzo Manzetti]] and others. Meucci later claimed that he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph "make-and-break" method, but he looked for a "continuous" solution that did not interrupt the electric current.
* Meucci later claimed that he constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and keeping a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was hosted in a cylindrical carton box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_t1em.htm Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042803/http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_t1em.htm |date=July 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he constructed this as a way to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his wife who was an [[Patient|invalid]].
* Meucci separated the two directions of transmission in order to eliminate the so-called "local effect", adopting what we would call today a 4-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator which short-circuited the instrument of the calling person, producing in the instrument of the called person a succession of impulses (clicks), much more intense than those of normal conversation. As he was aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called "skin effect" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron). He successfully used an insulated copper plait, thus anticipating the [[litz wire]] used by [[Nikola Tesla]] in RF coils.
* In 1864 Meucci later claimed that he realized his "best device", using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm.
* In August 1870, Meucci later claimed that he obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper plait insulated by cotton. He called his device "teletrofono". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci dated September 27, 1870, show coils of wire on long-distance telephone lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.it/ita/museo/mam_cain.htm Affidavit of lawyer Michael Lemmi]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting made by Nestore Corradi [[:it:Nestore Corradi]] in 1858 mentions the sentence "Electric current from the inductor pipe"

The above information was published in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' Supplement No. 520 of December 19, 1876,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/3/4/0/13401/13401-h/13401-h.htm#13 Scientific American Supplement No. 520, December 19, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt; based on reconstructions produced in 1885, for which there was no contemporary pre-1875 evidence. Meucci's 1871 [[Patent caveat|caveat]] did not mention any of the telephone features later credited to him by his lawyer, and which were published in that Scientific American Supplement, a major reason for the loss of the 'Bell v. Globe and Meucci' patent infringement court case, which was decided against Globe and Meucci.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.meetup.com/1004848/MeucciMarch07.pdf Meucci's 1871 patent caveat, pages 16-18]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Antonio Meucci#Patent caveat|Antonio Meucci – Patent caveat]], for the full printed text of his 1871 teletrofono patent caveat.

== Electro-magnetic transmitters and receivers ==

=== Elisha Gray ===

{{See also|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}

[[Elisha Gray]], of [[Highland Park, Illinois]] (near Chicago) also devised a tone telegraph of this kind about the same time as La Cour. In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the other end of the line passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies – that is to say, more than one musical tone – can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the harmonic telegraph can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. patent 166,096 for "Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones" (the harmonic)

On February 14, 1876, at the US Patent Office, Gray's lawyer filed a [[patent caveat]] for a telephone on the very same day that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's patent application for a telephone. The [[water microphone|water transmitter]] described in Gray's caveat was strikingly similar to the experimental telephone transmitter tested by Bell on March 10, 1876, a fact which raised questions about whether Bell (who knew of Gray) was inspired by Gray's design or vice versa. Although Bell did not use Gray's water transmitter in later telephones, evidence suggests that Bell's lawyers may have obtained an unfair advantage over Gray.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inventors Digest]], July/August 1998, p. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alexander Graham Bell ===

[[File:AGBell Notebook.jpg|thumb|right|Bell's March 10, 1876, laboratory notebook entry describing his first successful experiment with the telephone]]
&lt;!-- irrelevant biographical information removed. I put it here for public reference:
He was a British (Scottish-born), Canadian, and naturalized American in 1882, scientist and inventor; he is most famous for his pioneering work on the development of the telephone, and obtaining key patents. Alexander Graham Bell was born on 3 March 1847 in Edinburgh and educated there and in London. His father and grandfather were both authorities on elocution and at the age of 16 Bell himself began researching the mechanics of speech. In 1870, Bell emigrated with his family to Canada, and the following year he moved to the United States to teach. --&gt;[[Alexander Graham Bell]] had pioneered a system called visible speech, developed by his father, to teach deaf children. In 1872 Bell founded a school in Boston to train teachers of the deaf. The school subsequently became part of Boston University, where Bell was appointed professor of vocal physiology in 1873. He became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1882.
Bell had long been fascinated by the idea of transmitting speech, and by 1875 had come up with a simple receiver that could turn electricity into sound. Others were working along the same lines, including an Italian-American Antonio Meucci, and debate continues as to who should be credited with inventing the telephone. However, Bell was granted a patent for the telephone on 7 March 1876 and it developed quickly. Within a year the first telephone exchange was built in Connecticut and the Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, with Bell the owner of a third of the shares, quickly making him a wealthy man.
In 1880, Bell was awarded the French [[Volta Prize]] for his invention and with the money, founded the Volta Laboratory in Washington, where he continued experiments in communication, in medical research, and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf, working with Helen Keller among others. In 1885 he acquired land in Nova Scotia and established a summer home there where he continued experiments, particularly in the field of aviation.
In 1888, Bell was one of the founding members of the National Geographic Society, and served as its president from 1896 to 1904, also helping to establish its journal.
Bell died on 2 August 1922 at his home in Nova Scotia.

[[Alexander Graham Bell]] is the inventor of the first practical telephone. The classic story of him saying "Watson, come here! I want to see you!" is a well-known part of the history of the telephone. This showed that the telephone worked, but it was a short-range phone.&lt;ref&gt;American Treasures of the Library of Congress ... Bell - Lab notebook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Puleo|first=Stephen|date=2011|title=A City So Grand: The Rise of an American Metropolis, Boston 1850-1900 |isbn=978-0807001493|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was the first to obtain a patent, in 1876, for an "apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically", after experimenting with many primitive sound transmitters and receivers. Bell was also an astute and articulate businessman with influential and wealthy friends.

As Professor of Vocal Physiology at [[Boston University]], Bell was engaged in training teachers in the art of instructing the deaf how to speak and experimented with the [[Leon Scott]] [[phonautograph]] in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line on a plate of [[smoked glass]]. The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bruce (1990), pages 102–103, 110–113, 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

This background prepared Bell for work with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873-1874 with a harmonic telegraph, following the examples of Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or tuning fork to vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bruce (1990), pages 104–109&lt;/ref&gt;

During a June 2, 1875, experiment by Bell and his assistant [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]], a receiver reed failed to respond to the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was at the other end of the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bruce (1990), pages 146–148&lt;/ref&gt; A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.

After Bell and Watson discovered on June 2, 1875, that movements of the reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of [[goldbeater's skin]] with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate in front of the pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter.&lt;ref name="Robert Bruce 1990, page 149"&gt;Robert Bruce (1990), page 149&lt;/ref&gt; This was the "gallows" phone. A few days later they were tried together, one at each end of the line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Puleo|first=Stephen|date=2011|title=A City So Grand: The Rise of an American Metropolis, Boston 1850-1900 |isbn=978-0807001493|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, "Do you understand what I say?" and Watson answered "Yes". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane.

Because of illness and other commitments, Bell made little or no telephone improvements or experiments for eight months until after his U.S. patent 174,465 was published.&lt;ref name="Robert Bruce 1990, page 149"/&gt;

=== Bell's success ===
[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: "Improvement in Telegraphy" filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing, March 7, 1876]]
[[File:Telephone Centennial Issue 1976-13c.jpg|thumb|right\240px|Bell's Prototype [[History of the telephone|Telephone]] Centennial Issue of 1976]]

The first successful bi-directional transmission of clear speech by Bell and Watson was made on March 10, 1876, when Bell spoke into the device, "Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you." and Watson answered. Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter design&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, pages 36-37. Bell's lab notes dated March 9, 1876 show a drawing of a person speaking face down into a liquid transmitter very similar to the liquid transmitter depicted as Fig. 3 in Gray's caveat.&lt;/ref&gt; in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's telephone transmitter (microphone) consisted of a double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron "armature" induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air.

This primitive telephone was rapidly improved. The double electromagnet was replaced by a single permanently magnetized [[magnet|bar magnet]] having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the [[magnetic field]] of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct.

The first long distance telephone call was made on August 10, 1876, by Bell from the family homestead in [[Brantford, Ontario]], to his assistant located in [[Paris, Ontario]], some 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) apart.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Public demonstrations ====

===== Early public demonstrations of Bell's telephone =====
{{Further information|Bell Telephone Company#Early promotional success}}

&lt;!-- After demonstrating his invention to small groups of academics [preceding text pending confirmation --&gt;Bell exhibited a working telephone at the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]] in June 1876, where it attracted the attention of Brazilian emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] plus the [[physicist]] and engineer [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 at a meeting of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, "I heard [through the telephone] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (I failed to make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!' All this my own ears heard spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the then circular disc armature of just such another little electro-magnet as this I hold in my hand."

===== Three great tests of the telephone =====

Only a few months after receiving U.S. Patent No. 174465 at the beginning of March 1876, Bell conducted three important tests of his new invention and the telephone technology after returning to his parents' home at Melville House (now the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site]]) for the summer.

In the first test call on August 3, 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke to him from the Brantford telegraph office, reciting lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' ("''To be or not to be....''").&lt;ref name="CWB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Toronto Star-1970.12.26"&gt;"You Can Tour The House in Brantford Where Bell Worked on His Telephone", ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'', December 26, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the neighboring community of [[County of Brant#Communities|Mount Pleasant]],&lt;ref name="CWB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Elizabeth. ''Alexander Graham Bell: An Inventive Life'', Toronto, Ontario, Canada: Kids Can Press, 1999, {{ISBN|1-55074-456-9}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; received and may possibly have transferred his uncle's voice onto a [[phonautograph|phonautogram]], a drawing made on a pen-like recording device that could produce the shapes of [[sound|sound waves]] as [[waveform]]s onto smoked glass or other media by tracing their vibrations.

The next day on August 4 another call was made between Brantford's telegraph office and Melville House, where a large dinner party exchanged "....speech, recitations, songs and instrumental music".&lt;ref name="CWB" /&gt; To bring telephone signals to Melville House, Alexander Graham audaciously "bought up" and "cleaned up" the complete supply of stovepipe wire in Brantford.&lt;ref name="Brantford Expositor-1936.08.10c"&gt;"Bell Emphatic in Declaring That Telephone Was Invented Here", ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', August 10, 1936, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brantford Expositor-1936.08.10b"&gt;"Use of Stove Pipe Wire Is Related at Banquet: Graham Tells Of Some Early Experiments", ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', August 10, 1936, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of two of his parents' neighbours,&lt;ref&gt;Patten, William; Bell, Alexander Melville.

N.B.: Patten's full name was William Patten, not Gulielmus Patten as credited elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; he tacked the stovepipe wire some 400 metres (a quarter mile) along the top of fence posts from his parents' home to a junction point on the telegraph line to the neighbouring community of Mount Pleasant, which joined it to the Dominion Telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Patten &amp; Bell, 1926, p. 15–16, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell Canada THC-1954"&gt;"The Bell Homestead", Montreal, Canada: Telephone Historical Collection, [[Bell Canada|The Bell Telephone Co. of Canada]], December 29, 1954, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and most important test was the world's first true long-distance telephone call, placed between Brantford and [[Paris, Ontario]] on August 10, 1876.&lt;ref name="Brantford Expositor-2002"&gt;Harrington, Stephanie.

The normal telegraph line between Paris and Brantford was not quite 13&amp;nbsp;km (8 miles) long, but the connection was extended a further 93&amp;nbsp;km (58 miles) to [[Toronto]] to allow the use of a battery in its [[telegraphy|telegraph office]].&lt;ref name="CWB"&gt;"First Telephone Office", ''CWB'', November 17, 1971, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toronto Star-1987.04.25"&gt;"A .G.

===== Later public demonstrations =====

A later telephone design was publicly exhibited on May 4, 1877, at a lecture given by Professor Bell in the [[Boston Music Hall]]. According to a report quoted by John Munro in ''Heroes of the Telegraph'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''
Going to the small telephone box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. Bell coolly asked, as though addressing someone in an adjoining room, "Mr. Watson, are you ready!"  Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience "I will switch off the song from one part of the room to another so that all can hear." At a subsequent lecture in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Munro, John.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Summary of Bell's achievements ====

Bell did for the telephone what [[Henry Ford]] did for the automobile. Although not the first to experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented the telephone industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Variable resistance transmitters ==

=== Water microphone – Elisha Gray ===

[[Elisha Gray]] recognized the lack of fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by analogy with the [[Tin can telephone|lover's telegraph]], that if the current could be made to more closely model the movements of the diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved. Gray filed a [[patent caveat]] with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a [[water microphone|liquid microphone]]. The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed – just barely – into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture. In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the needle dipped more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell.

When Gray applied for a patent for the variable resistance telephone transmitter, the [[United States Patent Office|Patent Office]] determined "while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the ([[Liquid rheostat|variable resistance]]) invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered."&lt;ref&gt;Burton Baker, pages 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon microphone – Thomas Edison, Edward Hughes, Emile Berliner ===
The carbon microphone  was independently developed around 1878 by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention.

[[Thomas Alva Edison]] took the next step in improving the telephone with his invention in 1878 of the [[Carbon microphone|carbon grain "transmitter"]] (microphone) that provided a strong voice signal on the transmitting circuit that made long-distance calls practical. Edison discovered that carbon grains, squeezed between two metal plates, had a variable [[electrical resistance]] that was related to the pressure. Thus, the grains could vary their resistance as the plates moved in response to sound waves, and reproduce sound with good fidelity, without the weak signals associated with electromagnetic transmitters.

The carbon microphone was further improved by [[Emile Berliner]], [[Francis Blake (telephone)|Francis Blake]], [[David E. Hughes]], [[Henry Hunnings]], and [[Anthony C. White|Anthony White]]. The carbon microphone remained standard in telephony until the 1980s, and is still being produced.

== Improvements to the early telephone ==

Additional inventions such as the [[Ringing (telephony)|call bell]], [[telephone exchange|central telephone exchange]], [[common battery]], [[ringtone|ring tone]], [[Amplifier|amplification]], [[trunking|trunk lines]], and wireless phones – at first [[cordless telephone|cordless]] and then fully [[mobile phone|mobile]] – made the telephone the useful and widespread apparatus it is now.

=== Telephone exchanges ===

The telephone exchange was an idea of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] engineer [[Tivadar Puskás]] (1844–1893) in 1876, while he was working for [[Thomas Edison]] on a telegraph exchange.&lt;ref&gt;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204071321/http://hungarian-history.hu/mszh/epuskas.htm Puskás Tivadar (1844–1893)] (short biography), Hungarian History website. Retrieved from Archive.org, February 2013.

&lt;/ref&gt; Puskás was working on his idea for an [[electrical telegraph]] exchange when [[Alexander Graham Bell]] received the first patent for the telephone. This caused Puskás to take a fresh look at his own work and he refocused on perfecting a design for a [[telephone exchange]]. He then got in touch with the U.S. inventor [[Thomas Edison]] who liked the design. According to Edison, "Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin.

== Controversies==
{{Further information|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}
{{See also|Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell}}

Bell has been widely recognized as the "inventor" of the telephone outside of Italy, where Meucci was championed as its inventor. In the United States, there are numerous reflections of Bell as a North American icon for inventing the telephone, and the matter was for a long time non-controversial. In June 2002, however, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a symbolic bill recognizing the contributions of Antonio Meucci ''"&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt; the invention of the telephone"'' (not ''"&lt;u&gt;for&lt;/u&gt; the invention of the telephone"''), throwing the matter into some controversy. Ten days later the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] countered with a symbolic motion conferring official recognition for the invention of the telephone to Bell.

Champions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray have each offered fairly precise tales of a contrivance whereby Bell actively stole the invention of the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a look at his rival's designs before final submission{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

One of the valuable claims in Bell's 1876 {{US patent|174465}} was claim 4, a method of producing variable electric current in a circuit by varying the resistance in the circuit. That feature was not shown in any of Bell's [[patent drawing]]s, but was shown in Elisha Gray's drawings in his [[Patent caveat|caveat]] filed the same day, February 14, 1876. A description of the variable resistance feature, consisting of seven sentences, was inserted into Bell's application. That it was inserted is not disputed. But when it was inserted is a controversial issue. Bell testified that he wrote the sentences containing the variable resistance feature before January 18, 1876, "almost at the last moment" before sending his draft application to his lawyers. A book by Evenson&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, pp 64–69, 86–87, 110, 194–196&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the seven sentences and claim 4 were inserted, without Bell's knowledge, just before Bell's application was hand carried to the Patent Office by one of Bell's lawyers on February 14, 1876.

Contrary to the popular story, Gray's caveat was taken to the US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and remained near the bottom of the in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, pages 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.

== Memorial to the invention ==
{{Main|Bell Telephone Memorial}}

In 1906 the citizens of the City of [[Brantford|Brantford, Ontario]], Canada and [[County of Brant|its surrounding area]] formed the Bell Memorial Association to commemorate the invention of the telephone by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in July 1874 at his parent's home, Melville House, near Brantford.&lt;ref name ="Whitaker"&gt;

(1943) [http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/abell.pdf ''Biographical Memoir of Alexander Graham Bell''], [[National Academy of Sciences]]: Biographical Memoirs, Vol. XXIII, 1847–1922. Presented to the Academy at its 1943 annual meeting.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Seymour Allward|Walter Allward]]'s design was the unanimous choice from among 10 submitted models, winning the competition. The memorial was originally to be completed by 1912 but Allward did not finish it until five years later. The [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire]], ceremoniously unveiled the memorial on October 24, 1917.&lt;ref name ="Whitaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAS" /&gt;

Allward designed the monument to symbolize the telephone's ability to overcome distances.&lt;ref name="NAS" /&gt; A series of steps lead to the main section where the floating allegorical figure of ''[[Artistic inspiration|Inspiration]]'' appears over a reclining male figure representing ''Man, discovering his power to transmit sound through space'', and also pointing to three floating figures, the messengers of ''[[Knowledge]]'', ''[[Joy]]'', and ''[[Sorrow (emotion)|Sorrow]]'' positioned at the other end of the tableau. Additionally, there are two female figures mounted on granite pedestals representing ''Humanity'' positioned to the left and right of the memorial, one sending and the other receiving a message.&lt;ref name ="Whitaker" /&gt;

The Bell Telephone Memorial's grandeur has been described as the finest example of Allward's early work, propelling the sculptor to fame. The memorial itself has been used as a central fixture for many civic events and remains an important part of Brantford's history, helping the city style itself as'' 'The Telephone City'.''

==Early life and education==
Holdren was born in [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in [[San Mateo, California]].&lt;ref name=belfer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18738/harvard_kennedy_schools_john_p_holdren_named_obamas_science_advisor.html?breadcrumb=%252Ftopic%252F64%252Fscience_and_technology%253Fpage%253D4|title=Harvard Kennedy School's John P.

Holdren was involved in the famous [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]] in 1980. He, along with two other scientists helped [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] establish the bet with [[Julian Simon]], in which they bet that the price of five key metals would be higher in 1990. The bet was centered around a disagreement concerning the future scarcity of resources in an increasingly polluted and heavily populated world. Ehrlich and Holdren lost the bet, when the price of metals had decreased by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holdren was chair of the Executive Committee of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]] from 1987 until 1997 and delivered the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] acceptance lecture on behalf of Pugwash Conferences in December 1995. From 1993 until 2003, he was chair of the [[Committee on International Security and Arms Control]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and Co-Chairman of the bipartisan National Committee on Energy Policy from 2002 until 2007. Holdren was elected [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) (2006–2007), and served as board Chairman (2007–2008).&lt;ref name="newsrelease"/&gt; He was the founding chair of the advisory board for ''[[Innovations (journal)|Innovations]]'', a quarterly journal about entrepreneurial solutions to global challenges published by MIT Press, and has written and lectured extensively on the topic of [[global warming]].

Holdren served as one of President [[Bill Clinton]]'s science advisors (PCAST) from 1994 to 2001.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; Eight years later, President Barack Obama nominated Holdren for the position of science advisor and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in December 2008, and he was [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] on March 19, 2009, by a unanimous vote in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Staff and news service reports.

===Writings===
[[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] was an early concern and interest. In a 1969 article, Holdren and co-author [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] argued, "if the population control measures are not initiated immediately, and effectively, all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPanaceas"&gt;Paul R. Erlich and John P. Holdren. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1294858 "Population and Panaceas A Technological Perspective"], ''Bioscience'', Vol 19, pages 1065-1071, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Holdren encouraged a decline in fertility to well below replacement in the United States, because "210 million now is too many and 280 million in 2040 is likely to be much too many."&lt;ref name="PopulationsPredicament"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7jjp9bv0qNYC&amp;dq=no+growth+society&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA31,M1 | journal = Daedalus, the No-Growth Society | year = 1973 | title = Population and the American Predicament: The Case Against Complacency | first = John P. | isbn = 978-0-7130-0136-5 | last = Holdren | pages = 31&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Paul R.

'''LASCO''' is the Laboratory for the Analysis of Organizational Communication Systems of the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] (UCL), located in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] and [[Mons]] in [[Belgium]].

The LASCO was created in February 2000 as part of the Communication Department of the  [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Its founders were Pierre de Saint-Georges, Axel Gryspeerdt and Vincent Defourny. LASCO has been chaired by [[Thierry Libaert]] and François Lambotte; since 2015, it is chaired by Andrea Catellani.

The LASCO brings together researchers of different origins, united by the common aim of observing and analysing internal and external, strategic and spontaneous phenomena in the field of [[Organizational Communication]], [[Public relations|Public Relations]], [[Corporate communication|Corporate Communication]] and [[Strategic communication|Strategic Communication]]. Such phenomena are to be considered as the origins and consequences of interactions occurred within organizations, or produced by them.

The LASCO originated from the consistent continuation of work done inside the Communication Department in the [[Public Relations]] sector (from 1961 onwards, via the CETEDI, Centre of Diffusion Techniques and Public Relations) and of Institutional Mediation (from 1994 on). Correlations between communication and organizations have always constituted a traditional research field at the Communication Department at the Université catholique de Louvain. The Université catholique de Louvain is thereby a Europe-wide recognised pioneer in this area: Organisational Communication has been taught since 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Catellani: Un laboratoire de recherche en transformation: le Lasco de l'Université catholique de Louvain.

'''Larry Downes''' (born March 1, 1959) is an Internet industry analyst and author on business strategies and information technology. Downes is best known for his first book, ''Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance'' (Harvard Business School 1998), which focuses on the potential of products and services for dramatically changing business. ''Unleashing the Killer App'' sold over 200,000 copies and was named by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' one of the five most important books on [[business]] and the [[Internet]] ever published. Downes is also the author of ''The Laws of Disruption: Harnessing the New Forces that Govern Business and Life in the Digital Age.''

His most recent book, co-authored with Paul Nunes, is ''Big Bang Disruption: Strategy in the Age of Devastating Innovation''.

Downes writes regularly for a variety of publications, including ''The Washington Post'', ''Harvard Business Review'', ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;ref name="Forbes Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.forbes.com/larrydownes/ | title=Laws of Disruption |work=Forbes | accessdate=August 4, 2011 | first=Larry | last=Downes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNet]] about such issues as [[net neutrality]], the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and disruptive innovation generally.

He has testified frequently before Congress on technology policy.  On February 15, 2011, he testified in front of Congress against the FCC's net neutrality rules, the so-called "Open Internet" rule, which prohibits blocking of lawful content and bans various forms of discrimination in the handling of specific data packets.&lt;ref name="Downes FCC Testimony"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techfreedom.org/files/publications/2011/Downes-Net-Neutrality-Written-Testimony.pdf |title=Ensuring Competition on the Internet: Net Neutrality &amp; Antitrust |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |author=Downes, Larry |pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a critic of over-regulation and an advocate of increased competition. His writings have appeared in various newspapers and magazines around the world, including ''[[Forbes]]'', [[CNet]], ''[[USA Today]]'',&lt;ref name="Mouse Creativity"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2002-10-07-oplede_x.htm |title='Free the Mouse' for creativity's sake |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |author=Downes, Larry |date=October 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name="Commerce Clause"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hbr.org/2005/09/the-commerce-clause-wakes-up/ar/1 |title=The Commerce Clause Wakes Up |date=September 2005 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |author=Downes, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', and the ''[[Harvard Journal of Law and Technology]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16600">This is a list of some of the major unsolved problems, puzzles, or questions in economics. Some of these are theoretical in origin and some of them concern the inability of orthodox economic theory to explain an empirical observation.

==Capital Theory==
{{main|Capital (economics)}}
*'''[[Cambridge capital controversy]]''':The Cambridge capital controversy is a dispute in economics that started in the 1950s. The debate concerned the nature and role of capital goods and a critique of the neoclassical vision of aggregate production and distribution. The question of whether the natural growth rate is exogenous, or endogenous to demand (and whether it is input growth that causes output growth, or vice versa), lies at the heart of the debate. The resolution of the debate has not been agreed upon by economists.
*'''[[Transformation problem]]''':The transformation problem is the problem of finding a general rule by which to transform the values of commodities based on socially necessary labor time into the competitive prices of the marketplace.  The essential difficulty is how to reconcile profit in the form of surplus value from direct labour inputs and the ratio of direct labour input to capital input that vary widely between commodities, with the tendency toward an average rate of profit on all capital invested.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.A. (1971) "Understanding the Marxian Notion of Exploitation: A Summary of the So-Called Transformation Problem Between Marxian Values and Competitive Prices" Journal of Economic Literature 9 2 399–431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral economics==
{{main|Behavioral economics}}
*'''[[Revealed preference]]''': Does Revealed Preference theory truly reveal consumer preference when the consumer is able to afford all of the available options? For example, if a consumer is confronted with three goods and they can afford to purchase all three (A, B, and C) and they choose to first purchase A, then C, and then B - does this suggest that the consumer preference for the goods is A &gt; C &gt; B? The debate rests on the fact that since the consumer can afford all three goods and does not need to make a preferential decision, does the order of consumption reflect any preference?&lt;ref name=Morgenstern&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Oskar Morgenstern]]|year=1972|title=Thirteen critical points in contemporary economic theory|journal=[[Journal of Economic Literature]]|volume=10|pages=1163&amp;ndash;1189|jstor=2721542}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Tâtonnement]]''': The act of tâtonnement plays a key role in the formulation of [[general equilibrium theory]]. The claim is that if an initial contract does not lead to an equilibrium, it is ended and new contracts are formulated. If the initial contract is not called off, it will likely lead to a different set of prices, depending on the degree of error in the original process. The question is whether successive re-contracting continues with the parties forgetting the previously planned positions taken or whether the parties engage in a form of tâtonnement to achieve optimality.&lt;ref name=Morgenstern /&gt; See also [[Hill climbing]] and [[Walrasian auction]].
*'''Unified models of human biases''': Neoclassical economics has concentrated on the development of models that reflect an idealized economic agent, sometimes referred to as [[Homo economicus]], as a way of studying economics. In the period spanning the 1970s to the 1990s, research began to emerge that suggested that people were subject to cognitive biases such as the [[framing effect]], [[loss aversion]], the [[gambler's fallacy]], [[confirmation bias]], and many others. Further, these effects could produce anomalies such as [[herd behavior]] or [[momentum investing]] inconsistent with economic models that did not incorporate human psychological limitations.&lt;ref name=behavior&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Foundations of Behavioral and Experimental Economics: Daniel Kahneman and Vernon Smith | publisher =[[The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] | date = 17 December 2002 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/ecoadv02.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some models have begun to include [[bounded rationality]] and [[risk aversion]], such as [[prospect theory]], there still remains to be seen a unified model that can make useful predictions that incorporates the entirety of cognitive biases and rational limitations in most humans.&lt;ref name=Machina&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Machina |  first = Mark | title = Choice under Uncertainty: Problems Solved and Unsolved | journal =[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–154 | year = 1987 | url = http://dss.ucsd.edu/~mmachina/papers/Machina_Problems_Paper.pdf | doi=10.1257/jep.1.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there even exists debate as to whether it is necessary to incorporate such psychological limitations into economic models. While some economists insist they are necessary to fully appreciate the complexity of the market, others still contend that a model that incorporates human biases is either unrealistic or question its usefulness arguing that a model that doesn't approximate agents as being perfectly rational, with the possibility of minimal exceptions, is unlikely to be successful.&lt;ref name=Machina /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Krugman | first = Paul | author-link = Paul Krugman | title = How Did Economists Get It So Wrong? | newspaper =[[The New York Times]] | date = 2 September 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial economics==
{{main|Financial economics}}
* '''[[Equity premium puzzle]]''': The equity premium puzzle is thought to be one of the most important outstanding questions in neoclassical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2005/09/new_research_on.html|title=Has Barro solved the equity premium puzzle?|work=[[New Economist]] weblog|date=2005-09-29|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is founded on the basis that over the last one hundred years or so the average real return to stocks in the US has been substantially higher than that of bonds. The puzzle lies in explaining the causes behind this equity premium. While there are a number of different theories regarding the puzzle, there still exists no definitive agreement on its cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=34|date=March 1996|pages=42&amp;ndash;71|title=The Equity Premium: It’s Still a Puzzle|author=Narayana R. Kocherlakota|author-link=Narayana R. Kocherlakota| url=http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/kdsalyer/LECTURES/Ecn200e/Kocherla.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Dividend puzzle]]''': The dividend puzzle is the empirically observed phenomenon that companies that pay [[dividend]]s tend to be rewarded by [[investor]]s with higher [[Valuation (finance)|valuations]]. At present, there is no explanation widely accepted by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Borges | first = Maria Rosa | title = Is The Dividend Puzzle Solved ? | date = July 2008 | url = http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~depeco/wp/wp382008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Prast | first = Henriette | title = Investor psychology: a behavioral explanation of six finance puzzles | date = March 2004 | url = http://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/Research%20Series%20Supervision%20no%2064_tcm47-146072.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bernheim | first = B. Douglas | title = Tax Policy and the Dividend Puzzle | journal =[[RAND Journal of Economics]] | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 455–476 | year = 1991 | doi=10.2307/2600982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modigliani-Miller theorem]] suggests that the puzzle can (only) be explained by some combination of taxes, bankruptcy costs, market inefficiency (including that due to [[Behavioral economics|investor psychology]]), and [[Information asymmetry|asymmetric information]].
*'''Improved [[Black–Scholes]] and [[binomial options pricing model]]s''': The Black–Scholes model and the more general binomial options pricing models are a collection of equations that seek to model and price [[Private equity|equity]] and [[call option]]s. While the models are widely used, they have many significant limitations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2008/4/29/Science-in-Finance-IX-In-defence-of-Black-Scholes-and-Merton&lt;/ref&gt; Chief among them are the model's inability to account for historical market movements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Baggett | first = L. Scott | last2 = Thompson | first2 = James | last3 = Williams | first3 = Edward | last4 = Wojciechowski | first4 = William | title = Nobels for nonsense | journal =[[Journal of Post Keynesian Economics]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–18 |date=October 2006 | doi=10.2753/pke0160-3477290101}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their frequent overpricing of options, with the overpricing increasing with the time to maturity.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hull | first = John | last2 = White | first2 = Alan | title = The Pricing of Options on Assets with Stochastic Volatilities | journal =[[Journal of Finance]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 281–300 |date=June 1987 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1987.tb02568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of a model that can properly account for the pricing of call options on an asset with [[stochastic volatility]] is considered an open problem in financial economics.
*'''Problems with the [[Option style|American option]]''': Is there a closed form for American [[Put option|put options]]? Is there a forward [[partial differential equation]] for the American Option in a [[local volatility]] model?

==International economics==
{{main|International economics}}
* '''[[Home bias in trade puzzle]]''': The home bias in trade puzzle is an empirical observation that even when factors such as economic size of trading partners and the distance between them are considered, trade between regions within a given country is substantially greater than trade between regions in different countries, even when there are no substantial legal barriers. There is currently no framework to explain this observation.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle&gt;{{Citation | last= Obstfeld  | first= Maurice |author1-link=Maurice Obstfeld| last2= Rogoff | first2= Kenneth|author2-link=Kenneth Rogoff| year= 2000| editor-last= Bernanke | editor-first= Ben | editor-link=Ben Bernanke| editor2-last= Rogoff | editor2-first= Kenneth | contribution= The Six Major Puzzles in International Macroeconomics: Is There a Common Cause? | title=NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2000 | volume = 15 | pages = 339–390 | publisher=[[The MIT Press]] | isbn = 0-262-02503-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Edmond|first = Chris|url = http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~cedmond/632/N8A.PDF|title = Note 8a from course 316–632 "International Monetary Economics"|type = Handout}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Feldstein–Horioka puzzle]]''': The Feldstein-Horioka puzzle originates from an article in the 1980s that found that among [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries, averages of long-term national savings rates are highly correlated with similar averages of domestic investment rates. Standard economic theory suggests that in relatively open international financial markets, the savings of any country would flow to countries with the most productive investment opportunities; hence, saving rates and domestic investment rates would be uncorrelated, contrary to the empirical evidence suggested by [[Martin Feldstein]] and [[Charles Horioka]]. While numerous articles regarding the puzzle have been published, none of the explanations put forth have adequate empirical support.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle/&gt;
*'''PPP Puzzle''': The PPP puzzle, considered one of the two [[real exchange rate puzzles]], concerns the observation that [[real exchange rate]]s are both more [[Volatility (finance)|volatile]] and more persistent than most models would suggest. The only clear way to understand this volatility would be to assign substantial roles to monetary and financial [[Shock (economics)|shocks]]. However, if shocks play such a large role the challenge becomes finding what source, if one even exists, of [[nominal rigidity]] that could be so persistent to explain the long-term prolonged nature of real exchange rate deviations.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle/&gt;
*'''The exchange rate disconnect puzzle''': The exchange rate disconnect puzzle, also one of the so-called real exchange rate puzzles, concerns the weak short-term feedback link between exchange rates and the rest of the economy. In most economies, the exchange rate is the most important relative price, so it is surprising, and thus far unexplained entirely, that the correlations are not stronger.&lt;ref name=ObsfeldPuzzle/&gt;

[[Image:Pigeons-in-holes.jpg|thumb|The inspiration for the name: [[racing pigeon]]s being held in compartments]]

A '''pigeon-hole messagebox''' (commonly referred to as a ''pigeon-hole'' or ''pidge'', a ''[[cubbyhole]]'' (often shortened to "cubby") or simply as a ''mailbox'' in some academic or office settings) is an [[internal mail]] system commonly used for [[communication]] in organisations, workplaces and [[educational institute]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries. Documents and messages are placed in a person's pigeon-hole for them to collect; they can reply by putting a response inside the sender's pigeon-hole.

In medieval times pigeons were kept as domestic birds, not for racing but for their meat. Pigeon holes were the openings set in a wall or a purpose-built pigeon cote in which the birds nested. By 1789, the arrangement of compartments in writing cabinets and offices used to sort and file documents had come to be known as pigeon holes because of their resemblance to the pigeon cote. By the mid 19th century, pigeon hole was being used as a verb meaning either to put a matter to one side with the intention of coming back to it later, or to classify information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsp.htm|title=Expressions &amp; Sayings|work=tinyonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigeon hole mail boxes are used by postal offices in the United Kingdom, as they allow for easy categorising of mail for later preparation of items ready for despatch. Boxes are grouped in postcode areas with identification tabs usually fixed onto the top-left hand corner of the box allowing for easy entry and retrieval of items. Pigeon hole mail boxes can be mounted upon caster feet allowing for rearrangement of boxes to meet current processing demands.

Cubbies are also used in [[United States|American]] [[preschool]]s and [[kindergarten]]s as places to store [[backpacks]], [[lunchbox]]es, and [[jacket]]s.

In large organisations the [[mailboy]] delivers mail to departmental pigeon holes from the [[postroom]] (UK) or [[mailroom]] (US).

'''Plushophilia''' (from "[[Stuffed toy|plushie]]" and "[[-phil-|-philia]]") is a [[paraphilia]] involving [[stuffed animals]]. Most plushophiles modify their [[plushies]] with a hole or holes reminiscent of those found in sex toys, to allow them to sexually interact with their plushies. Plushophiles are sometimes called ''plushies'', although this term (plushies) can also refer to non-sexual stuffed animal enthusiasts, and to stuffed animals in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Hill|first = Dave|title = Cuddle Time|newspaper = [[Salon.com]]|date = 2000-06-19|url =  http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/06/19/plushies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/04/news/cl-6207 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Once Seen as Taboos, Sexual Fetishes Are Gaining Acceptance | first=Kathleen | last=Kelleher | date=2001-06-04 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular plushies for plushophiles==
*[[Ponies]] – a plush in a pony form, a cartoon from [[My Little Pony]].
*[[Wolf]] – a plush in a wolf form.
*[[Jaguar]] – a plush in a jaguar form.
*[[Tiger]] – a plush in a tiger form.
*[[Bears]] – a large plush in a bear form.

== Furry fandom ==
Plushophilia is sometimes assumed to be a practice common within [[furry fandom]], due in part to a 2001 article by ''Vanity Fair'' that linked various members of the furry community with plushophilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Malisow |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-12-18/news/wild-kingdom/ |title=Wild Kingdom |publisher=Houston Press |date=2003-12-18 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/041201/cover.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830043412/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/041201/cover.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 30, 2002 |accessdate=November 15, 2009 |df= |title=Montreal's furries and furverts defend their unusual lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kates |first=Tasha |url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-07-08/cb2.shtml |title=Animal Magnetism |publisher=Citypaper.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713170850/http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-07-08/cb2.shtml |archivedate=2015-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pittsburgh_city"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1998 survey of 360 members of the furry community suggested less than one percent (that is, fewer than four people) attested to being plushophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visi.com/~phantos/furrysoc.html |title=The Darken Hollow - Thoughts - Furry Sociology |publisher=Visi.com |date=2002-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015191107/http://www.visi.com/~phantos/furrysoc.html |archivedate=2006-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography and sexual activity involving [[anthropomorphism|animal anthropomorphism]] (including plushophilia and paraphilias involving [[fursuit]]s and [[cartoon animal]]s) is known in the furry fandom community as "[[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|yiff]]" (and sexual acts as "yiffing").&lt;ref name="pittsburgh_city"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8355287.stm | work=BBC News | title=Who are the furries? | date=2009-11-13 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Being in another form ==
[[Anne Lawrence]] has proposed that sexual arousal that depends upon imagining one's self as plush or "representations of anthropomorphic animal characters in [[animated cartoon]]s" be termed '''autoplushophilia'''.&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An under appreciated paraphilic dimension. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Paraphilic interests that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11233">A '''public viewing area''' is a space set aside for members of the public to safely view sites of interest, such as [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[construction site]]s or other facilities.  Sometimes they are known as [[visitor center]]s or '''interpretive sites'''.

In locations that have inherent dangers and would not normally be accessible to the public, viewing areas provide a way to satiate the public curiosity without exposing inordinate risk.  Many sites contain descriptive signs, viewing pavilions, picnic facilities, toilets, radio receivers and brochures.

== Examples ==

=== Airports ===
*[[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]] (KAUS), Family Viewing Area is located near the State Aircraft Pooling Board (fancy talk for where aircraft belonging to the State of Texas gets maintained and stored) at the end of Golf Course Road. and faces west to runway 17L/35R.

=== Railroads ===
*[[Rochelle, Illinois]], has built a public viewing area at the crossing of the [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF]] railroads there, complete with an elevated shelter, parking lot, gift shop, toilet facilities and BBQ grills.  They pipe in railroad radio audio on 106.9&amp;nbsp;MHz so visitors can listen to the radio traffic on [[Receiver (radio)|FM radios]].  ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine also sponsors a [[webcam]] to allow viewing of via the Internet.
*[[Folkston, Georgia]] has a small but well-appointed viewing area, overlooking the "Folkston Funnel", a stretch of track where two [[CSX]] lines have combined for a large amount of rail traffic. The shelter itself has some chairs, rail radio broadcasts, ample parking and electrical outlets for charging camera batteries. The only amenity it lacks is a restroom, but there is a [[McDonald's]] within a block that is [[railfan]] friendly. Highlights of viewing include up to 60 trains a day, including the [[auto train]] and the [[Tropicana Products|Tropicana]] juice train.
*[[Homewood, Illinois]] has built a public viewing platform at the south end of the [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] (former [[Illinois Central]]) [[Markham, Illinois|Markham]] Yard.  This location is on the east side of the tracks and is connected by a tunnel under the tracks to the Homewood [[Metra]] / [[Amtrak]] station.  Near the station is a static display of an [[Illinois Central|IC]] [[GP10]] and [[caboose]].  There is a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop on the other side of Harwood Avenue from the viewing platform and there are several restaurants within an easy walk in downtown Homewood.

=== Locks and dams ===
Many [[lock (water transport)|lock]] and [[dam]] facilities along the various rivers in the US have public viewing areas, including:

* [[Lock and Dam No. 15]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois]] on the [[Mississippi River]]
* [[Olmsted Locks and Dam]] in [[Olmsted, Illinois]] on the [[Ohio River]]
* [[Lock and Dam No. 12]]  in [[Bellevue, Iowa]] on the [[Mississippi River]]
* [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] near [[Lewiston, New York]], on the [[Niagara River]], has an extensive interpretive center known as the [http://niagarafallsupclose.com/american-attractions/niagara-power-vista/ Niagara Power Vista].
* [[Hoover Dam]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], on the [[Colorado River]], has an extremely large interpretive center and tour facility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/service/DamTour.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Parker Dam]] near [[Parker, Arizona]], on the [[Colorado River]], has a basic viewing area with views of the dam and interpretive signs.

=== Construction sites ===
These are, by necessity, often temporary in nature.  Harkening back to the "[[knothole]]s" in fences used by passersby to view the progress of a site, some large projects provide a glimpse into the construction by intentionally placing viewing ports in fences, often geared toward selling space in the final project.

=== Sports venues ===
Some stadiums provide locations where the public can view games in progress without entering the stadium or paying for an admission. [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[San Francisco, California]], home of the [[San Francisco Giants]] has such an area.

'''''Race and Economics''''' is a book by [[Thomas Sowell]], in which the author analyzes the relationship between [[Race in the United States|race]] and [[Wealth in the United States|wealth]] in the United States, specifically, that of [[black race|blacks]]. The book was initially published by [[David McKay Company]] in January 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Race-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/067930262X|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|title=Race and Economics, Paperback|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
He makes three basic arguments. First, he examines the economic impact of [[slavery]], in the United States, the [[West Indies]], and elsewhere. He distinguishes rural slavery from urban slavery, and circumstances in which blacks so predominated that many economic tasks fell to them of necessity, from circumstances in which blacks were punished for initiative and the development of skills.

Next, he compares the economic skills, circumstances, and successes of [[African American|American blacks]], other blacks, [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]], [[Chicano]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italian people|Italians]], [[Scot]]s, and other [[ethnic group]]s. He notes statistical quirks; ''e.g.'', comparisons of per capita income need to be checked against the median age of the groups concerned. The median age of [[Russians]] in the U.S. at the time of the book's publishing (1975) was 47, of the Irish 36, of blacks 23, of Puerto Ricans, 18. Income tends to be higher in higher age cohorts; and unemployment tends to be higher in lower cohorts. If one matches age cohort to age cohort—those in their twenties, in their thirties, in their forties, etc., comparisons are considerably more just.

He also argues that the stark comparisons between "[[White race|whites]]" and "blacks" are misleading.

His third argument criticizes past governmental and economic policies, and opens up questions for the future. He has criticisms to make of [[Liberalism|liberals]], [[Extremism|radicals]], and [[conservatism|conservatives]], each of whom, he finds, protect their favorite illusions with respect to blacks.

''Race and Economics'' greatly influenced [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foskett|first=Ken|title=Judging Thomas: The Life and Times of Clarence Thomas|year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-052722-6|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfuE_obMwxkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16319">'''Realistic conflict theory''' (initialized '''RCT'''), also known as '''realistic group conflict theory''' (initialized '''RGCT'''),&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] model of [[group conflict|intergroup conflict]].&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] toward the [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] that accompany the intergroup hostility.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=W&amp;K /&gt; Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived [[scarcity]] of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; 

Feelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a [[zero-sum game|zero-sums fate]], in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the "winning" group achieving the limited resource first).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;  The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if [[superordinate goals]] are in place.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

== Concept ==

=== History ===
The theory was officially named by [[Donald T. Campbell|Donald Campbell]], but has been articulated by others since the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;  In the 1960s, this theory developed from Campbell's recognition of social psychologists' tendency to reduce all human behavior to [[hedonism|hedonistic goals]]. He criticized psychologists like [[John Thibaut]], [[Harold Kelley]], and [[George C. Homans|George Homans]], who emphasized theories that place food, sex, and pain avoidance as central to all human processes. According to Campbell, hedonistic assumptions do not adequately explain intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Campbell believed that these [[social exchange theory|social exchange theorists]] oversimplified human behavior by likening interpersonal interaction to animal behavior.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Similar to the ideas of Campbell, other researchers also began recognizing a problem in the psychological understanding of intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;  These researchers noted that prior to Campbell, social exchange theorists ignored the essence of social psychology and the importance of interchanges between groups.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt; To the contrary of prior theories, RCT takes into account the sources of conflict between groups,  which include, incompatible goals and competition over limited resources.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

===Supportive research===

==== Robbers cave study ====

The 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment by [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Wood Sherif]] represents one of the most widely known demonstrations of RCT.&lt;ref name="W&amp;K"/&gt; The Sherifs' study was conducted over three weeks in a 200-acre summer camp in [[Robbers Cave State Park]], [[Oklahoma]], focusing on intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; In this study, researchers posed as camp personnel, observing 22 eleven- and twelve-year-old boys who had never previously met and had comparable backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The experiment was divided into three stages. The first stage being "[[ingroup]] formation", in which upon arrival the boys were split into two approximately equal groups based on similarities. Each group was unaware of the other group's presence. The second stage was the "friction phase", wherein the groups were entered in competition with one another in various camp games.  Valued prizes were awarded to the winners. This caused both groups to develop negative attitudes and behaviors towards the [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]. The third and final stage was the "integration stage". During this stage, tensions between the groups were reduced through teamwork-driven tasks that required intergroup cooperation.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The Sherifs made several conclusions based on the three-stage Robbers Cave Experiment.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; From the study, he determined that because the groups were created to be approximately equal, individual differences are not necessary or responsible for intergroup conflict to occur.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; As seen in the study when the boys were competing in camp games for valued prizes, Sherif noted that hostile and aggressive attitudes toward an outgroup arise when groups compete for resources that only one group can attain.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Sherif also establishes that contact with an outgroup is insufficient, by itself, to reduce negative attitudes.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Finally, he concludes that friction between groups can be reduced along with positive intergroup relations maintained, only in the presence of superordinate goals that promote united, cooperative action.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

However a further review of the Robber's Cave Experiments, which were in fact a series of three separate experiments carried out by the Sherifs and colleagues reveals additional deliberations. In two earlier studies the boys ganged up on a common enemy, and in fact on occasion ganged up on the experimenters themselves showing an awareness of being manipulated.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt; In addition, Michael Billig argues that in addition to the two groups of boys, the experimenters themselves form a third group, and one that is arguably the most powerful of the three and that they in fact become the outgroup themselves in the aforementioned experiment.&lt;ref name="Billig" /&gt; 

[[Lutfy Diab]] repeated the experiment with 18 boys from Beirut. The 'Blue Ghost' and 'Red Genies' groups each contained 5 Christians and 4 Muslims. Fighting soon broke out, not Christian vs Muslim but Blue vs Red. &lt;ref&gt; Us and Them, [[David Berreby]], Hutchinson 2006, p178 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions and applications ==

===Implications for diversity and integration===
RCT offers an explanation for negative attitudes toward [[racial integration]] and efforts to promote diversity.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; This is illustrated in the data collected from the [[American National Election Studies|Michigan National Election Studies]] survey. According to the survey, most whites held negative attitudes toward school districts' attempts to integrate schools via [[Desegregation busing in the United States|school busing in the 1970s]].  In these surveys, there was a general perceived threat that whites had of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; It can be concluded that, contempt towards racial integration was due to a perception of blacks as a danger to valued lifestyles, goals, and resources, rather than [[symbolic racism]] or prejudice attitudes formulated during childhood.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bobo /&gt;

RCT can also provide an explanation for why competition over limited resources in communities can present potentially harmful consequences in establishing successful [[Diversity (business)|organizational diversity]].&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt; In the workplace, this is depicted by the concept that increased racial [[heterogeneity]] among employees is associated with job dissatisfaction among majority members.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsui"/&gt; Since organizations are affixed in the communities to which their employees belong, the racial makeup of employees' communities affect attitudes toward diversity in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; As racial heterogeneity increases in a white community, white employees are less accepting of workplace diversity.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt; RCT provides an explanation of this pattern because in communities of mixed races, members of minority groups are seen as competing for economic security, power, and prestige with the majority group.

RCT can help explain discrimination against different ethnic and racial groups.&lt;ref name="Esses"/&gt; An example of this is shown in [[cross-cultural studies]] that determined that violence between different groups escalates in relationship to shortages in resources.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;  When a group have a notion that resources are limited and only available for possession by one group, this leads to attempts to remove the source of competition.&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt; Groups can attempt to remove their competition by increasing their groups capabilities (e.g. skill training), decreasing the abilities of the outgroups competition (e.g. expressing negative attitudes or applying punitive [[tariffs]]), or by decreasing proximity to the outgroup (e.g. denying immigrant access).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;

===An extension to unequal groups===
Realistic conflict theory originally only described the results of competition between two groups of equal status.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duckitt"/&gt; John Duckitt suggests that the theory be expanded to include competition between groups of unequal status. To demonstrate this, Duckitt created a scheme of types of realistic conflict with groups of unequal status and their resulting correlation with prejudice.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt;

Duckitt concluded that there are at least two types of conflict based on ingroups competition with an outgroup.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The first is 'competition with an equal group' and is explained by realistic conflict theory.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; Thus being, group-based threat that leads ingroup members to feel hostile towards the outgroup which can lead to conflict as the ingroup focuses on acquiring the threatened resource.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The second type of conflict is 'domination of the outgroup by the ingroup'. This occurs when the ingroup and outgroup do not have equal status. If domination occurs, there are two responses the subordinate group may have. One is stable oppression, in which the subordinate group accepts the dominating group's attitudes on some focal issue and sometimes, the dominant group's deeper values to avoid further conflict. The second response that may occur is unstable oppression. This occurs when the subordinate group rejects the lower status forced upon them, and sees the dominating group as oppressive. The dominant group then may view the subordinates' challenge as either justified or unjustified. If it is seen as unjustified, the dominant group will likely respond to the subordinates' rebellion with hostility. If the subordinates' rebellion is viewed as justified, the subordinates are given the power to demand change.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; An example of this would be the eventual recognition of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prejudice"/&gt;

===An extension to nations===
When group conflict extends to nations or tribes, regality theory argues that the collective danger leads citizens to start having strong feelings of national or tribal identity, preferring strong, hierarchical political system, adopting strict discipline and punishment of deviants, and expressing xenophobia and strict religious and sexual morality&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38125">The study of '''religion and video games''' is a subfield of [[Religion and the Internet|digital religion]], which the American scholar of communication, [[Heidi Campbell]], defines as "Religion that is constituted in new ways through digital media and cultures." (Campbell, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Heidi|title=Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415676113|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games once struggled for legitimacy as a cultural product, today, however, they are both business and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast

==Defining religion and religious elements==

[[Religion]] has several definitions. [[Organized religion|Religions]] that are [[Religious organization|organized]] can be seen as [[cultural system]]s, with corresponding [[religious behaviour|behavior]] and practice. They often have [[sacred text]]s and [[holy places]]. A [[religious experience]], however, does not necessarily have to be understood through an established religious framework.

Themes and questions about life and death, innocence and guilt and violence are [[Existentialism|existential]] in nature; while they are not immediately understood as "religious", they are about the [[meaning of life]].

==Use of religious elements==

[[Video game developer]]s use religious and spiritual themes to involve the player more deeply in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Testa |first=Alessandro |date= |title= Religion(s) in Videogames Historical and Anthropological Observations |url=http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/issue/view/1449/showToc |journal= Online - Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet |publisher= |volume= 05 |issue= Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective and Interdisciplinary Approaches|pages= 249–276|doi= 10.11588/rel.2014.0.12170 |access-date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game developer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who used to play outside as a child, used his experiences and memories of exploring the forest and discovering a Buddhist temple in the design of his video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/master-of-play |title= Master of Play |last1= Paumgarten |first1=Nick |date=2010-12-20 |website= [[The New Yorker]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian developer [[BioWare]] (''[[Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Dragon Age]]'') has in its offices several encyclopedias on religion, as well as the [[Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="Bissell"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bissell |first= Tom|authorlink=Tom Bissell|date= 2010|title= [[Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter]] |publisher= Pantheon Books|page=120 |isbn=978-0-307-37870-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative portrayal of religions has been criticized.&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt;

Religious elements are used in two ways: explicit and implicit. They are seen side-by-side in video games and do not exclude each other.&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Terry Ray |last2= Clanton | first2 = Dan W. |date= 2012 |title= Understanding Religion and Popular Culture: Theories, Themes, Products and Practices|publisher= [[Routledge]]|page= 130 |isbn= 9780415781060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion in ''Mass Effect'', for instance, can be understood as an "[[unseen character]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Irizarry, J.A. &amp; Irizarry, I.T. The Lord is My Shepard: Confronting Religion in the Mass Effect Trilogy. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explicit narrative references===
An explicit reference to a religious or spiritual concept is one that is clear to what it is referring.&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; These can be based upon real-world religions, but also on fictional ones. Stories, [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] and names of characters from [[religious text]]s are used as reference points.

====Ancient religions====
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture}}
Ancient religions and their deities are used in various ways. The religions portrayed are often no longer practiced, like [[ancient Greek religion]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt; In the real-time strategy game ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the player has to choose a "major god", which gives certain gameplay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-age-of-mythology-extended-edition-review |title=Age of Mythology: Extended Edition review |date=9 May 2014 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' the nameless Prince has to fight [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], an evil deity from [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Crecente, B. |year=2008 |title=Prince of Persia Ditches Roots, Gets a Final Fantasy Make-Over, |accessdate=18 September 2015|url= http://kotaku.com/5011425/prince-of-persia-ditches-roots-gets-a-final-fantasy-make-over}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Events and places====
Real world historical religions and events are used as inspiration for video games. For instance, while ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2007) is [[historical fiction|fictional]], it is set during the [[Third Crusade]] in the [[Holy Land]]; the player takes on the role of the [[Assassins|Assassin]] [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] and is involved in the conflict between Catholic Christians, Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shi'ite Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=LeJacq, Y. |year=2014 |title=Assassin's Creed Can Actually Teach You A Thing Or Two |url= http://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-can-actually-teach-you-a-thing-or-two-1576446550 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these religions appear, they are portrayed in a "sanitized manner".&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5509058/religion-in-games-less-a-leap-of-faith-more-a-suspension-of-belief |title= Religion in Games: Less a Leap of Faith, More a Suspension of Belief |last= Good |first= Owen |date= 2010-04-04 |website= [[Kotaku]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organizations====
Religion is often institutionalized, having a certain organisational structure. Most games in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series involve a religion, or a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5883361/the-rules-of-religion-and-why-the-next-one-just-might-be-a-game |title=The Rules of Religion, and Why The Next One Just Might Be a Game |first=Patricia |last=Hernandez |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious violence====
In the action role-playing game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011) a civil war is about to erupt between the Empire and the Stormcloaks.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Thames, R. C. Religion as a Resource in Digital Games. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Stormcloaks wish to worship Talos, a human ascended to godhood. The Empire suffered a defeat against the powerful Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance of Elves who have made the worship of Talos illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/what-happened-between-oblivion-skyrim-a-brief-history/2/ |title=What happened between Oblivion and Skyrim? Here's a brief history |first=Matt |last=Boyd |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is up to the player to help in the conflict.

===Implicit narrative references===
[[Image:Triforce.svg|thumb|right|175px|The [[Triforce]] from [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. Based upon the concept of [[Mon (badge)|''mon'']], it is a recognizable symbol for the series]]
The stories of [[action-adventure]] and [[Role-playing video games|role-playing]] games often involve world-saving quests. The player, as the protagonist, takes on the role of the hero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane McGonigal|McGonigal, J]] (2011). ''Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better''. Maven Publishing, Amsterdam. Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The player character is often destined to save the world, which in itself is a [[prophecy]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/video-game-religions-or-lack-thereof |title=Video Game Religions (or Lack Thereof) |first=Gil |last=Almogi |accessdate=2016-04-21 |date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, A. ''Prophecy, Pre-destination, and Free-from Gameplay The Nerevarine Prophecy in Bethesda's 'Morrowind'". In Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T. and Wysocki, J. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games Reloaded. Immersion into the Field''. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' uses religious elements and motifs like the [[Triforce]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games as a religious medium==

Players and developers use games to express their existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2013/01/22/can-we-finally-begin-to-consider-video-games-experiences/|title=It's time we consider video games as ‘experiences,’ not mere products|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Jenova Chen]] said that "I feel that ''Journey'' is a very spiritual game. People from around the world ask me if the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with ''Journey''—this is because many religions partly share a common structure". Chen said ''Journey'' is based upon [[Joseph Campbell]]'s book on comparative mythology ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' and the [[Monomyth|"Hero's Journey"]] narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/religion-friendship-and-emotion-a-journey-post-mortem/1100-6367138/|title=Religion, friendship, and emotion: A Journey post-mortem|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/180290-journey-as-ritual/|title='Journey' As Ritual|work=[[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Leonard Nimoy]], ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' added two statues in his honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/06/leonard-nimoy-memorials-added-to-star-trek-online?%20|title=Leonard Nimoy Memorials Added to Star Trek Online|first=Luke|last=Karmali|date=6 March 2015|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' added a [[non-player character]] (NPC) based upon [[Robin Williams]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/robin-williams-to-be-memorialized-in-wow|title=Robin Williams to Be Memorialized in WoW|first=David|last=Witmer|date=12 August 2014|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/apparent-robin-williams-model-found-in-world-of-warcraft/|title=Apparent Robin Williams Models Found In World Of Warcraft|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Gearbox Software]] honored a late fan of ''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]'', cancer victim Michael John Mamaril, by adding a NPC named after him in [[Borderlands 2|the sequel]]. Additionally, Gearbox posted a eulogy to Mamaril in the voice of the game character Claptrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/gearbox-to-honor-late-fan-as-an-npc-in-borderlands-2-215160.phtml|title=Gearbox to honor late fan as an NPC in Borderlands 2|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|first=Tony|last=Ponce|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their game ''[[MechWarrior Online]]'', developer [[Piranha Games]] sold a custom in-game unit called a Jenner, honoring the daughter of a player of the game. [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]122,210 was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/online-gamers-donate-122-210-in-memory-of-5-year-old-1.1302334|title=Online gamers donate $122,210 in memory of 5-year-old|date=23 August 2013|work=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losing his wife Pauline to ovarian cancer, ''[[Minecraft]]'' player "GasBandit" built a memorial for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/5-Touching-Memorials-Video-Games-70528-p2.html|title=5 Touching Memorials In Video Games|work=Cinema Blend|publisher=Gateway Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players of the online game ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' heard that fellow gamer "Codex Vahla" was in the hospital on life support, they held a digital [[wake (ceremony)|wake]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, M. "FFXIV Community Holds Massive Vigil For A Dying Player" (2014), Retrieved 14 September 2015 on http://kotaku.com/ffxiv-community-holds-massive-vigil-for-a-dying-player-1673823454&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious video games===
{{see also|Christian video game|Islamic Fun}}
Some religious groups use video games for education. An example is the Christian game ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]''.
{{Clear}}

===Use of video games in a religious setting===
In May 2012, the [[Exeter Cathedral]] used ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'' during its Sunday service.&lt;ref&gt;Narcisse, E. (2012) A PlayStation 3 Game Will Be Part of a Church Service This Sunday, Retrieved 15 september 2015 on http://kotaku.com/5909361/this-sunday-video-games-go-to-church&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/9/3010257/exeter-cathedral-flower-service|title=UK cathedral to use 'Flower' video game as part of upcoming service|first=Andrew|last=Webster|date=9 May 2012|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{See also|Video game controversy}}
Opinions on video games differ from religion and denomination; there are religious groups that use games actively to convert people, while some games are [[List of banned video games|banned]] for religious reasons. Scholars of religious studies are also studying video games, by looking at the game and to the players and their experiences, with games like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]''  Religion is considered a serious real world topic, while video games are an art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt; As such, developers and publishers sometimes take precaution not to offend people's religious beliefs. Religious references in the Japanese role-playing video game series ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' were originally censored for the U.S. release of the games. It was after the franchise switched to Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) that the religious references were left largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, A. The Religions Behind Final Fantasy. History of Computer Game Design: Technology, Culture, and Business March 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft's ''Assassin's Creed'' series show a disclaimer: {{blockquote| "Inspired by historical events and characters. This work of fiction was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt;{{efn|In ''[[Assassin's Creed: Syndicate]]'', the words "sexual orientations and gender identities" were added.}}}}

Despite efforts from some companies, there have been incidents with religious groups and video games. The German video game rating board [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] gave ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' a 16+ rating, considering it "[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/182380/postmortem_mcmillen_and_himsls_.php?print=1 |title=Postmortem: McMillen and Himsl's ''The Binding of Isaac'' |last=McMillen |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund McMillen |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' is heavily based on the notion of [[American exceptionalism]] at the turn of the 19th century, and incorporates notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of [[baptism]]. One developer on [[Irrational Games]] staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to with the developer to recast the baptism aspect as a notion of forgiveness rather than a religious tenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | title = Bioshock Infinite altered after "conversations with religious people on the team" says Levine | first = Leon | last = Hurley | date = January 18, 2013 | accessdate = January 20, 2013 | work = [[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122031459/http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | archivedate = January 22, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioshock-infinites-religious-themes-led-dev-to-consider-quitting-6404620 | title = BioShock Infinite's religious themes led dev to consider quitting | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = February 28, 2013 | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/01/bioshock-infinite-artist-almost-resigned-over-antagonists-religious-views/ | title = BioShock Infinite artist almost resigned over game's depiction of religion | last = Petitte | first = Omri | date = March 1, 2013 | work= [[PC Gamer]] | accessdate= March 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="kotaku refund"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/some-dont-like-bioshocks-forced-baptism-enough-to-as-473178476 | title = Some Don't Like BioShock's Forced Baptism.

===Hinduism===
On October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that ''[[Fallout 3]]'' would not be released in India on the [[Xbox 360]] platform.&lt;ref name="Kotaku-India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5067039/fallout-3-not-coming-to-india |title=Fallout 3 Not Coming To India |publisher=Kotaku |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |first=Mike |last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fallout-3-withheld-from-india |title=Fallout 3 withheld from India |publisher=Games Industry |accessdate=2009-12-01 |first=Jason |last=Lee |date=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that [[Brahmin]] is also the name of an ancient, powerful hereditary caste of [[Hindu]] priests and religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of [[brahman (cattle)|brahman]], a type of cow that originated in India. Brahman, a breed of [[Zebu]], are revered by Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Are-Brahmin-The-Reason-For-Fallout-3-s-Cancellation-in-India-12947.html |title=Are Brahmin The Reason For Fallout 3's Cancellation in India? |publisher=Gaming Blend |accessdate=2011-09-04 |date=2008-10-22 |first=Pete |last=Haas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action game ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' was criticized by Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, for portraying the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]]. Developed and published in India by Aurona Technologies, the player controls Hanuman. "Controlling and manipulating Lord Hanuman with a joystick/button/keyboard/mouse [is] denigration", said Zed. "Lord Hanuman was not meant to be reduced to just a 'character' in a video game to solidify [a] company/product's base in the growing economy of India." He urged Sony, the publisher of the game, to pull the game. Sony's regional manager however said that ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' sold beyond their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114224/Hindu_Statesman_Criticizes_Sonys_Hanuman_Boy_Warrior.php |title=Hindu Statesman Criticizes Sony's Hanuman: Boy Warrior |website=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-20 |first=Leigh |last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5217826/indias-first-game-gets-indias-first-game-controversy |title=India's First Game Gets India's First Game Controversy |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-18 |first=Owen |last=Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india/|title=Hindus Protest PS2 Game Released in India|work=GamePolitics|date=2009-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175535/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india|archivedate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zed was also critical of the use of [[Hindu deities]] in the [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''. In response, developer [[Hi-Rez Studios]] COO Todd Harris said that ''Smite'' would still be featuring Hindu deities, possibly adding more. GameSpot asked if characters based upon Abrahamic religions would be added as well, but Harris said that "the key Abrahimic figures—Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, are not that interesting in character design or gameplay".&lt;ref&gt;Connor Sheridan on June 29, 2012, http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deity-based-moba-smite-will-not-use-jewish-christian-islamic-figures/1100-6384974/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
''[[LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' (2008) had a last-minute delay involving a licensed song in the game's soundtrack,&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{cite web| url=http://threespeech.com/blog/2008/10/littlebigplanet-scees-official-statement/|title=LittleBigPlanet – SCEE's official statement|author=Three Speech|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics to one of the licensed songs in the game included passages from the [[Qur'an]] and could therefore be offensive to [[Muslim]]s.

===Sikhism===
''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' (2002) sparked controversy due to a level featuring the killing of [[Sikh]]s within a depiction of their most holy site, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], where hundreds of Sikhs [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|were massacred in 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_2440000/2440713.stm |title=Young Sikhs force changes to Hitman 2 |publisher=[[CBBC]] |date=21 November 2002|accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An altered version of ''Silent Assassin'' was eventually released with the related material removed from the game.

==Religion and violence==
A study released by the University of Missouri stated that video games often emphasize the violent aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5888663/study-says-video-games-have-problematized-view-of-religion|title=Study Says Video Games Have 'Problematized' View of Religion|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Greg Perreault said "It doesn't appear that game developers are trying to purposefully bash organized religion in these games, I believe they are only using religion to create stimulating plot points in their story lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0227-video-games-depict-religion-as-violent-problematized-mu-study-shows/|title=Video Games Depict Religion as Violent, Problematized, MU Study Shows|publisher=MU News Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games as focus of religious studies==
{{main|Game studies}}

For many years video games were seen as mere [[entertainment]], a form of "low culture".&lt;ref&gt;Mäyrä, F. An Introduction to Game Studies (2008). SAGE Publications. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; Playing video games was seen as a form of [[escapism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was not regarded as a valid object of scientific research. To "play" games as a scholarly pursuit was thought of as "ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticalreligion.org/2013/10/21/here-be-dragons-the-quest-for-academic-credibility/|title=Here Be Dragons: the quest for academic credibility|work=The Critical Religion Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been in recent years that video games have become the object of scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J. Videogames (2012). Routledge. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the game as an object, researchers can explore religious and spiritual references. Video game research is done in two ways; the game can be studied as an [[object (philosophy)|object]], while [[actant|actor-focused]] research looks at the player.

===Game-immanent approach===
Video games, as products of human culture, can be seen and read as "[[Text (literary theory)|texts]]". They carry myths, stories and symbols of the time in which they were created.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Campbell, H. (ed.). Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds (2012). Rutledge. Page 145&lt;/ref&gt; By "reading" video games, philosophers, sociologists and theologians have the opportunity to study the religious and spiritual themes in video games.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, H. A. en Grieve, G. P. Studying Religion in Digital Gaming. A Critical Review of an Emerging Field. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches. Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done in several ways.

*by studying the design, rules and mechanics or by talking to the developers
*by watching others play (e.g. [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play videos]])
*by playing the game themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Espen Aarseth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Player-focused approach===

Video games are [[Interactivity|interactive]]; it requires input from the player to happen. While a video game developer designs the game, including its rules and story, it is up to the player to make the game "happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Luke |editor-last=Cuddy |title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |date=2008 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; As such, it is up to individual player to give [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=James |title=Videogames |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games allow the player to think, form and possibly change their own opinion about religious and spiritual matters.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Players often discuss these elements on online platforms. For instance, some players made their own version of the player character [[Commander Shepard]] of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series an atheist, while others thought of him/her{{efn|Commander Shepard can be female or male.}} as a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, T. "Are Those the Only Two Solutions?" In Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T. Wysocki, J. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games Reloaded. Immersion into the Field. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, video games also give new meaning to the concept of religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Samuel Plimsoll''' (10 February 1824 – 3 June 1898) was an English                                          politician and social reformer, now best remembered for having devised the [[Plimsoll line]] (a line on a ship's hull indicating the maximum safe draft, and therefore the minimum [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] for the vessel in various operating conditions).

==Early life==
Samuel Plimsoll was born in [[Bristol]] and soon moved to [[Whiteley Wood Hall]], [[Sheffield]], also spending part of his childhood in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith, Cumberland]].  Leaving school at an early age, he became a clerk at Rawson's Brewery, and rose to be manager.

In 1853, he attempted to become a coal merchant in London. 
He failed and was reduced to destitution. 
He himself told how for a time he lived in a common lodging for seven shillings and two pence a week.

Through this experience, he learnt to sympathise with the struggles of the poor, and when his good fortune returned, he resolved to devote his time to improving their condition.

His efforts were directed especially against what were known as "[[coffin ship (insurance)|coffin ships]]": unseaworthy and overloaded vessels, often heavily insured, in which unscrupulous owners risked the lives of their crews.

==Political career==
In 1867, Plimsoll was elected as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], and endeavoured in vain to pass a bill dealing with the subject of a safe load line on ships. The main problem was the number of powerful ship-owning MPs in Parliament.

In 1872, he published a work entitled ''Our Seamen'', which became well known throughout the country.  Accordingly, on Plimsoll's motion in 1873, a Royal Commission was appointed, and in 1875 a government bill was introduced, which Plimsoll, though regarding it as inadequate, resolved to accept.

On 22 July, the Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], announced that the bill would be dropped. Plimsoll lost his self-control, applied the term "villains" to members of the House, and shook his fist in the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]'s face.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1875/jul/22/parliament-breach-of-order-mr-plimsoll&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli moved that he be reprimanded, but on the suggestion of [[Spencer Compton Cavendish|Lord Hartington]] agreed to adjourn the matter for a week to allow Plimsoll time for thought.
[[Image:load line.jpg|thumb|right|Load Line Mark and Lines and Timber Load Line Mark and Lines for power driven merchant vessels]]
Eventually Plimsoll made an apology. Many people, however, shared his view that the bill had been stifled by the pressure of the shipowners, and popular feeling forced the government to pass a bill which in the following year was amended into the Merchant Shipping Act.
[[Image:Memorial To Samuel Plimsoll.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorial to Samuel Plimsoll on [[Victoria Embankment]], London]]
This gave stringent powers of inspection to the [[Board of Trade]], and the mark that indicates the safe limit to which a ship may be loaded became generally known as [[Waterline|Plimsoll's mark or line]].

Plimsoll was re-elected for Derby at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|general election of 1880]] by a great majority, but gave up his seat to [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Vernon Harcourt]], believing that the latter, as Home Secretary, could advance sailors' interests more effectively than any private member.

Offered a seat by 30 constituencies, Plimsoll was an unsuccessful candidate in [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885]]. He did not re-enter the house, and later became estranged from the Liberal leaders by what he regarded as their breach of faith in neglecting the question of shipping reform.

He was for some years the honorary president of the [[National Union of Seamen|National Sailors' and Firemen's Union]], and drew attention to the horrors of the cattle-ships, where animals were transported under appalling and over-crowded conditions.

==Later life==
Later, he visited the United States to try to secure the adoption of a less bitter tone towards England in the historical textbooks used in American schools. 
He died in [[Folkestone]] on 3 June 1898, and is buried in St Martin's churchyard, [[Cheriton, Kent]].

==Family==
Plimsoll married his first wife, Eliza Ann, daughter of Hugh Railton of [[Chapeltown, Sheffield|Chapeltown]], near [[Sheffield]], in 1858. In Census 1871 they were enumerated in Hastings where Eliza Ann is recorded as being blind in her right eye and deaf in her left ear. She died in Australia in 1882. There were no children by this marriage. He married his second wife, Harriet Frankish, daughter of Mr. Joseph Armitage Wade, J.P., of Hull and [[Hornsea]], in 1885. By this marriage there were six children, of whom a son, Samuel Richard Cobden Plimsoll, and two daughters survived him.{{sfn|Orme|1901}}

[[File:Samuel Plimsoll (1824-1898) RMG BHC2956.tiff|thumb|right|Posthumous portrait of Plimsoll, executed by [[Reginald Henry Campbell]] in the late 19th century]]
In 1873, the '''''Samuel Plimsoll''''', an iron hulled full-rigged merchant sailing ship, was launched at the shipyard of Walter Hood &amp; Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland for the Aberdeen White Star Line (G. Thompson &amp; Co.).  She was assigned the official British Reg. No. 65097 and the signal MKDH.  In 1899, she caught fire in the [[Thames River]] and had to be scuttled, but was refloated and repaired in 1900.  In 1902, she was severely dismasted and damaged on voyage to Port Chalmers, Australia. Towed to Sydney and subsequently to Fremantle, she was reduced to hulk status the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Merchant/Sail/S/Samuel_Plimsoll(1873).html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.pacific.net.au/~hannahhome/ships/samuelplimsoll.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821134521/http://home.pacific.net.au/~hannahhome/ships/samuelplimsoll.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Plimsoll shoe]]s were named for their similarity in appearance to the Plimsoll line on boats.

In Whitehall Garden, a Victoria Embankment garden, there is a monument to Samuel Plimsoll in front of the railings.

British writer [[Nicolette Jones]] published ''The Plimsoll Sensation'', a highly acclaimed biography – getting the idea for it from living in 1995 in Plimsoll Road in [[Finsbury Park]], north London, but knowing hardly anything about whom it was named after.

Samuel Plimsoll appears in the third series of the BBC historical television drama ''[[The Onedin Line]]'', portrayed by actor David Garfield.

'''Science and technology studies''', or '''science, technology and society''' studies (both abbreviated '''STS''') is the study of how society, politics, and culture affect [[scientific research]] and technological [[innovation]], and how these, in turn, affect [[society]], [[politics]] and [[culture]].

==History==
Like most [[interdisciplinary]] programs, STS emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields, all of which had developed an interest—typically, during the 1960s or 1970s—in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Bijker, W. E., Hughes, T. P., Pinch, T. and Douglas, D. G., ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology'', [[MIT Press]], Cambridge, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key disciplinary components of STS took shape independently, beginning in the 1960s, and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s, although [[Ludwik Fleck]]'s (1935) monograph ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' anticipated many of STS's key themes.  In the 1970s [[Elting E. Morison]] founded the STS program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), which served as a model. By 2011, 111 STS research centres and academic programs were counted worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stswiki.org/index.php?title=Worldwide_directory_of_STS_programs The STS Wiki].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key themes===

*[[History of technology]], that examines technology in its social and historical context. Starting in the 1960s, some historians questioned [[technological determinism]], a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific "natural" development.  At the same time, some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the [[history of medicine]].
* [[History and philosophy of science]] (1960s). After the publication of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well-known ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual [[paradigm]]s, programs were founded at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and elsewhere that brought [[historians of science]] and philosophers together in unified programs.
*[[Technology and society|Science, technology, and society]]. In the mid- to late-1960s, student and faculty social movements in the U.S., UK, and European universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields (such as [[women's studies]]) that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored. One such development was the rise of "science, technology, and society" programs, which are also—confusingly—known by the STS acronym. Drawn from a variety of disciplines, including [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]], scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by [[science]] and [[technology]]. Unlike scholars in [[science studies]], history of technology, or the history and philosophy of science, they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate, "[[ivory tower]]" researchers{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. As an example of the activist impulse, feminist scholars in this and other emerging STS areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of [[Women in science|women]] from science and engineering.
*Science, engineering, and public [[policy studies]] emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science, technology, and society movement:  A sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public's best interests.{{According to whom|date=November 2013}} The science, technology, and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow's science and technology, but this discipline took a different approach: It would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy. Some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies, and most of these were eventually absorbed into [[systems engineering]]. Others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches, and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science, technology, and society departments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, leading universities in the US, UK, and Europe began drawing these various components together in new, interdisciplinary programs. For example, in the 1970s, Cornell University developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology. Each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together, as well as their location within the various universities. For example, the University of Virginia's STS program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields (with particular strength in the history of technology); however, the program's teaching responsibilities—it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students—means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in [[engineering ethics]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===The "turn to technology" (and beyond)===
{{see also|Social construction of technology}}

A decisive moment in the development of STS was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science. During that decade, two works appeared ''en seriatim'' that signaled what [[Steve Woolgar]] was to call the "turn to technology": ''Social Shaping of Technology'' (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985) and ''The Social Construction of Technological Systems'' (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). MacKenzie and [[Judy Wajcman|Wajcman]] primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design. In a seminal article, [[Trevor Pinch]] and [[Wiebe Bijker]] attached all the legitimacy of the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge. This was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology.

The "turn to technology" helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging STS programs. More recently, there has been an associated turn to ecology, nature, and materiality in general, whereby the socio-technical and natural/material co-produce each other. This is especially evident in work in STS analyses of biomedicine (such as [[Carl May]], [[Annemarie Mol]], Nelly Oudshoorn, and Andrew Webster) and ecological interventions (such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Sheila Jasanoff]], [[Matthias Gross]], [[S. Lochlann Jain]], and Jens Lachmund).

==Professional associations==
The subject has several professional associations.

Founded in 1975, the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], initially provided scholarly communication facilities, including a journal (''Science, Technology, and Human Values'') and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars. The society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide. The Society for Social Studies of Science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy; scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice; and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives. Proposals have been made to add the word "technology" to the association's name, thereby reflecting its stature as the leading STS professional society, {{According to whom|but there seems to be widespread sentiment|date=November 2013}} that the name is long enough as it is.

In [[Europe]], the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easst.net/ European Association for the Study of Science and Technology].&lt;/ref&gt;  was founded in 1981 to "stimulate communication, exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology". Similarly, the [[European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology]] (ESST) researches and studies science and technology in society, in both historical and contemporary perspectives.

In Asia several STS associations exist.
In [[Japan]], the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies (JSSTS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssts.jp/content/section/14/51/ Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2001. The Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network (APSTSN)&lt;ref&gt;[http://apstsn.org/ Asia Pacific Science Technology &amp; Society Network]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily has members from Australasia, Southeast and East Asia and Oceania.

In Latin America ESOCITE (Estudios Sociales de la Ciencia y la Tecnología) is the biggest association of Science and Technology studies. The study of STS (CyT in Spanish, CTS in Portuguese) here was shaped by authors like Amílcar Herrera and Jorge Sabato y Oscar Varsavsky in Argentina, José Leite Lopes in Brazil, Miguel Wionczek in Mexico, Francisco Sagasti in Peru, Máximo Halty Carrere in Uruguay and Marcel Roche in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Kreimer, P. (2007). Estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología en América Latina: ¿para qué?, ¿ para quién? Redes, 13(26), 55–64. Retrieved from http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/907/90702603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1958, the [[Society for the History of Technology]] initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology. After the "turn to technology" in the mid-1980s, the society's well-regarded journal (''Technology and Culture'') and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests.

Less identified with STS, but also of importance to many STS scholars, are the [[History of Science Society]], the [[Philosophy of Science Association]], and the American Association for the History of Medicine.

Additionally, within the US there are significant STS-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations, including the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[National Women's Studies Association]], and the [[American Sociological Association]].

==Important concepts==
=== STS social construction ===
{{Main|Social construction of technology}}

Social constructions are human created ideas, objects, or events created by a series of choices and interactions.&lt;ref name="Science Technology and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhouse|first1=Edward|title=Science Technology and Society|date=2014|publisher=University Readers|location=San Diego|page=255|edition=1st|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs. Some examples of social construction include class, race, money, and citizenship.

The following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set, a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other. According to the article "What is Social Construction?" by Laura Flores, "Social construction work is critical of the status quo. Social constructionists about X tend to hold that:
# X need not have existed, or need not be at all as it is. X, or X as it is at present, is not determined by the nature of things; it is not inevitable
Very often they go further, and urge that:
# X is quite as bad as it is.
# We would be much better off if X were done away with, or at least radically transformed." 
In the past, there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge. Such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human's ethnicity or race (X may not be at all as it is).&lt;ref name="The Social Construction of What"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hacking|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of What?|date=1999|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard University|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England|isbn=978-0674004122|page=6|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the evolution and interaction of various social constructions within science and technology can be found in the development of both the high-wheel bicycle, or [[velocipede]], and then of the [[bicycle]].  The velocipede was widely used in the latter half of the 19th century. In the latter half of the 19th century, a social need was first recognized for a more efficient and rapid means of transportation.  Consequently, the velocipede was first developed, which was able to reach higher translational velocities than the smaller non-geared bicycles of the day, by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel. One notable trade-off was a certain decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling. This trade-off resulted in many riders getting into accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars.

The first "social construction" or progress of the velocipede caused the need for a newer "social construction" to be recognized and developed into a safer bicycle design.  Consequently, the velocipede was then developed into what is now commonly known as the "[[bicycle]]" to fit within society's newer "social construction," the newer standards of higher vehicle safety. Thus the popularity of the modern geared bicycle design came as a response to the first social construction, the original need for greater speed, which had caused the high-wheel bicycle to be designed in the first place.  The popularity of the modern geared bicycle design ultimately ended the widespread use of the velocipede itself, as eventually it was found to best accomplish the social-needs/ social-constructions of both greater speed and of greater safety.&lt;ref name="MIT Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bijker,|first1=Wiebe|title=The Social Construction of Technological System|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-52137-7|pages=28–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technoscience ===
{{Main|Technoscience}}

Technoscience is a subset of Science, Technology, and Society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology. It states that fields are linked and grow together, and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward. Both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement. Technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Lukes, Power: A Radical View (London: Macmillan, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technosocial ===
{{split section|Technosocial|date=June 2015}}

"Technological action is a social process."&lt;ref name = "Goldman, 1992"&gt;Goldman, S. (1992). No Innovation Without Representation (pp. 148-160). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt; Social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other. This includes the aspect that social, political, and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued. In other words, "technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social/political/ economic/psychological phenomena, so 'technology' includes a spectrum of artifacts, techniques, organizations, and systems."&lt;ref name = "Woodhouse, 2013"&gt;Woodhouse, E. (2013). In The Future of Technological Civilization (Revised ed., pp. 1-258).&lt;/ref&gt; Winner expands on this idea by saying "in the late twentieth century technology and society, technology and culture, technology and politics are by no means separate."&lt;ref name = "Winner, 1993"&gt;Winner, L. (1993). Artifacts/Ideas and Political Culture (pp. 283-292). Troy, New York: Rensselaer.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
* Ford Pinto&lt;ref name = "Dowie, 1997"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1977/09/pinto-madness?page=2 Dowie, M. (1977, October 1). Pinto Madness. Retrieved February 4, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; – Ford Motor Company sold and produced the Pinto during the 1970s. A flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact. The exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people. Internal documents of test results, proved Ford CEO Lee Iacocca and engineers were aware of the flaw. The company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit-driven motives, strict internal control, and competition from foreign competitors such as Volkswagen. Ford Motor Company conducted a cost-benefit analysis to determine if altering the Ford Pinto model was feasible. An analysis conducted by Ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost. Employees were also under tight control by the CEO who rushed the Pinto through production lines to increase profits. Ford finally changed after public scrutiny. Safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles.
* DDT/toxins&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – DDT was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the 1940s until its ban in the early 1970s. It was utilized during World War 2 to combat insect-borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations. People and companies soon realized other benefits of DDT for agricultural purposes. Rachel Carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment. Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of DDT to many serious illness such as cancer. Carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims.. DDT was eventually banned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance. The main cause for the removal of DDT was the public deciding that any benefits outweighed the potential health risk.
* Autopilots/computer aided tasks (CATs)&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – From a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot. Due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average, using autopilot, have been shown to be safer. Thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety, and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems.
* Cell phones&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; – Cell phone technology emerged in the early 1920s after advancements were made in radio technology. Engineers at Bell Laboratories, the research and development division of AT&amp;T discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions. The discovery by Bell Labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology. Technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area. First generation mobile phones were first created and sold by Motorola. Their phone was only intended for use in cars. Second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital. Phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers. They were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology. Technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base. Third generation technology changed the way people interact with other. Now customers had access to wifi, texting and other applications. Mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations.  Cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure. People have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens, touch capabilities, and internet accessibility.
* Internet&lt;ref name="Woodhouse, 2013" /&gt; –  The internet arose because of extensive research on ARPANET between various university, corporations, and ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), an agency of the Department of Defense. Scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other. Computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop. The internet has become a normal part of life and business, to such a degree that the United Nations views it as a basic human right. The internet is becoming larger, one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand, for example online banking. It has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits.

===Deliberative democracy===
[[Deliberative democracy]] is a reform of [[representative democracy|representative]] or [[direct democracy|direct]] democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society.  Deliberative Democracy is a tool for making decisions.  Deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to [[Aristotle’s writings]]. More recently, the term was coined by Joseph Bessette in his 1980 work ''Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government'', where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the [[United States Constitution]] with emphasis on public discussion.&lt;ref name="Bohman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohman|first1=James|title=The Coming of Age of Deliberative Democracy|journal=[[The Journal of Political Philosophy]]|date=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=400–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberative Democracy can lead to more legitimate, credible, and trustworthy outcomes.  Deliberative Democracy allows for "a wider range of public knowledge," and it has been argued that this can lead to "more socially intelligent and robust" science. One major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction.&lt;ref name="Chilvers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chilvers|first1=Jason|title=Deliberating Competence, Theoretical and Practitioners Perspectives on Effective Participatory Appraisal Practice|journal=[[Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values]]|date=March 2008|volume=33|issue=2|url=http://sth.sagepub.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ryfe, there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy:
*Rules of equality, civility, and inclusivity may prompt deliberation even when our first impulse is to avoid it.
*Stories anchor reality by organizing experience and instilling a normative commitment to civic identities and values, and function as a medium for framing discussions.
*Leadership provides important cues to individuals in deliberative settings, and can keep groups on a deliberative track when their members slip into routine and habit.
*Individuals are more likely to sustain deliberative reasoning when they have a stake in the outcomes.
*Apprenticeship teaches citizens to deliberate well. We might do well to imagine education as a form of apprenticeship learning, in which individuals learn to deliberate by doing it in concert with others more skilled in the activity.&lt;ref name="Ryfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryfe|first1=David M.|title=Does Deliberative Democracy Work?|journal=[[Annual Review of Political Science]]|date=March 4, 2005|volume=8|pages=63–64|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.8.032904.154633|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Importance of deliberative democracy in STS====
Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology. Jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology, but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology.&lt;ref name="Jasanoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jasanoff|first1=Sheila|title=Technologies of Humility: Citizen Participation in Governing Science|journal=Minerva|date=2003|volume=41|issue=3|pages=223–244 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1025557512320|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deliberative democracy in practice====
Ackerman and Fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper "Deliberation Day." The deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s Deliberative Polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Bruce|last2=Fishkin|first2=James S.|title=Deliberation Day|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/media/news/2004/03/10/586/deliberation-day/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.&lt;ref name="Bohman"/&gt;

An ideal Deliberative Democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants. While the main aim is to reach consensus, a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints, concerns due to uncertainties, and questions about assumptions made by other participants. It should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate. Independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed, but must "[remain] independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process."&lt;ref name="Chilvers"/&gt;

===Tragedy of the commons===
{{see also|Tragedy of the commons}}

In 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] popularised the phrase "tragedy of the commons." It is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource. Since then, the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource. Although Garrett Hardin was not an STS scholar, the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science, technology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardin|first1=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/sotp/pdfs/162-3859-1243.pdf|website=www.sciencemag.org|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a contemporary setting, the Internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information. Data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents. Virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidow|first1=Bill|title=The Tragedy of the Internet Commons|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tragedy-of-the-internet-commons/257290/#disqus_thread|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[net neutrality]] can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an STS context. The movement for net neutrality argues that the Internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group, specifically those with more money to spend on Internet access.

A counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by Andrew Kahrl. Privatization can be a way to deal with the tragedy of the commons. However, Kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on [[Long Island]], in an attempt to combat overuse of Long Island beaches, made the residents of Long Island more susceptible to flood damage from [[Hurricane Sandy]]. The privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape. Tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed. This attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive. Privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Matthew E.|title=Environmental and Urban Economics|url=http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-counter-example-to-tragedy-of-commons.html|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative modernity===
Alternative [[modernity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Shmuel|title=Multiple Modernities|journal=Dædalus|date=Winter 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feenberg|first1=Andrew|title=Alternative Modernity : The Technical Turn in Philosophy and Social Theory|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520089860}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society. Modernity represents the political and social structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials.

Previously, modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern, and its evolution through European colonialism. The process of becoming "modern" is believed to occur in a linear, pre-determined way, and is seen by Philip Brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations. This thought ties in with [[modernization theory]], the thought that societies progress from "pre-modern" to "modern" societies.

Within the field of science and technology, there are two main lenses with which to view modernity. The first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards. In effect, we can discuss the notion of "alternative modernity" (as described by Andrew Feenberg) and which of these we would like to move towards. Alternatively, modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals. From this perspective, alternative modernities exist simultaneously, based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society (or an individual within society) should function. Because of different types of interactions across different cultures, each culture will have a different modernity.

===Pace of innovation===
{{See also|Pace of innovation}}

Pace of Innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring, with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid. Both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology.

===No innovation without representation===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{main|No innovation without representation}}

"No innovation without representation" is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments.

* [[Langdon Winner]] states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be. It is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "Artifact/Ideas and Political Culture." Technology and the Future (1993): 283-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spoken about by [[Massimiano Bucchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucchi, Massimiano. "No Innovation without Representation (A Parliament of Things for the New Technical Democracies)." http://www.fondazionebassetti.org/. 20 Dec. 2003. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering, it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions, as talked about by [[Steven L. Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Steven L. "No Innovation Without Representation: Technological Action in a Democratic Society." New Worlds, New Technologies, New Issues (1992): 148-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileged positions of business and science===
{{POV section|date=August 2016}}
{{Main|Privileged positions of business and science}}

The privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge, ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

===Legacy thinking===

Legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual, because it is already widely accepted by society.

Legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works.  By accepting ideas without questioning them, people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical.  Legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy, who have the means to project their ideas on the public.  It may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good.
Examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society. The belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized, leading to public acceptance of corporate [[lobbying]]. As a result, a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the Constitution to the fullest extent. This can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Bill, and Sarah Harkins. "Fixed Fortunes: Biggest Corporate Political Interests Spend Billions, Get Trillions." Sunlight Foundation Blog. Sunlight Foundation, 17 Nov. 2014. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this, despite polls from Harris Interactive that report over 80% of Americans feel that big business holds too much power in government.&lt;ref&gt;Corso, Regina, SVP. "PACs, Big Companies, Lobbyists, and Banks and Financial Institutions Seen by Strong Majorities as Having Too Much Power and Influence in DC." Harris Interactive: Harris Polls. Harris Interactive, 29 May 2012. Web. 21 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought, rejecting legacy thinking, and demanding less corporate, and more public, participation in political decision making.

Additionally, an examination of [[net neutrality]] functions as a separate example of legacy thinking. Starting with [[dial-up]], the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members. They use it in and out of life every day.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"&gt;"Net Neutrality: A Free and Open Internet." The White House. The White House, 26 Feb. 2015. Web. 21 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources. Since the American public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do. Legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a &lt;!--which kind? - human right/..?--&gt;utility. Legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a &lt;!--basic?--&gt;utility. Due to pressure from grassroots movements the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility.&lt;ref name="Net Neutrality 2015"/&gt; Now AT&amp;T and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking’s grip on American&lt;!--this article &amp; legacy thinking relates to the global population not just the American--&gt; culture and politics.

For example, those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the [[water privatization|privatization of clean drinking water]] as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;Flow. Oscilloscope Pictures, 2008. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partially because access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them. For a person living in such circumstances, it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past. Additionally, a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water.

This notion can be examined through the thought experiment of "[[veil of ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, Edward. Science Technology and Society. Spring 2015 ed. N.p.: U Readers, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the "you get what you pay for" mentality applied to a life necessity. By utilizing the "veil of ignorance", one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances, allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas.

==History==
According to [[CNN]], Slide the City was founded by T.R. Gourley, John Malfatto and David Wulf in 2013, who claim that they were “inspired by their own childhood memories”&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; to create the event.

Slide the City is owned by Sack Lunch Productions, a Utah-based for-profit company.&lt;ref name=aboutslidethecity/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sack Lunch Productions (SAKL) CEO on leading edge of $20b global events market|url=http://www.stockhouse.com/opinion/interviews/2016/02/22/sack-lunch-productions-sakl-ceo-on-leading-edge-$20b-global-events-market|website=Stockhouse|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The company promotes Slide the City as an event which provides an opportunity for the sliders to go back to the old days of the 1980s, when [[backyard]] water slides were generally in demand among children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilje|first1=Shelby|title=Backyard Water Slides Prove Dangerous For Adults, Teens|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940904&amp;slug=1928693|website=The Seattle Times|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it features a larger community water slide of {{convert|1000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=theinquisitrnews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mark|first1=Jon|title=Slide The City Hopes California Is In Their Future|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2760479/slide-the-city-hopes-california-is-in-their-future/|website=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is promoted as a “family friendly slip-and-slide water party event” in the summertime.&lt;ref name=theinquisitrnews/&gt; “The main goal is just to bring [[communities]] together. We want people to have something to come and do, something that’s fun, something that builds a [[community]] up,” said [[Kurt Jackson]], the slide manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCormick|first1=Mike|title=1,000-foot water slide takes over Upstate city street|url=http://www.wyff4.com/news/slide-1000-feet-long-taking-over-upstate-city-street/33151640|website=WYFF4.com|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the official website, apart from the entertaining value that the event offers, Slide the City is also aiming at raising [[water conservation]] awareness, and providing clean water around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Conversation|url=http://www.slidethecity.com/water-conservation/|website=Slide the City|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; T R Gourley, the cofounder of Slide the City, claims to minimize water usage at their event, making minimization of environmental impact on the communities a priority concern&lt;ref name=prweb&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant Water Slide Coming to Bend|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/07/prweb12832780.htm|website=Online Press Release Distribution Service|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity partnerships==
Slide the City is described as an event that couples fun with [[fundraising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Denise|title=Giant water slide coming to Oldham town centre|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/giant-water-slide-coming-oldham-9287351|website=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the proceeds from each event will be contributed to a cause local to the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slide the City Announces 2015 World Tour|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/01/14/697392/10115560/en/Slide-the-City-Announces-2015-World-Tour.html|website=Nasdaq GlobeNewswire|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slide the City is held in various locations and there are different forms of [[charity (practice)|charity]], including [[donation]], [[fund-raising]] and free tickets giveaway. It supports [[nonprofit organization]] or charities with different nature and aspiration.

For example, Slide the City in Hong Kong supports a charity called "A Drop of Life" by donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slide the City Hong Kong - Kai Tak Cruise Terminal|url=http://slidethecity.hk/events/hong-kong/|website=Slide the City|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slide the City in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] also raised funds for the non-profit organization, "Allentown Youth Organizations United to Help".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lauer-Williams|first1=Kathy|title=Slide the City: Ride 1,000-feet-long water slide in Allentown|url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/kids/mc-slide-city-allentown-cedar-creek-20150802-story.html|website=The Morning Call|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than that, in Slide the City of [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], by typing the promotional code offered by the host when purchasing tickets, 15% of the sale will be transferred directly to the organization, "The Mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umble|first1=Chad|title=Slide the City sold 3,000 tickets, helped local charity raise $10,000 with Sunday's waterslide|url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/slide-the-city-sold-tickets-helped-local-charity-raise-with/article_88943814-2f17-11e5-9f7c-a35cffa04e49.html|website=Lancaster Online|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event has delivered 500 free single-ride tickets and raised $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nardo|first1=Melissa|title=Slide the City coming to Lancaster|url=http://fox43.com/2015/04/09/slide-the-city-coming-to-lancaster/|website=Fox 43|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the donation of Slide the City in [[Boise]] goes to "[[Ronald McDonald House Charities]] of Idaho" (RMHCI); for each volunteer who applies for a shift during the event, RMHCI will receive a $50 donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Harrison|title=Slide the City plans to turn Boise thoroughfare into a giant slip-n-slide|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/Cobweb/archives/2014/08/08/slide-the-city-plans-to-turn-boise-thoroughfare-into-a-giant-slip-n-slide|website=Boise Weekly|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There were complaints about poor organization and [[crowd control]].&lt;ref name=ejinsight/&gt; The waiting time was up to two to three hours between slides and unlimited ticketholders were only able to slide two times.&lt;ref name=ejinsight/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pittsburgh/&gt;&lt;ref name=nooga/&gt; Participants expressed their complaints that they were unable to access unlimited [[Amusement ride|ride]]s and get into the number of rides they paid for.&lt;ref name=ejinsight/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pittsburgh/&gt;

Safety issues were also raised by the public. Some participants suffered minor injuries as the slides were too steep and they were unable to slow down at the end of the slide.&lt;ref name=Pittsburgh&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Richard|title=What Did You Think of Slide The City?|url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Best-of-the-Burgh-Blogs/The-412/June-2015/What-Did-You-Think-of-Slide-The-City/|website=Pittsburgh Magazine|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at a different venue,  participants complained about the water insufficiency and the lack of gradient of the slide which resulted in people crashing into each other .&lt;ref name=ejinsight/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chan|first1=Gloria|title=Water slides 'not slippery enough to prevent crashes' at Hong Kong event, say customers who waited two hours for 20-second ride|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1852060/water-slides-not-slippery-enough-prevent-crashes-hong-kong|website=South China Morning Post|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to these complaints, The organizer claimed that a team was put together to calculate the best slide inclination in advance to future events.&lt;ref name=nooga&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phipps|first1=Sean|title=Despite criticism, Slide the City still a go|url=http://nooga.com/170168/despite-criticism-slide-the-city-still-a-go/|website=Nooga.com|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participators complained that the organizers did not prevent participants using picture-taking devices, like [[selfie stick]]s and [[action camera]]s and this may pose risks to others and cause crashes.&lt;ref name=ejinsight/&gt;

There were also environmental concerns. More than 6000 people signed an online petition to stop this event from setting up in California and thousands of people have signed a petition demanding cancellation of the event in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=news24/&gt; Those signers said that it is “extremely irresponsible” to allow an event featuring giant water slide to take place as these places were facing water shortages.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; The organizers replied by claiming that the slide will use {{convert|12,000|to|16,000|gal}} of water, and the slide was designed to recycle water throughout the day instead of pumping new water into the slide.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rocha|first1=Veronica|title=In face of drought, critics say 'Slide the City' doesn't hold water|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-slide-thecity-20140817-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news24&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancel 'wasteful' Slide the City event - petition|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/cancel-wasteful-slide-the-city-event-petition-20151109|website=News24|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2015, the water slide of Slide the City was used by The Trinity River Vision Authority to set the world record for the “longest distance travelled on a slip and slide in one hour” on Panther Island, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slide the City's giant, urban water slide coming to Tampa this spring|url=http://www.tbo.com/events-tampa-bay/slide-the-citys-giant-urban-water-slide-coming-to-tampa-this-spring-20160225/|website=www.TBO.com|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Guinness World Record]], the participants collectively travelled a distance of {{convert|774,515.09|m|ft}} in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swatman|first1=Rachel|title=Hundreds slip and slide their way to  record-breaking success in Texas|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/7/hundreds-slipnslide-their-way-to-record-breaking-success-in-texas-386849|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=|date= March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4929">{{about|the sociological concept|the mathematical term|Symbolic power of a prime ideal}}
The concept of '''symbolic power''' was first introduced by French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to account for the tacit, almost unconscious modes of cultural/social domination occurring within the everyday social habits maintained over conscious subjects. Symbolic power accounts for discipline used against another to confirm that individual's placement in a [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]], at times in individual relations but most basically through system institutions, in particular [[education]].

Also referred to as "soft [[Power (social and political)|power]]", symbolic power includes actions that have discriminatory or injurious meaning or implications, such as gender dominance and racism. Symbolic power maintains its effect through the mis-recognition of power relations situated in the social matrix of a given [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]. While symbolic power requires a dominator, it also requires the dominated to accept their position in the exchange of social value that occurs between them.

==History==
The concept of symbolic power may be seen as grounded in [[Friedrich Engels]]' concept of [[false consciousness]]. To Engels, under capitalism, objects and social relationships themselves are embedded with societal value that is dependent upon the actors who engage in interactions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Mehring|year=1893|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the illusion of natural law governing such transactions of social and physical worth, the proletariat would be unwilling to consciously support social relations that counteract their own interests. Dominant actors in a society must consciously accept that such an ideological order exists for unequal social relationships to take place. [[Louis Althusser]] further developed it in his writing on what he called Ideological State Apparatuses, arguing that the latter's power is partly based on symbolic repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Althusser, Louis|contribution=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatus|editor=Althusser, Louis|title=Lenin and Philosophy, and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1972|p=145ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of symbolic power was first introduced by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] in ''[[La Distinction]]''. Bourdieu suggested that cultural roles are more dominant than economic forces in determining how hierarchies of power are situated and reproduced across societies. Status and economic capital are both necessary to maintain dominance in a system, rather than just ownership over the means of production alone. The idea that one could possess [[symbolic capital]] in addition and set apart from financial capital played a critical role in Bourdieu's analysis of hierarchies of power.

For example, in the process of reciprocal gift exchange in the Kabyle society of Algeria, where there is asymmetry in wealth between the two parties the better endowed giver "can impose a strict relation of hierarchy and debt upon the receiver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bourdieu in Algeria: Colonial Politics, Ethnographic Practices, Theoretical Developments|author=Jane Goodman|year=2009|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=unpresssamples}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic power, therefore, is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who, once they begin observing and evaluating the world in terms of those categories—and without necessarily being aware of the change in their perspective—then perceive the existing [[social order]] as just. This, in turn, perpetuates a [[social structure]] favored by and serving the interests of those agents who are already dominant.&lt;ref name="Cattani2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cattani, Gino|author2=Ferriani, Simone|author3=Allison, Paul|year=2014|title=Insiders, Outsiders and the Struggle for Consecration in Cultural Fields: A Core-Periphery Perspective|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=79|issue=|pages=258–281|doi=10.1177/0003122414520960|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByE7rCUuloTlZm9LLW9adXRXMFE/edit?usp=sharing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic power, if real, is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes the specter of legitimacy of the social order.

'''Teen dating violence''' is the [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[psychological abuse|psychological]] / [[emotional abuse|emotional]] [[abuse]] (or [[violence]]) within a dating relationship among adolescents.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web | last = CDC | author-link = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Teen dating violence | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = June 29, 2015 | accessdate = November 15, 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) has been a well examined and documented phenomenon in adults; however, there has not been nearly as much study on violence in adolescent dating relationships, and it is therefore not as well understood. The research has mainly focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chu | first1 = Ann T. | last2 = Sundermann | first2 = Jane M. | last3 = DePrince | first3 = Anne P. | contribution = Intimate partner violence in adolescent romantic relationships | editor-last1 = Donohue | editor-first1 = William T. | editor-last2 = Benuto | editor-first2 = Lorraine T. | editor-last3 = Woodward Tolle | editor-first3 = Lauren | title = Handbook of adolescent health psychology | page = 193 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781461466338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=KX29BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimate partner violence (IPV) in adolescents is an important realm of study as, in addition to the usual negative effects of abuse, this violence occurs at a critical period in the social and mental development of a person.  This is also an important topic from a [[gender studies]] perspective as almost 32% of male adolescents engage in some form of violence, whether sexual, physical or emotional, towards their partners while adolescent violence from females is nearly half of that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bachman | first1 = Ronet | last2 = Peralta | first2 = Robert | title = The relationship between drinking and violence in an adolescent population: does gender matter? | journal = [[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]] | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1080/016396202317192008 | date = January 2002 | ref = harv }} [http://www3.uakron.edu/publications/relationshiprp.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the United States public health authority, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), "[a]dolescents and adults are often unaware that teens experience dating violence."&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==Gender differences==
{{see also|Domestic violence#Gender differences}}
The literature on IPV among adolescents indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Knox | first1 = Lyndee | last2 = Lomonaco | first2 = Carmela | last3 = Alpert | first3 = Elaine | contribution = Adolescent relationship violence | editor-last1 = Mitchell | editor-first1 = Connie | editor-last2 = Anglin | editor-first2 = Deirdre | title = Intimate partner violence: a health-based perspective | pages = 514, 516 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780199720729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q04QO7UmyowC&amp;pg=PA514 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Jessica R. | last2 = Ghandour | first2 = Reem M. | last3 = Kub | first3 = Joan E. | title = Female perpetration of violence in heterosexual intimate relationships: adolescence through adulthood | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse]] | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–249 | doi = 10.1177/1524838008324418 | pmc = 2663360 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv | pmid=18936281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard adolescent dating violence, and that this is "perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ely | first1 = Gretchen | last2 = Dulmus | first2 = Catherine N. | last3 = Wodarski | first3 = John S. | contribution = Adolescent dating violence | editor-last1 = Rapp-Paglicci | editor-first1 = Lisa A. | editor-last2 = Roberts | editor-first2 = Albert R. | editor-last3 = Wodarski | editor-first3 = John S. | title = Handbook of violence | page = 36 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780471214441 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YtOvUULaNZEC&amp;pg=PA36 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that "a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level" and that this "physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man."&lt;ref name="Rapp-Paglicci"/&gt;

Regarding studies that indicate that girls are as likely or more likely than boys to commit IPV, the authors emphasize that substantial differences exist between the genders, including that girls are significantly more likely than boys to report having experienced severe IPV, such as being threatened with a weapon, punched, strangled, beaten, burned, or raped, and are also substantially more likely than boys to need  psychological help or experience physical injuries that require medical help for the abuse, and to report sexual violence as a part of dating violence. They are also more likely to take IPV more seriously. By contrast, boys are more likely to report experiencing less severe acts, such as being pinched, slapped, scratched or kicked. Girls are more likely to report committing less serious forms of IPV, including as a means of self-defense, whereas boys are more likely to report committing more severe acts of IPV, including threats, physical violence and controlling a partner.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; That girls are more likely to engage in IPV as a result of self-defense is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{citation | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Katie M. | last2 = Dardis | first2 = Christina M. | last3 = Gidycz | first3 = Christine A. | contribution = The role of victimization experiences in adolescent girls and young women's aggression in dating relationships | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 2, Part I.

==Controversies and arguments==
There is a common misconception that aggression is stable over time. That is, young people who are labeled as or considered to be violent and aggressive at any point in time are then assumed to be dangerous for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Loeber | first1 = Rolf | last2 = Stouthamer-Loeber | first2 = Magda | title = Development of juvenile aggression and violence: some common misconceptions and controversies | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–259 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.242 | pmid = 9491750 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a contentious issue because there is a desire to protect both parties involved (or that have the potential to become involved) in teen dating violence. While classifying the perpetrator as a threat may be detrimental to his or her life and future relationships, not classifying the perpetrator this way may put future partners at risk.

There is considerable debate over whether we as a society have an accurate picture of the prevalence and severity of teen dating violence by gender. It is important to note that although male and female adolescents do not differ in "overall frequency of violence in dating relationships," females are subject to "significantly higher levels of severe violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molidor | first1 = Christian | last2 = Tolman | first2 = Richard M. | title = Gender and contextual factors in adolescent dating violence | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–194 | doi = 10.1177/1077801298004002004 | pmid = 12295440 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact begs the question of whether abuse should be evaluated based on “severity” and how that can and should be measured, or if all abuse should be considered equally harmful.

[[Age of consent]] is an issue that cannot be ignored in the discussion of teenage dating violence. Teenage sex is regulated in such a way that "age of consent laws render teenagers below a certain age incapable of consent to sexual activity with adults, and sometimes with peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sutherland | first = Kate | title = From jailbird to jailbait: age of consent laws and the construction of teenage sexualities | journal = [[William &amp; Mary Law School#Law journals|William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–349 | ssrn = 1586883 | date = Spring 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wmjwl9&amp;div=20 | ref = harv }} [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=wmjowl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the adult may be just a few months older than the minor. There are a number of states in which "age of consent statutes are used to prosecute consensual sex between two persons both under the age of consent." This type of prosecution has been deemed unconstitutional in some states by citing violation of privacy rights, but remains in effect in other states. Sexual behavior and aggression can be so deeply intertwined that the legality of underage consensual sex is sure to have an effect on teen dating violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Nature vs. nurture==
{{OR section|date=September 2015}}
Significant research has been done on the causes behind violent behavior in adolescent dating relationships with the intention of guiding the creation of dating violence prevention programs, and in turn has provided findings on the roles of nature and nurture in the development of such behavior with a strong favor towards nurture factors. A study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health examined the potential association between a spectrum of childhood adverse experiences and physical violence in relationships before age 21 for both members. The subjects were asked questions about violence in their adolescent relationships, as either victim or perpetrator, and their childhood surrounding twelve different adversities: parental death, parental divorce, long-term separation from parent, parental mental illness, parental substance abuse disorder, parental criminality, inter-parental violence, serious physical illness in childhood, physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and family economic adversity. The results demonstrated a strong positive correlation between ten out of the twelve childhood adversities and physically violent behavior in a teen relationship, with 13.8% responding with experiences of sexual violence, and 11.6% experiencing inter-parental violence. This points to a strong influence of experience, or nature, on violent tendencies in adolescent relationships. Multiple other studies corroborate these findings, citing childhood bullying, assault, and maltreatment as significant indicators for future violence in adolescent dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Elizabeth | last2 = Breslau | first2 = Joshua | last3 = Chung | first3 = W.J. Joanie | last4 = Green | first4 = Jennifer Greif | last5 = McLaughlin | first5 = Katie A. | last6 = Kessler | first6 = Ronald C. | title = Adverse childhood experiences and risk of physical violence in adolescent dating relationships | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 65 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–1013 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2009.105429 | pmid = 21321063 | date = November 2011 | ref = harv | pmc=3686487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there has been little explicit study of the relationship between nature and teen dating violence, there has been proven correlation between testosterone levels and violent tendencies that could come to fruition in adolescent dating relationships. Higher testosterone levels “manifests itself in various intensities and forms from; thoughts, anger, verbal aggressiveness, competition, dominance behavior, to physical violence.”  A study published in the International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reported, “Testosterone plays a significant role in the arousal of these behavioral manifestations in the brain centers involved in aggression and on the development of the muscular system that enables their realization. There is evidence that testosterone levels are higher in individuals with aggressive behavior, such as prisoners who have committed violent crimes.” However, the study also noted that many cases of high testosterone levels are disarmed through socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–568 | doi = 10.5812/ijem.3661 | pmc = 3693622 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv | pmid=23843821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, because children are exposed to relationships early in their life through their parents and being so malleable at a young age, most evidence points to an adverse experience or experiences in childhood as fodder for such behavior in adolescence.

==Prevalence and approaches==
The literature on IPV among adolescents primarily focuses on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Donohue"/&gt;

====Statistics====
While dating, domestic and sexual violence affect women regardless of their age, teens and young women are especially vulnerable. Young people ages 12 to 19 experience the highest rates of rape and sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Truman | first1 = Jennifer L. | last2 = Rand | first2 = Michael R. | title = Criminal victimization, 2009 | url = http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv09.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2010 }} {{NCJ|231327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people age 18 and 19 experience the highest rates of stalking. Approximately one in three adolescent girls in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner—a figure that far exceeds victimization rates for other types of violence affecting youth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Antoinette | title = Interpersonal and physical dating violence among teens | journal = The National Council on Crime and Delinquency Focus | date = September 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425153501/http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | url = http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2008_focus_teen_dating_violence.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]], former Wisconsin Representative said "if the numbers we see in domestic violence (dating violence) were applied to terrorism or gang violence, the entire country would be up in arms, and it would be the lead story on the news every night".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Savacool | first = Julia | title = Our most important mission ever: stop violence against women now | url = http://www.marieclaire.com/world-reports/news/domestic-violence-stop | work = [[Marie Claire]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | date = 10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Women's Health'', "81% of parents surveyed either believed dating violence is not an issue or admit they don't know if it's an issue",&lt;ref name=UMHS&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = Who's affected by dating violence? | journal = Women's Health | page = 3 | date = June–July 2004 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905041051/http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | archive-date = 5 September 2008 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/whp/newsletters/summer04/p03-dating.html | ref = harv }} Sources: [[Futures Without Violence|Family Violence Prevention Fund]] and [[Advocates for Youth]]&lt;/ref&gt; this is concerning because of the growth of dating abuse in teenagers relationships.&lt;ref name=UMHS /&gt; Dating violence has advanced{{Clarify|date=September 2015}} through the years by the means of communication technology.  A survey conducted by Teenage Research Unlimited stated that "[10] percent of teens have been threatened physically via e-mail, IM, text messaging, chat rooms, etc."

A 2008 [[meta-analysis]], which examined 62 [[empirical research]] studies between 1996 and 2006, relating to domestic violence in heterosexual intimate relationships from adolescence through to adulthood in the United States, reported on research findings that consistently show that adolescent females commit significantly more acts of domestic violence in intimate relationships than adolescent males. It stated, however, that the "data also suggest that females who commit acts of domestic violence may experience more violent or frequent IPV victimization than males" and that "[t]he highest rates [for female-perpetrated IPV] were found for emotional violence, followed by physical and sexual violence. Prevalence rates varied widely within each population, most likely due to methodological and sampling differences across studies." The authors added, "Few longitudinal studies existed, limiting the extent to which we could identify developmental patterns associated with female perpetrated intimate partner violence." They found a few studies which reported prevalence rates of IPV perpetration among females at two or more time points, which they stated made "it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the developmental patterns associated with this type of violence." There was also only one study that reported on prevalence rates over time for female perpetrated IPV among adolescents. "This study found a significant increase in prevalence over a six month period; however, they measured lifetime perpetration of IPV, therefore, it is unclear if there was an actual increase or simply an accumulation of violence," stated the authors. "Together, these studies provide very limited evidence that female perpetration of IPV may follow a similar developmental trajectory as other forms of violence. [...] Unfortunately, many of the studies included in this review used modified or alternative instruments making it difficult to accurately compare prevalence estimates."&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

In a 2009 survey, the CDC found that 9.8% of high school students in the U.S. reported having been intentionally physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend in the preceding 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; A 2011 CDC nationwide survey of the U.S. population reported that 23% of females and 14% of males who ever experienced rape, other physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner first experienced some form of partner violence between 11 and 17 years of age.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The ages between 16 and 24 are when youth are the most susceptible to dating violence. Also, according to the CDC, one in ten teens will be physically abused between seventh and twelfth grade. Because of this abuse, victims are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, employ precarious sexual conduct, develop eating disorders, and attempt suicide.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The above numbers are notable in their magnitude and in their discrepancy, indicating that at some point between birth and high school a huge number of males are learning that it is useful and acceptable to abuse their dating partners in some way. The reciprocal of males learning violent behaviors is that women are not learning this fact and are instead learning through our culture and through violence directed at them that they are to be submissive. Males learning violent behaviors coupled with females thinking it normative creates a cycle of women being abused, learning to accept it and imparting this idea to their children and repeating the process. According to a study conducted by Susan M. Sanders she found that many adolescents do not always view aggressive behavior as violent or abusive and roughly 77.6% young girls agreed that after a physical altercation such as being kicked by their partner that they would cease to date them. The study conducted demonstrated that many adolescents, primarily females were more susceptible to leave only after a physical altercation took place. With these studies it was found that once a physical altercation took place the victim  would then view it as abusive and eventually desire to leave the relationship.&lt;ref&gt; Susan, M. S.(2003) Teen Dating Violence: The Invisible Peril. New York. Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent dating violence is a subject which must be understood in order for true equality between the sexes to be achieved and to help stop partner violence in adults before it occurs.

====Legislation====
In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) states that "[p]olicymakers can play a role in preventing teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL&gt;{{cite web | title = Teen dating violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609073629/http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/teen-dating-violence.aspx | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | url = http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=17582 | website = ncsl.org | publisher = [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] | date = May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lists those states that currently have laws requiring school boards to develop and adopt programs to address this issue. Further, according to NCSL "[i]n 2011 at least eight states have introduced legislation to address teen dating violence".&lt;ref name=NCSL/&gt; On January 31, 2011, President Obama proclaimed February 2011 to be "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = President of the United States | author-link = President of the United States | title = Presidential proclamation--National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011 | url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/31/presidential-proclamation-national-teen-dating-violence-awareness-and-pr | website = whitehouse.gov | publisher = [[White House]] | date = 31 January 2011 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. first recognized "National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week", sponsored by Senator [[Mike Crapo]], to "increase public awareness and education of the prevalence of teen dating violence among our nation's teens".&lt;ref name=Crapo&gt;{{cite web | last = Crapo | first = Mike (Sen.) | author-link = Mike Crapo | title = Teen dating violence awareness week | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130219164115/http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | archive-date = 19 February 2013 | url = http://www.crapo.senate.gov/issues/teen_dating_violence.cfm | website = crapo.senate.gov | date = 19 February 2013 | access-date = 13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first week in February was so recognized through 2009. Beginning in 2010, Senator Crapo joined the Department of Justice in recognizing the month of February as Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.&lt;ref name=Crapo/&gt;

====National helpline and organizations====
The National Dating Abuse Helpline, created by [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]], is a 24-hour nationwide Web-based and telephone resource created to help teens and young people who are experiencing dating abuse.

'''The Connect U.S. Fund''' ('''CUSF''') was a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based nonprofit that promotes responsible U.S. global engagement in issues like [[nuclear nonproliferation]], [[human rights]], [[climate change]], and development. It was founded in 2004 by several foundations and shut down in 2013. The organization supported grantees and other non-governmental organizations in their efforts to collaborate, engage policy makers, and bring issues to the attention of the media. Its last President was [[Nancy Soderberg]].&lt;ref name=thehill&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-a-environment/120591-investments-in-climate-change-solutions-can-break-the-global-logjam "Biographical Information: Ambassador Nancy E. Soderberg"], ''The Hill'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Connect U.S. initiative was founded in 2004 by the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], [[Open Society Institute]], and [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] to unite and support a growing number of U.S.-based organizations that work on international affairs. The [[Ford Foundation]] joined the collaborative in 2005, the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]] joined in 2008, the [[Ploughshares Fund]] joined in 2009, and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] joined in 2010. The Connect U.S. Fund operated as a project of the [[Tides Center]].&lt;ref name=ConnectUS&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.connectusfund.org/about/history|website =Connect U.S. Fund|title =History|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121102085423/http://connectusfund.org/about/history|archivedate =2 November 2012|deadurl =yes|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative had emerged from a series of meetings among the founding partners in 2002 and 2003 when they discovered that they faced similar challenges, such as "limited public and private resources for foreign policy advocacy, media focus on a narrowly defined security agenda, and the absence of informed and empowered constituencies on global issues to hold policy makers accountable". The foundations agreed that "a collaborative fund, to which each would contribute, might provide an important incentive to collaboration among NGOs, and thereby enhance the collective impact of advocacy efforts. They thus created the Connect U.S. Fund and embarked on two rounds of grantmaking, from 2004 through 2006."&lt;ref name = ConnectUS/&gt;

In November 2006, [[Eric P. Schwartz]] joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its first executive director.&lt;ref name=statedepartment&gt;U.S. State Department. [https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/125768.htm "Biographical Information Eric P. Schwartz"], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a program of grant-making and operations designed to promote a vision of responsible U.S. global engagement during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. In early 2009, Eric Schwartz left to join the [[U.S. State Department]] as the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration]], and [[Nancy Soderberg|Ambassador Nancy Soderberg]] joined the Connect U.S. Fund as its new President. She served until it shut down in 2013.

==Overview ==

The Connect U.S. Fund was managed and administered by the [[Tides Center]]. The Connect U.S. Council provided policy and program guidance for the Connect U.S. initiative, and was composed of representatives from each of the supporting foundations. The Council was supported by the Connect U.S. Fund professional staff and operated as a project of the Tides Center.&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2/&gt;

Through a program of grant-making and operations designed to foster stronger collaboration among non-governmental organizations active on foreign policy issues, the Connect U.S. Fund sought to advance a vision for responsible U.S. global engagement in an increasingly interdependent world.  The Fund supported a community of foundations and non-governmental organizations working together to enhance the effectiveness of their collective advocacy efforts.&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Priority Issues|url=www.connectusfund.org/issues|website=Connect U.S. Fund|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607050956/http://connectusfund.org/issues|archivedate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key issues===
In 2012, the Connect U.S. Fund was focusing on four key issues:&lt;ref name=ConnectUS2/&gt;
* '''[[Human rights]]''': Encourage strong American leadership in multilateral human rights instruments and institutions, including support for the work of the [[International Criminal Court]]; strengthening UN human rights mechanisms; securing ratification of at least one “core” human rights treaty; and a U.S. government structure to prevent [[genocide]] and respond to mass atrocities.
* '''[[Climate change]]''':  Urge U.S. leadership in addressing the climate crisis through making smart investments at home and in the developing world and by promoting innovative solutions for reducing emissions.  This includes eliminating all fossil fuel subsidies and galvanizing investment in adaptation, clean technology, and forest protection in the developing world.
*'''Development''':  Support for international financial and trade reform as a means for global poverty alleviation, including U.S. support for international financial transparency, international financial institution reform, trade preference reform, and [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]] in the developing world, ensuring U.S. civilian agencies have the funds, capacity, and knowledge needed to conduct development, stability operations, and diplomacy effectively in order to strike a better balance between the civilian and military responsibilities in these areas.
* '''Security''':  U.S. support for [[arms control]] treaties, a [[fissile material]] cut-off, and efforts to secure vulnerable nuclear materials

'''''The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man''''' is a 1962 book by [[Marshall McLuhan]], in which the author analyzes the effects of [[mass media]], especially the [[printing press]], on European [[culture]] and human consciousness. It popularized the term ''[[global village (term)|global village]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.31: "But certainly the electro-magnetic discoveries have recreated the simultaneous "field" in all human affairs so that the human family now exists under conditions of a "global village.""&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the idea that [[mass communication]] allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and ''Gutenberg Galaxy'',&lt;ref&gt;Note that Marshall McLuhan himself states quite clearly that "although the main theme of this book is the Gutenberg Galaxy or a configuration of events, which lies far ahead of alphabet and of scribal culture, it needs to be known why, without alphabet, there would have been no Gutenberg. McLuhan 1962, p.40"&lt;/ref&gt; which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially [[books]].

McLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of [[consciousness]] wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, "[[The medium is the message]]," McLuhan argues that [[technology|technologies]] are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of [[movable type]] was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the [[printing press]] led to the creation of [[nationalism]], [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], domination of [[rationalism]], automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and [[Social alienation|alienation]] of [[individual]]s.

Movable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival art]] and the exigencies of the single "point of view". He writes:

:''the world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.''&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==The format of the book—a ''mosaic''==
The book is unusual in its design. McLuhan described it as one which "develops a [[mosaic]] or field approach to its problems".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, first line of the unnamed preface on "page 0")&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic image to be constructed from data and quotations would then reveal "causal operations in history".&lt;ref&gt;(McLuhan 1962, p.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book consists of five parts:

* '''Prologue''',&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1"&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Gutenberg Galaxy''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.11-263&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Galaxy Reconfigured''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.265-79. The full title of this "epilogue" is "THE GALAXY RECONFIGURED or the Plight of Mass Man in an Individualist Society.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bibliographic Index''',&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.281-89&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Index of Chapter Glosses'''.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.291-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of the book, part 2, "The Gutenberg Galaxy", consists of 107 short "chapters",
many of which are just three, two, or even one page(s) in length.
Such a large collection of small chapters does fit the picture of a mosaic.

Apparently, McLuhan also had some ideas about how to browse a book. ''Marshall McLuhan, the guru of The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962), recommends that the browser turn to page 69 of any book and read it. If you like that page, buy the book."&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Such apparent arbitrariness fits with picking a particular piece (or part) of a mosaic and deciding if you like it. Certainly the McLuhan test can be applied to the Gutenberg Galaxy itself. Doing so will reveal a further insight into the purpose of his own book.&lt;ref&gt;"To show by exactly what historical process ["modern man has desacralized his world and assumed a profane existence"] was done is the theme of The Gutenberg Galaxy." McLuhan 1962, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
McLuhan declares his book to be "complementary to ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' by Albert B. Lord."&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; The latter work follows on from the Homeric studies of [[Milman Parry]] who turned to "the study of the Yugoslave epics"&lt;ref name="McLuhan-1962-1" /&gt; to prove that the poems of Homer were oral compositions.

==Four epochs of history==
The book may also be regarded as a way of describing four epochs of history:

&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral tribe culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuscript culture&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan himself proposes to demonstrate that "manuscript culture is intensely audile-tactile compared to print culture; and that means that detached habits of observation are quite uncongenial to manuscript cultures, whether ancient Egyptian, Greek, or Chinese or medieval." 1962, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gutenberg galaxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the break between the time periods in each case the occurrence of a new medium is responsible, the ''hand-writing'' terminates the oral phase, the printing and the electricity revolutionizes afterwards culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel morisse and Uwe lehmann, Marshall McLuhan Project, Philosophy, The Gutenberg Galaxy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given the clue of "hand-writing" that terminates the "oral phase" one expects "printing" to terminate the manuscript phase and the "electrifying" to bring an end to the Gutenberg era. The strangeness of the use of "electrifying" is entirely appropriate in the McLuhan context of 1962. The Internet did not exist then.

McLuhan himself suggests that the last section of his book might play the major role of being the first section:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The last section of the book, "The Galaxy Reconfigured," deals with the clash of electric and mechanical, or print, technologies, and the reader may find it the best prologue.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.0&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Oral tribe culture===
The [[oral tradition]] is not dead. In schools or at home or in the street, where children are taught to learn by heart, to memorize, [[nursery rhyme]]s or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the oral tradition. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who are taught to learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of [[All the world's a stage|the ages of man]] (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child is taught to read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.

McLuhan identifies [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a key that unlocks something of the nature of the oral culture.&lt;ref name="Joyce-1964"&gt;"The fall of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all Christian minstrelsy." Joyce 1964, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;"

Of particular importance to the Oral Culture is the [[Art of memory]].

====The village====
In commenting on the then [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;We have gone from the Soviet Union of McLuhan's day to the Russian Federation today.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan puts "the advertising and PR community" on a par with them in so far that both "are concerned about access to the media and about results."&lt;ref name="gloss 18"&gt;'''gloss 18''': "The interiorization of the technology of the phonetic alphabet translates man from the magical world of the ear to the neutral visual world." McLuhan 1962, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; More remarkably he asserts that "Soviet concern with media ''results'' is natural to any oral society where interdependence is the result of instant interplay of cause and effect in the total structure. Such is the character of a village, or since electric media, such is also the character of global village."&lt;ref name="gloss 18" /&gt;

===Manuscript culture===
The culture of the manuscript (literally hand-writing) is often referred to by McLuhan as [[Print culture|scribal culture]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Medieval illumination, gloss, and sculpture alike were aspects of the art of memory, central to scribal culture.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Associated with this epoch is the [[Art of memory]] (in Latin Ars Memoriae).

===Gutenberg galaxy===
Finnegans Wake:
Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (like Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]'') is one of the texts which McLuhan frequently uses throughout the book in order to weave together the various strands of his argument.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Throughout ''Finnegans Wake'' Joyce specifies the [[Tower of Babel]] as the tower of Sleep,
that is, the tower of the witless assumption, or what [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] calls the reign of the Idols.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan 1962, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Movable type====
His episodic and often rambling history takes the reader from pre-alphabetic tribal humankind to the [[Electronics|electronic age]]. According to McLuhan, the invention of [[movable type]] greatly accelerated, intensified, and ultimately enabled cultural and cognitive changes that had already been taking place since the invention and implementation of the alphabet, by which McLuhan means [[phonemic orthography]]. (McLuhan is careful to distinguish the phonetic [[alphabet]] from [[logographic]]/logogramic writing systems, like [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] or [[ideograms]].)

Print culture, ushered in by the [[Gutenberg press]] in the middle of the fifteenth century, brought about the cultural predominance of the visual over the aural/oral. Quoting with approval an observation on the nature of the printed word from ''Prints and Visual Communication'' by [[William Ivins]], McLuhan remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In this passage [Ivins] not only notes the ingraining of lineal, sequential habits, but, even more important, points out the visual homogenizing of experience of print culture, and the relegation of auditory and other sensuous complexity to the background. [...] The technology and social effects of typography incline us to abstain from noting interplay and, as it were, "formal" causality, both in our inner and external lives. Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' pp. 124-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main concept of McLuhan's argument (later elaborated upon in ''[[The Medium is the Massage]]'') &lt;!-- BOOK TITLE IS MASSAGE NOT MESSAGE DO NOT CHANGE --&gt;is that new technologies (like alphabets, printing presses, and even speech itself) exert a gravitational effect on cognition, which in turn affects social organization: print technology changes our perceptual habits ("visual homogenizing of experience"), which in turn affects social interactions ("fosters a mentality that gradually resists all but a... specialist outlook"). According to McLuhan, the advent of print technology contributed to and made possible most of the salient trends in the [[Modern age|Modern]] period in the [[Western world]]: [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[Protestantism]], [[capitalism]] and [[nationalism]]. For McLuhan, these trends all reverberate with print technology's principle of "segmentation of actions and functions and principle of visual quantification."&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic age===

====The global village====
In the early 1960s, McLuhan wrote that the visual, individualistic print culture would soon be brought to an end by what he called "electronic interdependence": when [[electronic media]] would replace [[visual culture]] with aural/oral culture. In this new age, humankind will move from individualism and fragmentation to a collective identity, with a "tribal base." McLuhan's coinage for this new social organization is the ''[[Global Village (term)|global village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "global village"  specifically as such. According to McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a ''Wake'' scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term. &lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/v1_iss2/1_2art2.htm | publisher=''McLuhan Studies'' (issue 2) | title=The source of the term 'global village' | author=Eric McLuhan | year=1996 | accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes described as having negative connotations in ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'', but McLuhan himself was interested in exploring effects, not making value judgments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of tending towards a vast [[Alexandrian library]] the world has become a [[computer]], an electronic brain, exactly as an infantile piece of [[science fiction]]. And as our senses have gone outside us, [[Authoritarianism|Big Brother]] goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the [[Western world]] a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Key to McLuhan's argument is the idea that technology has no ''per se'' moral bent—it is a tool that profoundly shapes an individual's and, by extension, a society's self-conception and realization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is it not obvious that there are always enough moral problems without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than [[manuscript]] culture could ever do. Print is the technology of [[individualism]]. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. "But", someone says, "we didn't know it would happen." Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue. It is a problem, but not a moral problem; and it would be nice to clear away some of the moral fogs that surround our technologies. It would be good for [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The moral [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of technology's effects on cognition is, for McLuhan, a matter of perspective. For instance, McLuhan contrasts the considerable alarm and revulsion that the growing quantity of books aroused in the latter seventeenth century with the modern concern for the "end of the book." If there can be no universal moral sentence passed on technology, McLuhan believes that "there can only be disaster arising from unawareness of the causalities and effects inherent in our technologies."

Though the [[World Wide Web]] was invented thirty years after ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' was published, McLuhan may have coined and certainly popularized the usage of the term "[[surfing]]" to refer to rapid, irregular and multidirectional movement through a heterogeneous body of documents or knowledge, e.g., statements like "[[Heidegger]] surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as [[Descartes]] rode the mechanical wave." [[Paul Levinson]]'s 1999 book ''Digital McLuhan'' explores the ways that McLuhan's work can be better understood through the lens of the digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.cyberchimp.co.uk/U75102/levinson.htm#ch3 | author=Paul Levinson | title=Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | ISBN=0-415-19251-X}} Book has been translated into Japanese, Chinese, Croatian, Romanian, and Korean.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Bill Stewart (internet historian)|Bill Stewart]]'s 2007 "Living Internet" website describes how McLuhan's "insights made the concept of a global village, interconnected by an electronic nervous system, part of our popular culture well before it actually happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stewart | first = Bill | title = Marshall McLuhan Foresees The Global Village | work = Living Internet | date = 2000-01-07 | url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_mcluhan.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLuhan frequently quoted [[Walter Ong]]'s ''Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue'' (1958), which evidently had prompted McLuhan to write ''The Gutenberg Galaxy''. Ong wrote a highly favorable review of this new book in ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;''America'' 107 (Sept. 15, 1962): 743, 747.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ong later tempered his praise, by describing McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' as "a racy survey, indifferent to some scholarly detail, but uniquely valuable in suggesting the sweep and depth of the cultural and psychological changes entailed in the passage from illiteracy to print and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' 8 (1967): 838.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan himself said of the book, "I'm not concerned to get any kudos out of [''The Gutenberg Galaxy'']. It seems to me a book that somebody should have written a century ago. I wish somebody else had written it. It will be a useful prelude to the rewrite of ''Understanding Media'' [the 1960 NAEB report] that I'm doing now." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

McLuhan's ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' won Canada's highest literary award, the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction]], in 1962.  The chairman of the selection committee was McLuhan's colleague at the University of Toronto and oftentime intellectual sparring partner, [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies''''' is a 2014 book by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Andrew McAfee]] which is a continuation of their book ''[[Race Against the Machine]]''. They argue that the Second Machine Age involves the automation of a lot of cognitive tasks that make humans and software-driven machines substitutes, rather than complements. They contrast this with what they call the "First Machine Age", or [[Industrial Revolution]], which helped make labor and machines complementary.&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_New_York_Times_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/opinion/sunday/friedman-if-i-had-a-hammer.html |title=If I Had a Hammer |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 11, 2014 |author= |accessdate= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples that the book cites include "software that grades students' essays more objectively, consistently and quickly than humans" and "news articles on Forbes.com about corporate earnings previews" — "all generated by algorithms without human involvement."&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_Huffington_Post_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-teuber/the-coming-of-the-second-machine-age_b_4648207.html |title=The Coming of the Second Machine Age |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date= January 22, 2014 |author=Bill Teuber |accessdate= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The authors summarize the contents of their book's 15 chapters &lt;ref name="SMA_TOC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://library.villanova.edu/Find/Record/1499477/TOC |title=The Second Machine Age: Table of Contents |accessdate= October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on pages 11 and 12 of the book itself.

According to the authors, the book has three sections. Chapters 1 through 6 describe "the fundamental characteristics of the second machine age," based on many examples of modern use of technology. Then chapters 7 through 11 describe economic impacts of technology in terms of two concepts the authors call "bounty" and "spread." What the authors call "bounty" is their attempt to measure the benefits of new technology in ways reaching beyond such measures as [[GDP]], which they say is inadequate. They use "spread" as a shorthand way to describe the increasing inequality that is also resulting from widespread new technology.

Finally, in chapters 12 through 15, the authors prescribe some policy interventions that could enhance the benefits and reduce the harm of new technologies.

==Reception==
The ''[[Washington Post]]'' says that its strength is how it weaves micro and macroeconomics with insights from other disciplines into an accessible story. It says that the weaknesses of the book are that its policy prescriptions are "straight from the talking points that tech executives have been peddling for years on their visits to the capital", even though they are "perfectly reasonable".&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_Washington_Post_July_8_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/review-the-second-machine-age-by-erik-brynjolfsson-and-andrew-mcafee/2014/01/17/ace0611a-718c-11e3-8b3f-b1666705ca3b_story.html |title=Review: ‘The Second Machine Age,' by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USPID''' (''Unione Scienziati per il Disarmo'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is the '''Italian Union of Scientists for Disarmament''', an association established in 1982 with the purpose of providing information about and analysis of arms control and [[disarmament]].

Members of USPID believe that this task is part of the social responsibility of scientists.

The issues addressed by USPID include [[nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]-control and disarmament, nuclear proliferation, consequences of nuclear explosions, control of fissile material, developments of military technology, conventional disarmament, chemical and biological disarmament, problems of conflicts and conflict resolution.

Members of USPID, both individually and collectively, share their views with Italian policy-makers and opinion-makers.

USPID organizes conferences and meetings, including the biennial Castiglioncello conference (now at its 11th edition), courses and seminars in Italian Universities, courses for high-school teachers.

USPID promotes the establishment of inter-departmental Centers affiliated to Italian Universities, and has actively collaborated for many years with the CIRP-UniBa (Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerche sulla Pace, [[University of Bari]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Upward Communication''' is the process of [[information flow]]ing from the lower levels of a [[hierarchy]] to the upper levels.  This type of [[communication]] is becoming more popular in organizations as traditional forms of communication are becoming less popular. The more traditional organization types such as a hierarchy, places people into separate ranks.

Upward [[communication]] helps [[employees]] to express their [[requirements]], ideas, and feelings. For the top management, upward communication is an important source of information for [[Business &amp; Decision|business decisions]]. It helps in alerting top management about the requirement of changes in an organisations. Upward contribution is the core contributor of business process re-engineering in many organisations.

Upward communication is widely used as part of [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] policy in many large organisations. Under whistle blowing policy, each employee is permitted to directly communicate with top management about matters requiring examination on vigilance angle. Hence it is used as a [[fraud prevention]] tool as well.

Upward communication keeps managers aware of how employees feel about their jobs, policies and procedures, and the business in general. It consists of methods like Feedback from employees, helps in bringing Mutual Trust and helps the organization to determine, implement or decide upon new policies. It keeps the organization updated or prone to upcoming challenges.

Upward communication is not free from disadvantages too. It suffers from problems like information can be changed during transmission, unwillingness to participate, fear of inefficiency, bypassing and flattery too. Sometimes top level executives discourage the upward flow of information and neglect the constructive suggestions and opinions about the work related issues of the organization. It is a time taking process and is comparatively slow too.

{{Feudal status}}
A '''villein''', otherwise known as ''cottar'', ''[[crofter]]'', is a [[serfdom|serf]] tied to the land in the [[feudal system]]. Villeins had more rights and status than those in [[slavery]], but were under a number of legal restrictions which differentiated them from the [[Estates of the realm|freeman]].

==Etymology==

'''Villein''' was a term used in the [[feudalism|feudal era]] to denote a [[peasant]] (tenant farmer) who was legally tied  to a [[lord of the manor]]&amp;nbsp;– a '''villein in gross'''&amp;nbsp;– or in the case of a '''villein regardant''' to a [[manor]].&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Villeins occupied the social space between a [[free peasant]] (or "freeman") and a [[slave]]. The majority of [[medieval Europe]]an peasants were villeins. An alternative term is [[serf]], from the [[Latin]] ''servus'', meaning "slave". A villein was thus a bonded tenant, so could not leave the land without the landowner's consent.

The term derives from [[Late Latin]] ''villanus'', meaning a man employed at a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[villa rustica]], or large agricultural estate. The system of tied serfdom originates from a decree issued by the late [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] (ruled 284–305) in an attempt to prevent the flight of peasants from the land and the consequent decline in food production. The decree obliged peasants to register in their locality and never leave it; they could leave their villages only to deliver a message or to accompany their lord to war.

Because of the low status, the term became derogatory. In modern French ''vilain'' means "ugly" or "naughty"  and in Italian, ''Villano'' means "rude" or "ill-mannered". For the Spanish ''Villano'', the [[Real Academia Española|RAE]] preserves the definition of "neighbor or inhabitant of a village or town", but it also accepts the derogatory use, which is very similar to English usage; in modern English [[villain]] means a scoundrel, criminal or a lawless member of society.

==Villeinage==

Villeinage was important and commonplace in the European [[Middle Ages]], though it was later superseded in most of Western Europe.

Villeins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with their landlord, they were expected to use some of their time to farm the lord's [[demesne]] or provide other services, possibly in addition to a rent of money or goods. These services could be very onerous. Villeins might also be required to pay a fine on the marriage of their daughters outside of the manor, the inheritance of a holding by a son, or other circumstances. Villeins were tied to the land and could not move away without their lord's consent.

However, except to their own lords, they were free men in the eyes of the law. Villeins were generally able to have their own property, unlike slaves.

Villeinage, as opposed to other forms of [[serfdom]], was most common in Western European feudalism, where land ownership had developed from roots in Roman law.

A variety of kinds of villeinage existed in the [[Europe]]an [[Middle Ages]], and it is impossible to arrive at a precise definition which satisfies them all. Different times and countries dealt with villeinage in slightly different ways. Some villeins had clearly defined and limited responsibilities to their lords, while others were essentially at their whim.

The array of restrictions and taxes seems harsh and arbitrary to modern minds. However, it makes sense if one views the medieval [[manorialism|manor]] as an economic unit. For instance, the marriage of a daughter away meant the loss of an able-bodied worker to the village. 

Villeinage was not always an involuntary arrangement. In the early Middle Ages families entered villeinage voluntarily, to guarantee tenure of land. And while villeins were heavily restricted in what they could do, it was also possible for them to gain [[manumission]]. Many villeins were in villeinage because of the land they held, rather than by birth, and could become free men if their lord agreed with them to move them to a different holding.

Villeinage was not a purely exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land guaranteed sustenance and survival; being a villein guaranteed access to land. Landlords, even where legally able to, rarely evicted villeins because of the value of their labour. Villeinage was much preferable to being a [[landless labourer]] (such as [[Cotter (farmer)|cotter]]), a [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]], or a slave.

Villeinage became progressively less common through the Middle Ages, particularly after the [[Black Death]] reduced the rural population and increased the bargaining power of workers.  Furthermore, the lords of many [[manor]]s were willing (for payment) to [[manumission|manumit]] their villeins.  It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status, but land held by villein [[tenure]] (unless [[enfranchise]]d) continued to be held by what was henceforth known as a [[copyhold]] tenancy, which was not abolished until [[1925]].  Villeinage continued in France until 1789.

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H.

In this private museum one will find important Phelps family study books, as well as 8000 scientific volumes in the library,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|author=Marcos Kirschstein y José Daniel Ramos|title=El bulevar de Sabana Grande esconde un misterio de ochenta años|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/videos/cultura/bulevar-sabana-grande-esconde-misterio-ochenta-anos_69876|date=2018-01-29|accessdate=2018-05-29|work=El Nacional|location=|page=|number=|Apellido 2=}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than 83,000 anatomical specimens, more than 80,000 skins, etc.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;  For the year 1990, it was said that the William Phelps Ornithological Collection contained more than 76,300 skins and a small number of anatomical specimens, in the Gran Sabana Building of [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]]. The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project concepts ==

=== Youth Council of the SHANGHAI ORGANISATIONS COOPERATION ===

=== SMS for Life ===

This program provides free sms-informing of young pregnant women about the pregnancy period. It is based on advice on healthy lifestyle for women in different periods of the pregnancy, legal advice for future mothers and advice on childcare during the first months of life. Medical recommendations were prepared by highly skilled experts of D.O.Ott scientific research institute of obstetrics and gynecology. National program «SMS for life» was approved by the participants of the First International Congress of perinatal medicine, which was held in Moscow 16.06.2011. Leading accoucheurs-gynecologists of the world highly appreciated efficiency of the program and recommended it to implementation at regional level.

=== The Youth City ===

The high cost and inaccessibility of residential property for citizens precisely is the most serious problem for young families in Russia today. One of the main reasons that causes high prices on residential property is corruption. The Supervisory Board that acts within the Program scope consists of representatives from the legislative and executive bodies of Russia and allows to remove corruption component out of the Program implementation.
The main goal of the Program is to construct small satellite towns where young families can  purchase their first homes at the lowest price possible as well as work in the emerging industries. The residents of these towns will be able to work without actually leaving the town because of construction of complex residential property as well as complete set of social and business infrastructure.

=== A.N. Tolstoy’s International Competition of the Children's and Youth Literature ===

The Youth Public Chamber holds annual competition of the children's and youth literature of a name of A.N.Tolstoy.
