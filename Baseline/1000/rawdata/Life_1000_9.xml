==Impact on Music==

Jordana's work has influenced other artists such as well known [[dubstep]] producer [[Bassnectar]] who heavily sampled ''5 A.M. Rinse (feat. MC Sphinx)'', the last song on her first album ''When Worlds Collide'' for his song ''Here We Go'' off of his 2010 EP and single ''[[Timestretch (album)|Timestretch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iphoneunclockseattle|title=Bassnectar's Here We Go sample of 1.8.7 feat.

In 1999 Drum &amp; Bass/Hip Hop producer and label owner Hive approached Jordana to remix her song ''Defcon-1'' also off of ''When Worlds Collide''. Hive's remix appears on his 2001 album ''The Raw Uncut''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hive – The Raw Uncut EP|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hive-The-Raw-Uncut-EP/release/70304|work=Discogs|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordana collaborated with [[Lady Sovereign]] on a song early in Sov's career after the two met through an internet chat room for StrikeFM.co.uk, an online radio station which Jordana had a show, and the now defunct UKGargageWorldwide.com forums. The two would later team up when Jordana under her Lady J alias, had Lady Sovereign MC for her radio show on Flex 103.6FM London.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_21_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flexfm.net/site/index.php |title=: : Welcome to the FLEX FM NETWORK - Home of FLEX 103.6 FM - LONDON : : |newspaper=Https: |date= |author= |accessdate=December 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601214235/http://www.flexfm.net/site/index.php |archivedate=June 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand based Dubstep and Drum &amp; Bass producer Alexis K/Unsub has also cited Jordana as an influence and the two are collaborating on music and a possible tour.

==History==

Jordana first came to the attention of the music industry when she was asked to remix Blondie's "Atomic." Her "Beautiful Drum &amp; Bass Remix" appeared along with Armand Van Helden and Diddy's remixes on the single.&lt;ref name="Group1999"/&gt; A little over a year following that release Mac McFarlane, the promoter of the well established and legendary New York City Drum'n'Bass club night, Konkrete Jungle, contacted Jordana to create a Konkrete Jungle themed song for a CD compilation/mix-CD. Jordana created the song "Konkrete Jungle" for that purpose. Described by CMJ as containing "menacing hardstep attacks"&lt;ref name="Inc.1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ikEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|date=October 1998|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=62–|issn=1074-6978}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was released on the Ultra Records compilation, "Konkrete Jungle - Maximum Drum &amp; Bass," mixed by BBC Radio 1 Drum'n'Bass show regular host Jumping Jack Frost. Following extensive touring throughout North America and abroad as a live Drum &amp; Bass artist, Liquid Sky Music, an indie label distributed by Caroline Distribution signed her to a three-album contract in late 1996.

==Hate Crime in Ohio==

On the night of February 22, 2000 in Kent, Ohio Jordana was attacked and brutally beaten in a transphobic hate crime by a group of men including Matthew Gostlin of Akron, Ohio.&lt;ref name="Maximum Rocknroll"&gt;{{cite book|title=Maximum Rocknroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SHVbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%221.8.7%22+bass&amp;dq=%221.8.7%22+bass|year=2000|publisher=Maximum Rock 'n' Roll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gostlin and other assailants jumped her in the parking lot outside of "The Robin Hood" nightclub where she had just performed on the Cities Collection tour. The attack took place while she was escorted from the event with the event promoter to the promoters car. The group of men attacked suddenly and Jordana lost consciousness almost immediately after being struck in the face. She suffered nerve damage to the lower part of her face from her lower lip down as a result. 
She was quoted as saying in the May issue of CMJ New Music Monthly that in the seconds just prior to the attack: "I saw his face. I remember the look on his face. It was this look of utter hate, like 'I'm going to kill you.'"&lt;ref name="Inc.2000.4"&gt;{{cite book|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GioEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=May 2000|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=13|issn=1074-6978}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Meesig of Cleveland, Ohio shoved one of the men away and helped Jordana.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Villagevoice.com_December_21_2015c.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/music-6395337 |title=Music |newspaper=Villagevoice.com |date= |author= |accessdate= December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the Village Voice following the attack, Meesig stated that Gostlin had "misgendered" her.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other reports from people on the message board for Breakbeat Science (a NYC based Drum'n'Bass record store) mentioned transphobic slurs being shouted during the attack.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Villagevoice.com_December_21_2015c.1"/&gt; Jordana subsequently cancelled the tour to recover.&lt;ref name="Maximum Rocknroll"/&gt; Gostlin, while charged, was never arrested nor spent any time in court. Jordana's family was told by the Portage County (Ohio) prosecutor's office that attempts had been made to serve the warrant but Gostlin's whereabouts were unknown. As a result of no movement on the case by the authorities, Jordana felt that justice would not be served. They{{clarify|reason=Who is "they"?|date=June 2016}} left the U.S. for England because of their concerns about personal safety and well-being.

==Additional Work in Music Industry==

In addition to production Jordana has also been a DJ, musician and singer. In 2001–2002 Jordana worked at Flex FM in London, England as Lady J with [[Lady Sovereign]] MCing for her during Jordana's radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukmusic.com/forum/chit-chat/lock-in-to-flex-fm-2nite-10911.html|title = Lock in to FLex FM 2nite|last = Sovereign|first = Lady|date = May 18, 2002|work = ukmusic.com/|accessdate = May 30, 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140810062924/http://www.ukmusic.com/forum/chit-chat/lock-in-to-flex-fm-2nite-10911.html|archive-date = August 10, 2014|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 she held a club residency spinning [[UK Garage]], [[2-Step Garage]] and [[House Music]] at legendary club night Trinity in London's Vauxhall neighborhood.

'''Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph''' (born October 22, 1992), better known by his stage name '''21 Savage''', is an American [[rapper]], record producer, and songwriter from [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Abraham-Joseph grew up around criminality and eventually dropped out of school, beginning to rap in 2013 after the death of a friend.

After dropping out, Abraham-Joseph joined a gang affiliated with the [[Bloods]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He also took parts in other criminal activities including robbery and grand theft auto regularly, though only being arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-savage-profile-2018|title=21 Savage: From Robbin’ Season to Role Model|last=Wood|first=Samuel Hine, Geordie|date=2018-06-27|work=GQ|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, when Abraham-Joseph was 19, he lost his "right hand" man, Larry in a shootout.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In 2013, on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph was shot six times and his brother Johnny "Tay-Man" was killed during an attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|website=[[The Fader]]|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2014–15: Early releases===
Following the death of his friend in a shootout on his 21st birthday, Abraham-Joseph began rapping, naming himself after the event&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; though Savage came from Instagram predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/features/facts/21-savage/|title=19 Facts You Need To Know About 'Rockstar' Rapper 21 Savage|work=Capital XTRA|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His music career was originally subsidized by the uncle of his deceased friend, giving him money for studio time in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On November 12, 2014, 21 Savage's debut single, "Picky", produced by DJ Plugg, was released. It was later included on his debut mixtape, ''[[The Slaughter Tape]]'', which was released on May 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/34127/21-savage-the-slaughter-tape.html|title=21 Savage - The Slaughter Tape|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release made him what [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] called an "underground hero in Atlanta."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On July 2, 2015, 21 released a collaborative EP, ''Free Guwop'', with [[Sonny Digital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/35036/21-savage-free-guwop-ep.html|title=21 Savage - Free Guwop EP|work=LiveMixtapes|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence [[Gucci Mane]].

The EP gained international success and peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], which became their highest charting EP to date.&lt;ref name="BB2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/7447109/21-savage/chart|title=21 Savage – Chart History: Billboard 200|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the cover of [[Fader (magazine)|''Fader'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/21-savage-and-futures-x-is-now-platinum-news.25668.html|title=21 Savage on the cover of Fader|last=Lilah|first=Rose|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His single "[[X (21 Savage and Metro Boomin song)|X]]" featuring [[Future (rapper)|Future]] on the EP was confirmed by Billboard as going platinum in the US, being 21's 1st platinum record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/11/21-savage-first-platinum-record-x/|title=21 Savage Gets His First Platinum Record With "X"|last=Weinstein|first=Max|date=November 22, 2016|website=|publisher=|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2017, Abraham-Joseph announced that he had signed to [[Epic Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/news/id.42064/title.21-savage-inks-record-deal-with-epic-records#|title=21 Savage Inks Record Deal With Epic Records|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2018, [[Halloween]], Abraham-Joseph posted on his Instagram a picture of a man in silhouette jumping in the air in the direction away from a large blaze. In the bottom right corner of the picture there is a "Parental Advisory" notice, as there oftentimes is on the cover of rap releases. Abraham-Joseph also tagged Metro Boomin in the post. For these reasons, some speculated it to be a sequel to 2017's ''Without Warning'' record. However, it turned out to be the cover for Metro’s debut solo album, ''[[Not All Heroes Wear Capes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfcqeBtAT/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=21savage|title=Saint Laurent Don on Instagram: "y’all know what season it is @metroboomin 4L"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical style ==
Called "one of the last street niggas left making music" by frequent collaborator Metro Boomin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2015/10/01/feature-21-savage|title=Meet 21 Savage, Atlanta’s Most Respected New Rapper|work=The FADER|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham-Joseph's music is heavily autobiographic with emphasis on violent and criminal aspects of his past including murder and drug dealing.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Controversies==
In 2018, 21 Savage reportedly started a movement called "Guns Down, Paintballs Up" which was intended to reduce gun violence.&lt;ref name="CBS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paintball-wars-initially-intended-to-curb-gun-violence-linked-to-2-deaths/|title="Paintball wars," initially intended to curb gun violence, linked to 2 deaths|last=Diaz|first=Adriana|date=May 1, 2018|website=[[CBS News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the [[Detroit Police Department]], [[James Craig (police chief)|James Craig]], described the movement as "well-intentioned, however, misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paint-up-guns-down-detroit-paintball-arrests-2018-04-27/|title=Detroit police cracks down on citywide "paintball wars"|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=April 21, 2018|website=CBS News|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/04/27/detroit-police-crack-down-citywide-paintball-wars/560019002/|title=Detroit police to crack down on citywide 'paintball wars'|last1=Patterson|first1=Brandon|last2=Zaniewski|first2=Ann|date=April 27, 2018|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has been linked to several cases of property crime and homicide.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/01/paintball-wars-spate-shootings/569407002/|title=Paintball shootings splatter cities after rapper calls for swapping handguns for paintball weapons|last1=Mensch|first1=Jessica|last2=Luthern|first2=Ashley|date=May 1, 2018|website=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 Savage has not commented on the matter, although he paid for the funeral of a 3-year old who was killed in a related incident.&lt;ref name="CBS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today2" /&gt;

'''Tauheed Epps''' (born September 12, 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/09/13/video-2-chainz-gets-his-big-booty-birthday-wish/ |title=2 Chainz Gets His Big Booty Birthday Wish |website=Rap-Up.com|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsagents.net/index.php/content/content17/176-2-chainz |title=2 Chainz |website=Sportsagents.net |date= |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''2 Chainz''' (formerly '''Tity Boi'''), is an American rapper, songwriter, television personality, activist, and actor. Born and raised in [[College Park, Georgia]], he initially gained recognition for being one-half of the [[Southern hip hop]] duo [[Playaz Circle]], alongside his longtime friend and fellow rapper Earl "Dolla Boy" Conyers. The duo was signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper [[Ludacris]]' [[Disturbing tha Peace]] label, and are best known for their debut single "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]".

In February 2012, Epps signed a solo [[record deal]] with [[Def Jam Recordings]], an imprint of [[Universal Music Group]]. The following August, he released his debut studio album ''[[Based on a T.R.U. Story]]'', to mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/based-on-a-tru-story/2-chainz/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Based on a T.R.U. Story |website=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album spawned three successful singles: "[[No Lie (2 Chainz song)|No Lie]]," "[[Birthday Song]]," and "[[I'm Different (2 Chainz song)|I'm Different]]", all of which charted in the top 50 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and were certified Gold or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], along with the album being certified Gold. His second studio album ''[[B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time]]'' was released on September 11, 2013. It was supported by the singles "[[Feds Watching]]" and "[[Used 2]]". Mr. Chainz began working with the TV Network [[Viceland]] on a show called [[Most Expensivest]], which debuted its first episode on November 15, 2017, and is currently in its second season.

==Early life and education==
2 Chainz was born '''Tauheed Epps''' in [[College Park, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/2-chainz-might-run-for-mayor-of-college-park-georgia-2015281|title=2 Chainz Might Run for Mayor of College Park, Georgia: Rapper Gets Political|website=Us Weekly|first=Madeline|last=Boardman|date=January 28, 2015|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[North Clayton High School]], where he played basketball and graduated second in his class.&lt;ref name=beast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/27/2-chainz-is-no-donald-trump-fan.html|title=2 Chainz Is No Donald Trump Fan|website=The Daily Beast|first=Marlow|last=Stern|date=March 27, 2016|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in high school, he dealt [[marijuana]] and was arrested for felony [[cocaine]] possession when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; He later attended [[Alabama State University]] on a scholarship, and played on its basketball team from 1995 to 1997.&lt;ref name="sports-reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tauheed-epps-1.html|title=Tauheed Epps|accessdate=July 4, 2017|work=S-R CBB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/playbooksounds/post/_/id/3120/how-good-was-2-chainz-at-basketball |website=espn.go.com |publisher=ESPN |title=How good was 2 Chainz at basketball? |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about longstanding rumors that he had graduated from Alabama State with a 4.0 GPA, which had been widely reported on many sources including [[Wikipedia]], 2 Chainz said: "Don't believe anything on Wack-ipedia. There's a lot of false stuff on there, to the point that every time I try to fix one thing, something else comes out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-suddenly-2-chainz-is-everywhere-20120813 | title=Five Reasons Why 2 Chainz Should Make A Presidential Bid | work=The Observer | date=September 25, 2012 | accessdate=January 10, 2016 | author=Vanessa Quilantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he transferred to [[Virginia State University]] due to circumstances he was reluctant to speak about.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt; "I got into some trouble, went somewhere else, and came back. But I graduated, and that’s that. That was then," he said.&lt;ref name=beast/&gt;

==Career==

===1997–2010: Playaz Circle and Disturbing tha Peace===

Ludacris soon became one of the highest-selling rappers in the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt; After hearing of their situation, Ludacris requested of Epps that the duo join his newly formed record label [[Disturbing Tha Peace]], a subsidiary of [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Epps agreed to sign, although Conyers did not officially join the label until his mother regained her health, a year after the initial signing.&lt;ref name=allmusicbio/&gt;

Their debut album ''[[Supply &amp; Demand (Playaz Circle album)|Supply &amp; Demand]]'', was released on October 30, 2007. The [[lead single]] and their debut single, "[[Duffle Bag Boy]]", became an urban [[hit single]]. The song features [[Lil Wayne]], and was performed by the duo at the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. The duo released their second studio album ''[[Flight 360: The Takeoff]]'', on September 29, 2009. In January 2010, Playaz Circle filmed a music video for their single "Big Dawg" [[featuring]] Lil Wayne and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] at Studio Space Atlanta. Shortly afterwards, Epps left Disturbing tha Peace, a move he claimed was taken in order to advance his career. Although Ludacris was initially reluctant to allow Epps to leave the label (as he felt Epps could still prove financially successful), he eventually accepted the decision.&lt;ref name=albumtitle&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Andres|title=2 Chainz Reveals Album Title, Speaks On Leaving Ludacris' Label|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.19019/title.2-chainz-reveals-album-title-speaks-on-leaving-ludacris-label|work=HipHopDX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=May 20, 2012|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epps began 2016 with the March release of a 12 record collaborative album with rapper [[Lil Wayne]] titled ''[[ColleGrove]]''. The album was supposed to be the debut LP between 2 Chainz and [[Lil Wayne]], however, Wayne’s ongoing lawsuit with [[Cash Money Records]] prevented Wayne from being a primary artist on the album. Epps appears as the primary artist on the album with eight tracks featuring [[Lil Wayne]]. The album features prominent producers such as: [[Honorable C.N.O.T.E.]], [[Mike Will Made It]], [[Zaytoven]], [[TM88]], [[Metro Boomin]], [[London on da Track]], and more. ''[[ColleGrove]]'' received decent reviews from critics and fans.

''[[Daniel Son; Necklace Don]]'' originally featured [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[YFN Lucci]] on it but Epps chose to move the song, "Big Amount ft. Drake" to 2017 studio album ''[[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music]]'' due to its mass appeal on the mixtape and star power performance. ''[[Daniel Son; Necklace Don]]'' received a 3 out of 5 stars review from [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]].

2016 was wrapped up by Epps third mixtape titled ''[[Hibachi for Lunch]]'', released October 28.

In 2017 Epps released his fourth studio album titled ''[[Pretty Girls Like Trap Music]]'' on June 16 by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album features [[Travis Scott]], [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Swae Lee]], [[Migos]], [[Jhené Aiko|Jhene Aiko]], [[Pharrell Williams]], and more. Album production was done by [[Mike Will Made It]], Buddah Bless, [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], [[Murda Beatz]], and more.

He stated the content would maintain its edginess while also elevating [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]] to a point where everyone can appreciate it. ''Pretty Girls Like Trap Music'' received widespread critical acclaim, with most critics citing the album as his best album yet.

On November 15, 2017, the first episode of [[Most Expensivest]] aired on the TV network [[Viceland]].

Each show covers a particular theme, with shows ranging from personal health to extravagant indulgences. The show offers a unique insight into products and services that have been created with the explicit intent on being exclusive and expensive. 2 Chainz offers a unique, and often humorous insight into the products, especially the ones he personally finds to be either amazing or ridiculous. The show has been renewed for a 20-episode third season set to air in early 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://premieredate.news/tv-series/4568-most-expensivest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===
At the age of 15, Epps was convicted of [[felony]] [[cocaine]] possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/07/2-chainz-breakfast-club-interview |title=2 Chainz Breakfast Club Interview |website=Complex |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2013, Epps was arrested in [[Maryland]] en route to a concert at [[University of Maryland Eastern Shore|UMES]] for [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] possession. Epps was then cited and released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Chainz Arrested in Maryland on Marijuana Charge|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/2-chainz-arrested-in-maryland-on-marijuana-charge-20130215|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=February 15, 2013&lt;!-- 1:35 PM--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2013, Epps was arrested while on board a departing flight at [[LAX]] airport for possession of a controlled substance after TSA agents found that his checked bag contained [[marijuana]] and [[promethazine]]. He was booked and charged with [[felony]] narcotics possession. Later that day he posted $10,000 bond and was released. He was due back in court on June 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/06/2-chainz-arrested-in-lax-for-possession-of-marijuana-and-promethazine/ |title=2 Chainz Arrested In LAX For Possession Of Marijuana And Promethazine – XXL |work=Xxlmag.com |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two days previous, he was reportedly robbed at gunpoint outside a [[medical marijuana]] dispensary in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rapper 2 Chainz robbed outside S.F. marijuana dispensary|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/crime/2013/06/10/rapper-2-chainz-robbed-outside-s-f-marijuana-dispensary/|agency=Associated Press|website=SFGate.com|accessdate=June 27, 2013|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before midnight on August 21, 2013, Epps' tour bus was pulled over in [[Oklahoma City|Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], because the passenger side taillights were out.  The arresting officer reported that he smelled marijuana and saw smoke through the open door of the bus after he had stopped and pulled over the bus. The driver of the bus shut the door and told officers he was not authorized to allow them on the bus. The officer said the [[marijuana]] smell gave him probable cause to search, but the driver refused to open the door. After many attempts to enter, the bus was towed with the men still aboard to the police training center in Oklahoma City. Officers obtained a search warrant and the 10 men, including Epps, got off the bus. Police discovered two semi-automatic pistols and a 12-gauge pump shotgun, along with some prescription painkillers and marijuana residue, on the tour bus according to papers filed [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] district Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MICHAEL MCNUTT mmcnutt@opubco.com • |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-police-found-weapons-painkillers-on-rappers-tour-bus-court-papers-show/article/3878935 |title=Oklahoma City police found weapons, painkillers on rapper's tour bus, court papers show |website=News OK |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In her middle school years, 3D Na'Tee honed her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing). Most people know this as "Playing the Dozens". Someone would start a beat by beating on a lunch room table or a garbage can, and off she went, lyrically attacking someone who was bold enough to test her skill. The rhymes were mostly about what they were wearing, how lame they were, or silly they looked.

In 1999, she began recording with local label called '''Clientell Records'''. Over the next five years, she would record multiple mixtapes under the "Snypa Squad" and feature on other projects Clientell Records came out with. However, in 2006, a year after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project '''"3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva"''' followed by '''Volume 2''' in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on '''The Kush 2''' DVD which was produced by [[YMCMB]] president [[Mack Maine]]. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like [[Lil Wayne]], [[Nicki Minaj]], and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] as well as [[Curren$y]] of [[Warner Bros. Records]]

==Career==
After the local success of her first two releases and her critically acclaimed appearance on '''The Kush 2''', she released her third mix tape '''Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown''' followed by a music video for a song she titled, '''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner'''. That video piqued the interest of [[G-Unit Records]] affiliate and [[Shade 45]] [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius XM]] radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to [[New York City|New York]] for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper [[50 Cent|50 Cents']] wildly popular ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by [[Benzino]], former co-owner of [[The Source Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3DNATEE.COM: BIO|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?page_id=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee Explains How HipHop Saved Her Life, Talks Female Rap, and More|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010.

'''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner''' (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFBEAT MAGAZINE: Nola HipHop Awards Nominees Finalized|url=http://www.offbeat.com/2010/10/14/nola-underground-hip-hop-award-nominees-finalized/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for '''Lyricist of the Year''', '''Mixtape of the Year''', and '''Female Artist of the Year'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHLEE NICOLE SPILLS: Winners of the 2010 HipHop Awards Announced|url=http://www.ashleenicolespills.com/2010/10/20/winners-of-the-2010-nola-underground-hip-hop-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixtape included collaborations from [[Curren$y]] (courtesy of Warner Bros.

In early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on [[MTV|MTV's]] SuckerFree Freestyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SUCKERFREE FREESTYLE: 3DNATEE|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[DJ Envy]]. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called '''Go Head'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHAPSODY: Syleena Johnson|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/syleena-johnson/album/chapter-v-underrated/track/go-head-feat-natee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for '''Switch'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLDSTARHIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee's Switch|url=http://hp-www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video800.php?v=wshhd71614snrClf6d9H&amp;set_size=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer [[Timbaland]]. This video gained her a nomination for '''Director of the Year''' and an award for '''Video of the Year'''. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to [[The Hit Factory|Miami's Hit Factory Studio]] to work with her on her next project, The Coronation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONWAX MAGAZINE: Rapper 3D Na'Tee shoots 'Wild' video in New Orleans, produced by Lex Luger|url=http://onwaxmagazine.com/owm/index.php/rapper-3d-natee-shoots-wild-video-in-new-orleans-produced-by-lex-luger/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company [[Mosley Music Group|Mosely Music Group]] and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via [[Twitter]] that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJSMALLZ.COM: INTERVIEW: SOUTHERN SMOKE TV! 3D NA'TEE (@3DNATEE) SPEAKS ON TURNING DOWN RECORD DEAL WITH TIMBALAND|url=http://www.djsmallz.com/blog/2012/5/18/interview-southern-smoke-tv-3d-natee-3dnatee-speaks-on-turni.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: [WOHH EXCLUSIVE]!|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album ''The Coronation'' which featured artists like [[Keri Hilson]], Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's [[Lex Luger (producer)|Lex Luger]], [[Maybach Music Group|Maybach Music Group's]] Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others.

In August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled '''NO LOVE''' produced by [[Maybach Music Group|MMG's]] '''Young Shun''' was the #9 most requested song in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIRIUS XM: #9 Song in the Country|url=https://twitter.com/DontHateBeHated/status/235174781102747648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coronation's second release, '''Lil Kim''' produced by '''Casa Di''' gained tons of recognition as well as it was featured on both [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] and [[The Fader]] Magazines' websites.&lt;ref name="thesource" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee Releases Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and "fell in love" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like [[Trina]], [[Missy Elliott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEBSTAGRAM: Trina Talks to 3D Na'Tee about 'Lil Kim|url=http://web.stagram.com/p/251601262639516075_14212753}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grammy Award Winning [[Chamillionaire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIG DOOR: Chamillionaire|url=http://www.bigdoor.com/company/press/grammy-award-winning-artist-and-bigdoor-ceo-to-speak-at-gamification-summit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his famed social site [https://web.archive.org/web/20120802044043/http://www.chamillionaire.com/videos/play/608 www.chamillionaire.com].

The '''aquatic ape hypothesis''' ('''AAH'''), also referred to as '''aquatic ape theory''' ('''AAT''') and more recently the '''waterside model''',&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Attenborough|first1=David (2016)|title=The Waterside Ape|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07w4y98/episodes/player|website=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea that the ancestors of [[modern human]]s were more [[aquatic mammals|aquatic]] and as such were habitual waders, swimmers and divers. The hypothesis in its present form was proposed by the [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] [[Alister Hardy]] in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as [[shellfish]] on the sea shore and sea bed leading to [[adaptation]]s that explained significant characteristics such as man's functional hairlessness and [[bipedalism]].&lt;ref name="Hardy 1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Alister|title=Was Man More Aquatic in the Past?|journal=New Scientist|date=17 March 1960|volume=7|issue=174|pages=642–45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qUi12M-fpMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was built upon by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]], who added feminist criticism in opposition to the male image of the "mighty hunter" being presented in popular [[anthropological]] works by [[Robert Ardrey]] and others. While her 1972 book ''The Descent of Woman'' was very popular with the public, it attracted little attention from scientists and those who did comment complained that there was no way of testing hypotheses about soft body parts and human habits in the distant past.

Morgan removed the feminist content in several later books and her ideas were discussed at a 1987 conference devoted to the idea.{{sfn|Roede|1991}} Her 1990 book ''Scars of Evolution'' received some favorable reviews but the thesis was subject to scathing criticism from the anthropologist John Langdon in 1997, who characterized it as an "umbrella hypothesis" and argued that the hypothesis is not more [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] than simply [[Null hypothesis|rejecting the hypothesis]].{{sfn|Langdon|1997}}

The hypothesis remains highly controversial and is generally more popular with the lay public than with scientists.&lt;ref name=kmsma&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bender R, Tobias PV, Bender N |title=The Savannah hypotheses: origin, reception and impact on paleoanthropology |journal=Hist Philos Life Sci |volume=34 |issue=1–2 |pages=147–84 |year=2012 |pmid=23272598 |type=Historical article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though much of the mainstream academic community ignored or derided the initial proposal, academics in the last 15 years have conducted research at least in part inspired by AAH.&lt;ref&gt;Milam, Erika (2013). "Dunking the Tarzanists. Elaine Morgan and the Aquatic Ape theory". In Oren Harman &amp; Michael R Dietrich. ''Outsider Scientists: Routes to Innovation in Biology''. University of Chicago Press, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists supportive of AAH have published research that indicates that at some point in the last five million years humans became dependent on [[essential fatty acid]]s and [[iodine]], which are found in abundance in sea resources. Efficient function of the human brain requires these nutrients.{{sfn|Cunnane|Stewart|2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last1=Stewart|editor-first1=K|editor-last2=Cunnane|editor-first2=S|editor-last3=Tattersall|editor-first3=I|year=2014|title=Special Issue: The Role of Freshwater and Marine Resources in the Evolution of the Human Diet, Brain and Behavior|journal=[[Journal of Human Evolution]]|volume=77|pages=1–216|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moca_afc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/aquatic-food-consumption|title=The Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA) -- Aquatic Food Consumption|publisher=Center for Academic Research &amp; Training in Anthropogeny|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Human timeline}}
The German [[pathologist]] [[Max Westenhöfer]] (1871–1957) discussed in 1942 various human characteristics ([[Body hair#Evolution of less body hair|hairlessness]], [[Subcutaneous tissue#Subcutaneous fat|subcutaneous fat]], the regression of the [[olfaction|olfactory organ]], [[Webbed fingers or toes|webbed fingers]], direction of the [[body hair]] etc.) that could have derived from an aquatic past, quoting several other authors who had made similar speculations. As he did not believe human beings were [[apes]], he believed this might have been during the [[Cretaceous]], contrary to what is possible given the geologic and evolutionary biology evidence available at the time.{{sfn|Westenhöfer|1942|p=148}} He stated: "The postulation of an aquatic mode of life during an early stage of human evolution is a tenable hypothesis, for which further inquiry may produce additional supporting evidence."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Westenhöfer|first=Max|title=Der Eigenweg des Menschen. Dargestellt auf Grund von vergleichend morphologischen Untersuchungen über die Artbildung und Menschwerdung |year=1942|pages=309–312|publisher=Verlag der Medizinischen Welt, W. Mannstaedt &amp; Co. |location=Berlin|ref=harv |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/eigenweg-des-menschen-dargestellt-auf-grund-von-vergleichend-morphologischen-untersuchungen-uber-die-menschwerdung-und-artbildung/oclc/311692900 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2 May 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Westenhöfer Max (1948) ''Die Grundlagen meiner Theorie vom Eigenweg des Menschen: Entwicklung, Menschwerdung, Weltanschauung''. Carl Winter Heidelberg. {{ISBN|978-3533019695}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of Westenhöfer's writings, the [[marine biologist]] [[Alister Hardy]] had since 1930 also hypothesized that humans may have had ancestors more aquatic than previously imagined, although his work, unlike Westenhöfer's, was rooted in the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] consensus. On the advice of his colleagues, Hardy delayed presenting the hypothesis for approximately thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FGRH%2FGRH59_01%2FS0016672300030184a.pdf&amp;code=d17034fd127cba9b1d84a553e6b92ef1 Reeve, Eric. Book review: "The Aquatic Ape: Fact or Fiction?" (PDF)]. ''Genetical Research'' (Cambridge University Press), Volume 59 Issue 01 (February 1992): p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hardy|1960}} After he had become a respected academic and knighted for contributions to marine biology, Hardy finally voiced his thoughts in a speech to the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] in [[Brighton]] on 5 March 1960. Several national newspapers reported sensational presentations of Hardy's ideas, which he countered by explaining them more fully in an article in ''[[New Scientist]]'' on 17 March 1960: "My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, [[shell fish|shellfish]], [[sea urchin|sea-urchins]] etc., in the shallow waters off the coast."{{sfn|Hardy|1960}}

The idea was generally ignored by the [[scientific community]] after the article was published.

Another screenwriter, Elaine Morgan, responded to this focus in her 1972 ''Descent of Woman'', which parodied the conventional picture of "the Tarzanlike figure of the prehominid who came down from the trees, saw a grassland teeming with game, picked up a weapon and became a Mighty Hunter,"{{sfn|Morgan|1972|p=11}} and pictured a more peaceful scene of humans by the seashore. She took her lead from a section in Morris's 1967 book which referred to the possibility of an ''Aquatic Ape'' period in evolution, his name for the speculation by the biologist [[Alister Hardy]] in 1960. When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books–''The Aquatic Ape'' (1982), ''The Scars of Evolution'' (1990), ''The Descent of the Child'' (1994) and ''The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis'' (1997)–which explored the issues in more detail.

==The Hardy/Morgan hypothesis==
Hardy's hypothesis as outlined in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' was:
:My thesis is that a branch of this primitive [[ape]]-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, [[shell fish]], [[sea urchin|sea-urchins]] etc., in the shallow waters off the coast. I suppose that they were forced into the water just as we have seen happen in so many other groups of terrestrial animals. I am imagining this happening in the warmer parts of the world, in the tropical seas where Man could stand being in the water for relatively long periods, that is, several hours at a stretch.&lt;ref name="Hardy 1960"/&gt;
Hardy argued a number of features of modern humans are characteristic of aquatic adaptations. He pointed to human's lack of body hair as being analogous to the same lack seen in certain other marine mammals, such as the [[whale]] and the [[hippopotamus]],{{sfn|Morgan|1990|pp=69-79}}&lt;ref name="Langdon 1997, p. 483"&gt;Langdon (1997), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; and noted the layer of [[subcutaneous fat]] humans have that Hardy believed other apes lacked, although it has been shown that captive apes with ample access to food have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Man_s_place_among_the_mammals.html?id=mYI3AAAAIAAJ |last=Wood Jones|first=Frederic|title=Man's Place among the Mammals|accessdate=4 February 2017 |year=1929 |publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; co.|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional features cited by Hardy include the location of the [[trachea]] in the [[throat]] rather than the nasal cavity, the human propensity for front-facing [[copulation]], [[tears]] and [[eccrine sweating]], though these claimed pieces of evidence have alternative evolutionary adaptationist explanations that do not invoke an aquatic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rnGLp3QMiJYC|title=From Mating to Mentality: Evaluating Evolutionary Psychology|last=Sterelny|first=Kim|last2=Fitness|first2=Julie|date=2004-03-01|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9781135432126|location=|pages=250|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy additionally posited that [[bipedalism]] evolved first as an aid to [[wading]] before becoming the usual means of human locomotion,{{sfn|Hardy|1960}}&lt;ref&gt;Langdon (1997), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open [[shellfish]].{{sfn|Hardy|1960|p=645}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Langdon (1997), p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their [[#Related academic and independent research|research programs]].

Morgan summed up her take on the hypothesis in 2011:
:Waterside hypotheses of human evolution assert that selection from wading, swimming and diving and procurement of food from aquatic habitats have significantly affected the evolution of the lineage leading to ''Homo sapiens'' as distinct from that leading to ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ebooks.benthamscience.com/book/9781608052448/chapter/51560/ |last1=Kuliukas|first1=Algis V.|first2=Elaine |last2=Morgan|year=2011|title=Aquatic Scenarios in the Thinking on Human Evolution: What are they and How do they Compare?|pages=106–119|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[File:AAT Confer 3.jpg|thumb|Aquatic Ape Conference delegates in Valkenburg, 1987]]
Academics who have commented on the aquatic ape hypothesis include categorical opponents (generally members of the community of academic [[anthropology]]) who reject almost all of the claims related to the hypothesis. Other academics have argued that the rejection of Hardy and Morgan is partially unfair given that other explanations which suffer from similar problems are not so strongly opposed. A conference devoted to the subject was held at [[Valkenburg (city)|Valkenburg]], [[Netherlands]] in 1987. Its 22 participants included academic proponents and opponents of the theory and several neutral observers headed by the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds of [[Oxford University]]. His summary at the end was:{{quote|Overall, it will be clear that I do not think it would be correct to designate our early hominid ancestors as 'aquatic'. But at the same time there does seem to be evidence that not only did they take to water from time to time but that the water (and by this I mean inland lakes and rivers) was a habitat that provided enough extra food to count as an agency for selection.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1991&gt;{{cite book | last=Reynolds| first=Vernon | title=Cold and Watery?

In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an "umbrella hypothesis" and argued that the [[Falsifiability|difficulty of ever disproving]] such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a [[parsimonious explanation]], it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the [[null hypothesis]] that human evolution is not particularly guided by interaction with bodies of water. Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the "umbrella" nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper [[scientific hypothesis]]. Langdon also objected to Morgan's blanket opposition to the "[[savannah hypothesis]]" which he took to be the "collective discipline of paleoanthropology". He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal. In addition, the evidence cited by AAH proponents mostly concerned developments in [[soft tissue]] anatomy and physiology, whilst paleoanthropologists rarely speculated on evolutionary development of anatomy beyond the musculoskeletal system and brain size as revealed in fossils. After a brief description of the issues under 26 different headings, he produced a summary critique of these with mainly negative judgments. His main conclusion was that the AAH was unlikely ever to be disproved on the basis of comparative anatomy, and that the one body of data that could potentially disprove it was the fossil record.{{sfn|Langdon|1997}}

Anthropologist [[John D. Hawks]] wrote that it is fair to categorize the AAH as [[pseudoscience]] because of the social factors that inform it, particularly the personality-led nature of the hypothesis and the unscientific approach of its adherents.&lt;ref name="hawks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/pseudoscience/aquatic_ape_theory.html|title=Why anthropologists don't accept the Aquatic Ape Theory|authorlink=John D. Hawks|date=4 August 2009|type=Blog post|author=Hawks JD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical anthropologist [[Eugenie Scott]] has described the aquatic ape hypothesis as an instance of "crank anthropology" akin to other pseudoscientific ideas in anthropology such as alien-human interbreeding and [[Bigfoot]].&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2015|title=Quacks and cranks, GMOs and climate, science and philosoph&amp;mdash;CFI Conference covers it all|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/reason_for_change_quacks_and_cranks_gmos_and_climate_science_and_philosophy|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=39|issue=5|page=12|author=Frazier K|authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|accessdate=Feb 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution'' (2013), the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain. He nevertheless criticized the AAH because "it's always a problem identifying features [such as body fat and hairlessness] that humans have now and inferring that they must have had some adaptive value in the past." Also "it's notoriously hard to infer habits [such as swimming] from anatomical structures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUp5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=115|title=The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution|last=Gee|first=Henry|publisher=U of Chicago Press|year=2013|page=115|ref=harv|accessdate=6 January 2017|isbn=9780226044989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the AAH has become an embarrassment to some anthropologists who want to explore the effects of water on human evolution without engaging with the AAH, which they consider "emphasizes adaptations to deep water (or at least underwater) conditions". Foley and Lahr suggest that "to flirt with anything watery in paleoanthropology can be misinterpreted", but argue "there is little doubt that throughout our evolution we have made extensive use of terrestrial habitats adjacent to fresh water, since we are, like many other terrestrial mammals, a heavily water-dependent species." But they allege that "under pressure from the mainstream, AAH supporters tended to flee from the core arguments of Hardy and Morgan towards a more generalized emphasis on fishy things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lahr|first2=Marta Mirazón|year=2014|title=The Role of "the Aquatic" in Human Evolution: Constraining the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=56–59 |last1=Foley|first1=Robert|doi=10.1002/evan.21405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Waterside Ape", a pair of 2016 BBC Radio documentaries, [[David Attenborough]], discussed a "move towards mainstream acceptance” for the AAH in the light of new research findings. Scientists interviewed included Kathlyn Stewart and Michael Crawford who had published papers in a special issue of the ''Journal of Human Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Human Evolution'' Volume 77, Pages 1-216 (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; on "The Role of Freshwater and Marine Resources in the Evolution of the Human Diet, Brain and Behavior".&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"/&gt; Responding to the documentaries in a newspaper article, paleoanthropologist [[Alice Roberts]] dismissed the AAH as a distraction "from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex" and that it had become "a theory of everything" that is simultaneously "too extravagant and too simple".&lt;ref&gt;"It's time we let go of the 'aquatic ape' myth."

"During the last few years, when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleoanthropologists and other experts, I have often asked them to tell me, please, exactly why Elaine Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic theory. I haven’t yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have also wondered the same thing." He challenged both Elaine Morgan and the scientific establishment in that "Both sides are indulging in adapt[at]ionist [[Just-so story|Just So stories]]". Along the same lines, historian [[Erika Lorraine Milam]] noted that independent of Morgan's work, certain standard explanations of human development in paleoanthropology have been roundly criticized for lacking evidence while being based on sexist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Scientists.

In 1995, paleoanthropologist [[Phillip Tobias]] declared that the savannah hypothesis was dead, because the open conditions did not exist when humanity's precursors stood upright and that therefore the conclusions of the Valkenberg conference were no longer valid. Tobias praised Morgan's book ''Scars of Evolution'' as a "remarkable book" though he said that he did not agree with all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tobias |first=Philip|title=Foreword: Evolution, Encephalization, Environment |page=viii}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010|pp=vii-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tobias |first=Philip V |year=1998 |title=Water and Human Evolution |journal=Dispatches Human Evolution |url=http://users.ugent.be/~mvaneech/outthere.htm |accessdate=16 January 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobias and his student further criticised the orthodox hypothesis by arguing that the coming out of the forest of man's precursors had been an unexamined assumption of evolution since the days of [[Lamarck]], and followed by Darwin, [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], well before Raymond Dart used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Savannah Hypotheses: Origin, Reception and Impact on Paleoanthropology| first1=Renato |last1=Bender |first2=Phillip V. |last2=Tobias|first3=Nicole |last3= Bender | journal=Hist.

=== Reactions of Hardy and Morgan ===
Alister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines "Oxford professor says man a sea ape", causing problems with his Oxford colleagues.{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=12}} As he later said to his ex-pupil [[Desmond Morris]], "Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn't a proven fact. And of course we're not related to dolphins."&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"/&gt;

Elaine Morgan's 1972 book ''Descent of Woman'' became an international best-seller, a [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] selection in the [[United States]] and was translated into ten languages.{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=15}} Part of this was related to the growing [[women's liberation movement]] as Morgan's work was inspired by a feminist critique of then-standard anthropological ideas. She assumed that the total lack of response to her book from the academic community was due to the fact that she was an outsider. "The response I had not foreseen was total silence. But in respect of the aquatic theme that is what I got from them - and with few exceptions still get. That kind of silence is a virtually unbeatable strategy".{{sfn|Morgan|2008|p=17}} Morgan removed the feminist critique and rewrote the scientific text, publishing it as ''The Aquatic Ape'' ten years later, but it did not garner greater reaction from scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/may/13/aquatic-ape-elaine-morgan-history-science|title=Elaine Morgan and the Aquatic Ape|last=Milam|first=Erika Lorraine|date=2013-05-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the general reaction to Hardy and Morgan's proposals was silence by the relevant academic community, there have been over the last decades some academics who were inspired by AAH proposals, even to the point of pursuing particular lines of research on its basis. Some of the academics and professional scientists who have supported the AAH include Michael Crawford, Professor and Director of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition at [[Imperial College London]], his former postdoctoral researcher, Stephen Cunnane, now professor of medicine at [[Université de Sherbrooke]], Erika Schagatay, professor of Environmental Physiology at [[Mid Sweden University]], Kathlyn M. Stewart, Section Head of [[Palaeobiology]] at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]], and Tom Brenna, Professor of Paediatrics and Chemistry at [[University of Texas]].

===Wading and bipedalism===
After reviewing 30 different explanations of bipedalism, evolutionary biologist [[Carsten Niemitz]] proposed a "shore dweller" hypothesis of wading, though distancing himself from the AAH.&lt;ref name=newsynth&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00114-009-0637-3 |last=Niemitz |first=Carsten |year=2010 |title=The evolution of the upright posture and gait—a review and a new synthesis |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=241–263 |doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0637-3 |accessdate=4 February 2017 |ref=harv|bibcode=2010NW.....97..241N|pmc=2819487 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Niemitz C |authorlink=Carsten Niemitz |title=A Theory on the Evolution of the Habitual Orthograde Human Bipedalism – The "Amphibische Generalistentheorie" |journal= Anthropologischer Anzeiger |volume=60 |pages=3–66 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Niemitz |first=Carsten |authorlink=Carsten Niemitz |title=Das Geheimnis des Aufrechten Gangs ~ Unsere Evolution Verlief Anders |year=2004 |publisher=Beck |isbn=3-406-51606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He records 10 monkey and ape species, including chimpanzees and gorillas, who have been observed wading on two feet.{{sfn|Niemitz|2010|pp=254,5}} Niemitz's hypothesis places the wading bipedalism of hominids as occurring in the late [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=newsynth /&gt; Other researchers, including AAH proponent Algis Kuliukas, performed experiments to measure the comparative energy used when lacking [[orthograde posture]] with using fully upright posture. Although it is harder to walk upright with bent knees on land, this difference gradually diminishes as the depth of water increases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuliukas |first1=Algis V |first2=Nick |last2=Milne |first3=Paul |last3=Fournier |year=2009 |title=The relative cost of bent-hip bent-knee walking is reduced in water |journal=Journal of Comparative Human Biology |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=479–488 |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2009.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still practical in thigh-high water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halsey|first1=Lewis G |first2=Christopher J |last2=Tyler |first3=Algis V |last3=Kuliukas |year=2014 |title=The energy costs of wading in water |journal=Biology Open |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=571 |doi=10.1242/bio.20147831 |pmid=24907372 |pmc=4154292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a critique of the AAH, [[Henry Gee]] questioned any link between bipedalism and diet. Gee writes that early humans have been bipedal for 5 million years, but our ancestor's "fondness for seafood" emerged a mere 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2013/may/07/aquatic-apes-creationism-evolution|title=Aquatic apes are the stuff of creationism, not evolution|last=Gee|first=Henry|date=2013-05-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food sources, nutrients, and brain size===
[[File:Sapiens neanderthal comparison en blackbackground.png|thumb|Neanderthal skull (right) compared with modern human]]

In their 1989 book ''The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future'', Michael Crawford together with co-author David Marsh wrote about the connections they saw between nutrition and human evolution, and in particular claimed that Omega-3 fatty acids were vital for the development of the brain.{{sfn|Crawford|Marsh|1989}} "A branch of the line of primitive ancestral apes was forced by competition to leave the trees and feed on the seashore. Searching for oysters, mussels, crabs, crayfish and so on they would have spent much of their time in the water and an upright position would have come naturally."{{sfn|Crawford|Marsh|1989|p=162}} Crawford and Marsh argued that the norm of brain size seen in small and aquatic mammals is similar to humans and they further opine that other primates and carnivores had lost relative brain capacity (though the relationship between brain size and intelligence is not isomorphic).{{sfn|Crawford|Marsh|1989|p=159}} Reviewing their book for the ''New Scientist'', biologists Caroline Pond and Dick Colby were highly critical, saying that the work provided "no significant new information that would be of interest to biologists" and that its style was "speculative, theoretical and in many places so imprecise as to be misleading."&lt;ref name="pond"&gt;{{cite journal|date=27 January 1990|title=''The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future'' by Michael Crawford and David Marsh|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517014-300-the-fats-of-evolution-review-of-the-driving-force-evolution-and-the-future-by-michael-crawford-and-david-marsh/|journal=New Scientist|type=Book review|vauthors=Pond C, Colby D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Crawford, "the evolution of a large brain on the savannahs of Africa was impossible. The only way it could have happened was with the resources of the marine food-web which initiated the growth and development of the brain in the first place".&lt;ref name="Attenborough 2016"/&gt; A group of evolutionary nutritionists and paleontologists led by Cunnane, Stewart, and Crawford published works arguing a correlation between aquatic diet and human brain evolution in their "shore-based diet scenario",{{sfn|Cunnane|Stewart|2010}}{{sfn|Stewart|Cunnane|Tattersall|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival of the fattest: the key to human brain evolution|last=Cunnane|first=SC|publisher=World Scientific|year=2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the Hardy/Morgan's thesis as a foundation work of their model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cunnane|first2=Stephen C.|year=2010|title=Introduction|pages=xiii–xvii|ref=harv|last1=Stewart|first1=Kathlyn M.}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe problems in landlocked communities as being supportive of AAH, with reports of [[cretinism]] in the Alps since the 18th century and widespread [[goitre]]s in parts of Africa, which is only prevented by the addition of iodine to diets.{{sfn|Broadhurst|Wang|Crawford|Cunnane|2002|pp=659-660}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venturi|first=Sebastiano and Michel E.

What has been lacking has been the paleontological evidence that early humans consumed fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago.{{sfn|Stringer|Andrews|2005}} Part of the problem has been the avoidance of [[Taphonomy#Taphonomic biases in the fossil record|taphonomic bias]] by researchers: most hominin fossils occur in marginal [[Lacustrine deposits|lacustrine]] environments and the presence of fish remains is therefore no proof of fish consumption. Fish bones often decompose so that special tests are required to detect them.{{sfn|Stewart|2010}} The archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally flawed due to [[postglacial]] [[Past sea level|sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erlandson |first=Jon M. |title=Food for Thought: the Role of Coastlines and Aquatic Resources in Human Evolution}} in {{harvnb|Cunnane|Stewart|2010|pp=125–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diving behavior and performance===
Aside from working as a professor, Schagatay is also an experienced [[Scuba diving|scuba]] and [[Freediving|freediver]] whose research centers around human diving abilities. She suggests that such abilities are consistent with selective pressure for underwater foraging during human evolution, and discussed other anatomical traits speculated as diving adaptations by Hardy/Morgan.&lt;ref name="schagatay_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ebooks.benthamscience.com/book/9781608052448/chapter/51561/ |last=Schagatay |first=E. |title=Human Breath-Hold Diving Ability Suggests a Selective Pressure for Diving During Human Evolution|pages=120–147 |year=2011}} in {{harvnb|Vaneechoutte|Kuliukas|Verhaegen|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Langdon suggested that such traits could be enabled by a human [[developmental plasticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon| first=J.| title=Book review of 'Was Man More Aquatic in the Past?

===Vernix caseosa===

A 2016 research programme conducted by Tom Brenna (then at [[Cornell University]]), with the help of Judy St Leger at [[SeaWorld San Diego|San Diego Seaworld]], compared the chemistry of vernix on human neonates and samples of a vernix-like substance on California Sealion pups. They established that its molecular composition is comparable to human vernix, being rich in both branch chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and squalene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenna|first1=Tom|title=Sea Lions Develop Human-like Vernix Caseosa Delivering Branched Fats and Squalene to the GI Tract|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25871-1|website=Scientific Reports|publisher=Nature|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bjørn Skogstad Aamo''' (born 21 January 1946) is a Norwegian [[economist]] and [[politician]] for the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]]. He was [[State Secretary#Norway|State Secretary]] for three non-consecutive terms between 1973 and 1993, and served as Director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway]] from 1993 to 2011.

==Career==
===Political career===
Born in [[Oslo]],&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Aamo, Bjørn Skogstad |encyclopedia=Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |url=http://www.snl.no/article.html?id=811613 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo grew up in [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]]. He became involved in politics at an early age, and was appointed chairman of the local [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] chapter in 1962. He then moved back to the capital to enroll at the [[University of Oslo]]. He became chairman of the Workers' Youth League chapter there. Situated on the left wing of the organization, he became a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] as well as the Norwegian [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] membership, much to the dismay of party secretary [[Haakon Lie]]. However, Aamo found support from fellow economist [[Per Kleppe]],&lt;ref name=aamo&gt;{{Cite news|first=Helge |last=Røed |title=En viktig nasjonal strateg |work=Fædrelandsvennen |date=21 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time a deputy member of the party central committee and head of the [[think tank]] ''Arbeiderbevegelsens utredningskontor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{stortingetbio|PEKL|name=Per Kleppe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aamo graduated with the degree [[cand.oecon.]] in [[economics]] in 1970, and from 1971 to 1972 he worked as personal secretary (today known as political adviser) in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development|Ministry of Local Government and Labour]]. He was then promoted to [[State Secretary (Norway)|State Secretary]] in the [[Norwegian Ministry of Finance|Ministry of Finance]] from 1973 to 1979, serving under Per Kleppe who had become [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]].&lt;ref name=aamo-2&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Norwegian News Agency |title=60 år 21. januar: Kredittilsynsdirektør Bjørn Skogstad Aamo |date=30 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then head of the department of economics in the [[European Free Trade Association]] from 1979 to 1981, and director{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} of the [[Regional Development Fund]] from 1981 to 1986. He then returned as State Secretary from 1986 to 1989 under Minister of Finance [[Gunnar Berge]] in [[Brundtland's Second Cabinet]]. He lost his job when Brundtland's Second Cabinet fell in 1989, and briefly returned to Regional Development Fund. In 1990 as the short-lived [[Syse's Cabinet]] fell and [[Brundtland's Third Cabinet]] assumed office, Aamo was appointed State Secretary at the [[Norwegian Office of the Prime Minister|Office of the Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="aamo-2"/&gt;

===Financial Supervisory Authority===
In 1993 he was appointed Director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway|Financial Supervisory Authority]], succeeding [[Svein Aasmundstad]]. This decision was criticized by the political opposition.&lt;ref name=negative&gt;{{Cite news|first=Line Noer |last=Borrevik |title=Skogstad Aamo ikke ønsket av politikerne |work=Dagens Næringsliv |date=5 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo belonged to the same political party as [[Minister of Finance (Norway)|Minister of Finance]] [[Sigbjørn Johnsen]] and the rest of Brundtland's Third Cabinet. Since Aamo came directly from a government position, that of state secretary, parliament member [[Lars Gunnar Lie]] cited concern about a perceived lack of distance between the third cabinet Brundtland and the Financial Supervisory Authority. This would put the independence of the latter at odds, he claimed. However, most of the criticism was directed at Sigbjørn Johnsen, who at that time was under scrutiny for his involvement with private corporation [[Storebrand|UNI Storebrand]]. The Financial Supervisory Authority would have a role in this scrutiny, and several people, including parliament member [[Kristin Halvorsen]], asked for the appointment of Johnsen's party fellow be postponed until after the case was closed. Parliament member [[Carl I. Hagen]] called for Johnsen to resign.&lt;ref name="negative"/&gt; On the other hand, conservative newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' defended the decision in an op-ed the next day, citing Aamo's strong qualifications for the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Omstridt, men vel kvalifisert |work=Aftenposten |date=6 March 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism did not hinder the appointment of Aamo, and Sigbjørn Johnsen remained in his seat.

Aamo applied for the position as [[Norges Bank#List of Central Bank Governors|Governor]] of the [[Norges Bank|Central Bank of Norway]] in 1999, but [[Svein Gjedrem]] was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|agency=Norwegian News Agency |title=Jakt på Statoil-sjef og Børs-sjef |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=7149736 |date=9 August 1999 |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[economic crisis of 2008]], Aamo stated that banks are safer in Norway than in any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Vil ha kraftigere lut |url=http://www.orapp.no/bors_og_aksjetips/20081010/vil_ha_kraftigere_lut/ |work=Økonomisk Rapport |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014055816/http://www.orapp.no/bors_og_aksjetips/20081010/vil_ha_kraftigere_lut/ |archivedate=14 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matters are complicated by Norway's close relations to Iceland, whose [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis|national crisis]] had consequences for Norwegian customers in the banks [[Glitnir Bank|Glitnir]] and [[Kaupthing Bank|Kaupthing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= |title=Redder norske sparepenger i islandske krisebanker |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/926521/Redder_norske_sparepenger__i_islandske_krisebanker.html |work=Stavanger Aftenblad |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011074644/http://www.aftenbladet.no/innenriks/926521/Redder_norske_sparepenger__i_islandske_krisebanker.html |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aamo is himself a board member of the [[Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/no/hoved/om-oss/styre/|title=Styre|date=|publisher=Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund|language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218230817/http://www.bankenessikringsfond.no/no/hoved/om-oss/styre/|archive-date=18 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated terms ==
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]]. In general, [[clinical death]] is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of [[legal death]]. A patient with working [[human heart|heart]] and [[human lung|lungs]] determined to be [[brain death|brain dead]] can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. As [[science|scientific knowledge]] and [[medicine]] advance, formulating a precise medical definition of death becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Death Whatever |first=Alexander |last=Artishevsky |publisher=Createspace |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4495-9420-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024043/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality%3B%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf |date=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

===Legal===

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|List of causes of death by rate|List of preventable causes of death}}

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]]. Home deaths, once commonplace, are now rare in the developed world.

In [[developing nations]], inferior sanitary conditions and lack of access to modern [[medical technology]] makes death from [[infectious diseases]] more common than in [[developed countries]].

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] ([[United Nations]] Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006. Ziegler says worldwide approximately 62M people died from all causes and of those deaths more than 36M died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in [[micronutrient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Ziegler]], ''L'Empire de la honte'', Fayard, 2007 {{ISBN|978-2-253-12115-2}} p. 130.{{clarify|reason=The publisher and date given don't match ISBN listings.

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood. It has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olshansky |first=S.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gorban A.N. |author2=Tyukina T.A. |author3=Smirnova E.V. |author4=Pokidysheva L.I. |year=2016 |title=Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and oscillating death|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287251014 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.017 |pmid=26801872 |journal=J.

In high-income and middle income countries nearly half up to more than two thirds of all people live beyond the age of 70 and predominantly die of chronic diseases. In low-income countries, where less than one in five of all people reach the age of 70, and more than a third of all deaths are among children under 15, people predominantly die of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The top 10 causes of death |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html |year=2012 |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

== Cryonics ==
[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead. The aim of this process is to keep such individuals in a state of refrigerated limbo so that it may become possible in the future to resuscitate them, cure them of the condition that killed them, and then restore them to functioning life in an era when medical science has triumphed over the activities of the Banana Reaper."
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcor What is Cryonics"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Cryonics? |url=http://alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |website=[[Alcor Foundation]] |accessdate=2 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics is an effort to save lives by using temperatures so cold that a person beyond help by today's medicine might be preserved for decades or centuries until a future medical technology can restore that person to full health."
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death.&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:White-Rabbit-making-elixir-of-immortality.jpg|thumb|The mythological [[Moon rabbit|White Hare]] making the elixir of life on the Moon, from Chinese mythology.]]
The '''elixir of life''', also known as  '''elixir of immortality''' and sometimes equated with the [[philosopher's stone]], is a [[potion]] that supposedly grants the drinker [[Immortality|eternal life]] and/or [[eternal youth]]. This [[elixir]] was also said to cure all diseases. [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir.

== History ==

=== China ===
[[File:Xu Fu expedition's for the elixir of life.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Xu Fu]]'s first expedition to the [[Mount Penglai|Mount of the immortals]]. By [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
In ancient China, various [[emperor]]s sought the fabled elixir with varying results. In the [[Qin Dynasty]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent [[Taoist]] alchemist [[Xu Fu]] with 500 young men and 500 young women to the eastern seas to find the elixir, but he never came back (legend has it that he found [[Japan]] instead). When Shi Huang Di visited, he brought 3000 young girls and boys, but none of them ever returned.

The ancient Chinese believed that ingesting long-lasting precious substances such as [[jade]], [[cinnabar]] or [[hematite]] would confer some of that longevity on the person who consumed them.  [[Gold]] was considered particularly potent, as it was a non-tarnishing precious metal; the idea of potable or drinkable gold is found in China by the end of the third century BC.  The most famous Chinese alchemical book, the Danjing yaojue (Essential Formulas of Alchemical Classics) attributed to [[Sun Simiao]] (c. 581 – c. 682 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia, A Glick, T.F., A Livesey, S.J., Wallis, F., Routledge, p. 20 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/582108/Tan-chin-yao-chueh|title=Tan chin yao chueh – occultism|work=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous medical specialist respectfully called "King of Medicine" by later generations, discusses in detail the creation of elixirs for immortality (mercury, sulfur, and the salts of mercury and arsenic are prominent, and most are poisonous) as well as those for curing certain diseases and the fabrication of precious stones.

Many of these substances, far from contributing to longevity, were actively toxic and resulted in [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]]. The [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming Dynasty]] died from ingesting a lethal dosage of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the supposed "Elixir of Life" conjured by alchemists. British historian [[Joseph Needham]] compiled a list of Chinese emperors whose deaths were likely due to elixir poisoning{{cn|date=November 2015}}.

=== India ===
[[Amrita]], the elixir of life has been described in the Hindu scriptures (not to be confused with Amrit related to Sikh religion (see [[Amrit Sanskar]])). Anybody who consumes even a tiniest portion of Amrit has been described to gain immortality. Legend has it that at early times when the inception of the world had just taken place, evil demons (Ashur) had gained strength. This was seen as a threat to the gods (Devas) who feared them. So these gods (including [[Indra]], the god of sky, Vayu, the god of wind, and [[Agni]], the god of fire) went to seek advice and help from the three primary gods according to the Hindus: [[Vishnu]] (the preserver), [[Brahma]] (the creator), and [[Shiva]] (the destroyer). They suggested that Amrit could only be gained from the [[samudra manthan]] (or churning of the ocean) for the ocean in its depths hid mysterious and secret objects. Vishnu agreed to take the form of a turtle on whose shell a huge mountain was placed. This mountain was used as a churning pole.

With the help of a [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] (mighty and long serpent, king of Nagloka) the churning process began at the surface. From one side the gods pulled the serpent, which had coiled itself around the mountain, and the demons pulled it from the other side. As the churning process required immense strength, hence the demons were persuaded to do the job—they agreed in return for a portion of Amrit. Finally with their combined efforts (of the gods and demons), Amrit emerged from the ocean depths. All the gods were offered the drink but the gods managed to trick the demons who did not get the holy drink.

The oldest Indian writings, the [[Vedas]] (Hindu sacred scriptures), contain the same hints of alchemy that are found in evidence from ancient China, namely vague references to a connection between gold and long life. Mercury, which was so vital to alchemy everywhere, is first mentioned in the 4th to 3rd century BC [[Arthashastra]], about the same time it is encountered in China and in the West. Evidence of the idea of transmuting base metals to gold appears in 2nd to 5th century AD Buddhist texts, about the same time as in the West.

It is also possible that the alchemy of medicine and immortality came to China from India, or vice versa; in any case, for both cultures, gold-making appears to have been a minor concern, and medicine the major concern. But the elixir of immortality was of little importance in India (which had other avenues to immortality). The Indian elixirs were mineral remedies for specific diseases or, at the most, to promote long life.

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Dell' elixir vitae 1624 Donato d'Eremita Plate 1 AQ14 (1).jpg|thumb|''Dell' elixir vitae'', 1624]]
In European [[alchemical]] tradition, the Elixir of Life is closely related to the creation of the philosopher's stone. According to legend, certain alchemists have gained a reputation as creators of the elixir. These include [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]].

== Names ==
The Elixir has had hundreds of names (one scholar of Chinese history reportedly found over 1,000 names for it), among them Amrit Ras or [[Amrita]], Aab-i-Hayat, Maha Ras, Aab-Haiwan, Dancing Water, Chasma-i-Kausar, Mansarover or the Pool of Nectar, [[Philosopher's stone]], and Soma Ras.  The word ''[[wikt:elixir|elixir]]'' was not used until the 7th century A.D. and derives from the Arabic name for miracle substances, "al iksir".  Some view it as a metaphor for the spirit of God (''e.g.'', Jesus's reference to "the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]" or "the [[Fountain of Life]]").  "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."  (John 4:14)  The [[Scottish people|Scots]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]] adopted the name for their "liquid gold": the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] name for [[whiskey]] is [[uisce beatha]], or water of life.

''Aab-i-Hayat'' is Persian and means "water of life".&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Poonawala. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-ii-water-in-muslim-iranian-culture "ĀB ii. Water in Muslim Iranian culture"].  ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]''. Retrieved 12 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Chashma-i-Kausar" (not "hasma") is the "Fountain of Bounty", which Muslims believe to be located in Paradise.  As for the Indian names, "Amrit Ras" means "immortality juice", "Maha Ras" means "great juice", and "Soma Ras" means "juice of Soma".  Soma was a psychoactive drug, by which the poets of the [[Vedas]] received their visions, but the plant is no longer known.  Later, Soma came to mean the moon.  "Ras" later came to mean "sacred mood experienced listening to poetry or music"; there are altogether nine of them.  [[Mansarovar]], the "mind lake" is  the  holy  lake at the foot  of [[Mt. Kailash]] in Tibet, close to the source of the Ganges.

== In popular culture ==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The elixir of life has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of artistic works including [[animation]], [[comics]], [[film|films]], musical compositions, [[novel|novels]], and [[video games]]. Examples include [[L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum's]] fantasy novel ''[[John Dough and the Cherub]]'', the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', the popular manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', the light novel ''[[Baccano!]]'', and the movie [[Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva]] of the popular [[Professor Layton]] franchise.

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]". Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, John. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/782/pg782.txt The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]''. Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population.

By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond. International Brief (Report No. WP/02-1)|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=July 31, 2008|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/wp02-1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Population ageing|aging population]] and its impact on [[economics]], [[politics]], [[education]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] is no longer an isolated issue but a global concern. Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

== Publications ==
An international academic journal with delayed open-access, '''''Gerontechnology''''' [http://www.gerontechjournal.net], is published by the '''International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG)''' [http://www.gerontechnology.org].

A comprehensive edited book "'''''Gerontechnology'''''" [http://www.springerpub.com/gerontechnology-9780826128881.html]has been published in 2016.

== Education ==
[[Image:SetupResearch.jpg|thumb]] The first ISG Masterclass [http://www.phe.bwk.tue.nl/ISGMasterClass/Main_mclass.htm] for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.

[[File:Fountain of Eternal Life crop.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Fountain of Eternal Life]]'' in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] is described as symbolizing "Man rising above death, reaching upward to God and toward Peace."&lt;ref name="GVCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |title=GCVM History and Mission |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=Greater Cleveland Veteran's Memorial, Inc. |date=2003 |author=Marshall Fredericks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216170723/http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Immortality''' is eternal [[life]], being exempt from [[death]], unending existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immortality|website=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immortality#Biological immortality|Some modern species]] may possess [[biological immortality]].

Certain scientists, [[futurist]]s, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that [[life extension]] is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or [[major trauma|physical trauma]]; although [[mind uploading]] could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282157696|title=Artificial Neural Command Theory(American English) (US)|last=Hentrich |first=Michael|date= September 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion|religious]] contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of [[God]] (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow [[divine law]]. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [[soul]] exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of [[religion]], as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.

==Definitions==

===Scientific===
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
[[Life extension]] technologies promise a path to complete [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. [[Cryonics]] holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] and [[Planarian|planarian worms]], it is indeed possible for a creature to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]], it is not known if it is possible for humans.

[[Mind uploading]] is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurzweil, Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology |publisher=Viking Adult |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Soul}}
The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not. The "soul" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.

==Alchemy==
{{Main|Alchemy}}
{{See also|Elixir of life|Philosopher's stone}}

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as [[cryonics]], [[digital immortality]], breakthroughs in [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] or predictions of an impending [[technological singularity]], or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] or [[Rebirthing-Breathwork|Rebirthers]].

===Causes of death===
{{Main|Death}}

There are three main causes of death: [[aging]], [[disease]] and [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayflick|first=L|title=Biological Aging is No Longer an Unsolved Problem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1100|issue=1|pages=1–13|date=2007|url=http://0-content.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/pdf19_22/pdf/2007/YQR/11Apr07/24963097.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=24963097&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr0qepq5Srqi4TLSWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvrki0ra9JuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|doi=10.1196/annals.1395.001|pmid=17460161|bibcode=2007NYASA1100....1H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,&lt;ref name="Garreau"/&gt; defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|engineered negligible senescence]]. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) ''Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair''. Academic Press, San Diego. {{ISBN|0120928604}}  {{ISBN|978-0120928606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable via [[technology]]. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of diseases functioning and disability|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human understanding of [[genetics]] is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [[Preventative medicine]] is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] may soon be curable with the use of [[stem cells]]. Breakthroughs in [[cell biology]] and [[telomere]] research are leading to treatments for [[cancer]]. [[Vaccine]]s are being researched for [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Genes associated with [[type 1 diabetes]] and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [[nervous system]] may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]] would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [[paramedic]] [[disaster relief operation|response]] remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=International Search and Rescue Teams, A League Discussion Paper |date=1991 |publisher=[[IFRC|League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] |location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [[nanotechnology]], would mitigate this factor.
Being the seat of [[consciousness]], the [[brain]] cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change ====
Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [[cumulative probability]] of death over an infinite horizon is less than [[certainty]], even when the risk of fatal trauma [[Survival analysis#Hazard function and cumulative hazard function|in any finite period]] is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving "[[Indefinite lifespan#Actuarial escape velocity|actuarial escape velocity]]"

===Biological immortality===
[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in [[rate of mortality]] as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

[[Biologist]]s have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [[Hayflick limit]], where cells no longer divide because of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [[HeLa]], developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [[Henrietta Lacks]] without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [[Leonard Hayflick]], there was the erroneous belief fostered by [[Alexis Carrel]] that all normal [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [[Telomerase]] is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name="LinKahWai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin Kah Wai |authorlink=Lin Kah Wai |title=Telomeres, Telomerase, and Tumorigenesis -- A Review |journal=MedGenMed |date=18 April 2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=19 |pmid=15520642 |pmc=1435592}}&lt;/ref&gt; No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html|title=New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals|website=nytimes.com|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biologically immortal species====
{{see also|List of longest-living organisms}}

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* ''[[Bacteria]]'' – Bacteria reproduce through [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]].

====Evolution of aging====
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}&lt;!--that's how they spell aging in England ... and in that article--&gt;
As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [[second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [[evolution]], but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999. ''A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{cite web |url=http://wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212036/http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }} About telomeres and programmed cell death.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ch. 69, Cancer cell biology and angiogenesis, Robert G. Fenton and Dan L. Longo, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* [[Pleiotropy|Antagonistic pleiotropy]] is a theory proposed as an alternative by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. ''Evolution'', '''11''':398-411. {{cite web|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. ''Nature'', '''270''': 301-304. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html] Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
There are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phytochemicals.info/abstracts/resveratrol-life-span.php |title=Resveratrol may increase life span |publisher=Phytochemicals.info |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=:: compound resveratrol may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from cancer-fighting therapies |url=http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |publisher=Wordpress.rudramani.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803231526/http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[scientist]]s believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [[telomerase]] in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [[chromosome]]s, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([[Madrid]]) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [[Hayflick limit]]. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[[Embryonic stem cells]] express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and  "swallowing the doctor"====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}

Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [[biological engineering]], [[regenerative medicine]], [[microbiology]], and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [[human cloning]], cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [[Robert Freitas]], a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [[nanorobot]]s could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=The Singularity Is Near |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Cryonics====
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]], the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [[rejuvenation (aging)|aging is reversible]]. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] which creates a glass-like state rather than [[freezing]] as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
{{Main|Mind uploading}}

One idea that has been advanced involves [[Mind uploading|uploading]] an individual's habits and memories via [[direct mind-computer interface]]. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [[Extropian]] [[futures studies|futurists]] like Moravec and [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] have proposed that, thanks to [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] computing power, it will someday be possible to [[mind uploading|upload human consciousness]] onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [[identity (social science)|identity]], thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.'' |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series=Technical Report #2008‐3 |date=2008 |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [[consciousness]] in the functions of the [[mind]]. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/iva-to/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Iva.to|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[neural correlates of consciousness]] is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}

====Cybernetics====
{{Main|Cyborg}}

Transforming a human into a [[cyborg]] can include [[brain implants]] or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

====Digital immortality====
{{Main|Digital immortality}}

==Religious views==
{{Main|Afterlife|Soul}}
As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the ''[[A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas|Syntopicon]]'' found in their compilation of the [[Great Books of the Western World]], that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 788"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=788 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the [[afterlife]].

===Ancient Greek religion===
Immortality in [[ancient Greek religion]] originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [[Elysium]], the [[Islands of the Blessed]], heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were [[Amphiaraus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Iphigenia]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuce]], the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]] were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], the 7th century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a belief first appearing with either [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] or the [[Orphics]], and most importantly advocated by [[Plato]] and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of [[Jesus]] was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say&amp;nbsp;... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21).

===Buddhism===
The goal of [[Hinayana]] is [[Arhatship]] and [[Nirvana]].  By contrast, the goal of [[Mahayana]] is [[Buddhahood]].

According to one [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching, [[Dzogchen]], individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the [[rainbow body]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Eternal life (Christianity)|Christian conditionalism|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 3.jpg|thumb|Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''Danse Macabre'', 16th century]]

[[Christianity|Christian theology]] holds that [[Adam and Eve]] lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the [[Fall of man]], although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 784"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=784 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians who profess the [[Nicene Creed]] believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected from the dead]] at the [[Second Coming]], and this belief is known as [[Universal resurrection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[N.T. Wright]], a theologian and former [[Bishop of Durham]], has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [[Time (magazine)|Time]]: "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [[Second Coming of Christ|his return]]. Part of this will be the [[Universal resurrection|resurrection of all the dead]], who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Chiranjivi|Naraka (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing ''punarjanma''. Illustration from ''Hinduism Today'', 2004]]

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe in an immortal soul which is [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called ''[[samsara]]''. If they live their life well, their ''[[karma]]'' improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are explicit renderings in the [[Upanishad]]s alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp 94-95 (v 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life&amp;nbsp;... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"/&gt;

An Indian Tamil saint known as [[Vallalar]] claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallalar.org |title=vallalar.org |publisher=vallalar.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Fabled East: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y1RgQC-hw1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Vallalar+immortality+1874#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallalar%20immortality%201874&amp;f=false|author=Adam Schroeder|publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|D &amp; M Publishers]]|page=174|isbn=9781553656159|date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
Sikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to  earth as they please to help the world a better place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/sikhs-soul-lives-on-body-dies_n_1763220.html|title=For Sikhs, The Soul Lives On Long After The Body Dies|last=Burke|first=Daniel|date=2012-10-08|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{primary sources|date=June 2015}}
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian Exile]], but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]]. Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] speaks about ''[[Sheol]]'' (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the [[Resurrection of the dead#Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism|resurrection of the dead]]. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1–4|ESV}} although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [[intertestamental period]].

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [[Second Temple Period]]. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” &lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [[Messianic Age]] with the coming of the [[messiah in Judaism|messiah]]. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [[Tanakh]] is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Taoism===
{{See also|Chinese alchemy|Taoism and death|Xian (Taoism)}}

It is repeatedly stated in [[Lüshi Chunqiu]] that death is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creel|first=Herrlee G.|title=What is Taoism? : and other studies in Chinese cultural history|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226120478|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Maspero]] noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a ''way of life'' than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. Taoism: Growth of a Religion (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]), p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Legge, James. The Texts of Taoism. 1962, Dover Press. NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrian]]s believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [[Iranian calendar]] (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [[Ameretat]] is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727145155/http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |date=2017-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
[[Alcmaeon of Croton]] argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.&lt;ref name="alcmaeon"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.

* The [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]] explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.

* The [[Phaedo#The Affinity Argument|Affinity Argument]], explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The [[Phaedo#The Argument from Form of Life|Argument from Form of Life]], or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
[[Plotinus]] offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [[Simple (philosophy)|simple]], then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s [[Phaedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, D. (2008) "The Neoplatonic Achilles" in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metochites===
[[Theodore Metochites]] argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.&lt;ref name="metochites"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[Avicenna]] argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shifâ’, Al-Ilâhiyyât, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, Organisme Général des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431–2; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destinée de l’homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22–56, and particularly pp. 26–27, and 43; J. Janssens, “Ibn Sînâ's Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur’ân as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259–261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Rozemond, M. (2010). "Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
In early work, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [[monadology]] he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses Mendelssohn===
[[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Phaedon]]'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, B. (2008). "Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the ‘I Think’ ".in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{See also|Life extension#Ethics and politics of life extension}}

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [[persistent vegetative state]]s, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [[Human enhancement#Inequality and Social Disruption|social and economic]] disparities created by [[longevity]], and survival of the [[heat death of the universe]].

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story "The Mortal Immortal", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story "[[The Immortal (short story)|The Immortal]]"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book ''Thursday's Fictions'', and the stage and film adaptations of it, [[Richard James Allen]] tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poems-book/thursday-s-fictions-0371000|title=Thursday's Fictions - Richard James Allen - Poems by book - Australian Poetry Library|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the novel ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'' depicts immortality as "falling off the wheel of life" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime ''[[Casshern Sins]]'' humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In [[Anne Rice]]'s book series ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', [[vampire]]s are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.

In his book ''Death'', Yale philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''Death''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238-46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] shapes their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81-87. 7p. (editorial) ISSN 1550-8307 {{PMID|28108110}}, Database: CINAHL Complete]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [[demographic shift]] of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Goodkind, Kowal|first1=Wan, Daniel, Paul|title=An Aging World: 2015|journal=International Population Reports: U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2016|volume=1|issue=16|page=1–30|url=census.gov|accessdate=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php|title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science|website=Fight Aging!|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Ankh-Symbol.svg|right|thumb|80px|The ankh]]

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [[ankh]] is an [[Egypt]]ian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [[:Category:Egyptian deities|gods]] and [[pharaoh]]s, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of a [[trefoil knot]] is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [[Ouroboros]], the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ''ten'' [[kanji]], the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the [[peacock]] in Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/peacock.htm |author=Wilson, Ralph F. |title=Peacock as an Ancient Christian Symbol of Eternal Life |publisher=Jesus Walk Bible Study Series |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the colors [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (in [[Western culture]]) and [[Peach (color)|peach]] (in [[Chinese culture]]).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Immortality in fiction}}
Immortality is a popular subject in [[fiction]], as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.&lt;ref name="Garreau"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Garreau |authorlink=Joel Garreau |title=The Invincible Man |date=October 31, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/30/AR2007103002222_pf.html |pages=C01 |journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102231840/http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |archivedate=2012-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuerpo Incorrupto de La Siervita de Dios.jpg|thumb|400px|The body of [[Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado]], Monastery of St. Catherine of Siena found to be incorrupt by the Catholic Church ([[Tenerife]], [[Spain]]).]]
'''Incorruptibility''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] belief that divine intervention allows some human bodies (specifically [[saint]]s and [[Beatification|beati]]) to avoid the normal process of [[decomposition]] after death as a sign of their holiness. Bodies that undergo little or no decomposition, or delayed decomposition, are sometimes referred to as ''incorrupt'' or ''incorruptible''.

Incorruptibility is thought to occur even in the presence of factors which normally hasten decomposition, as in the cases of saints [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Julie Billiart]] and [[Francis Xavier]].&lt;ref name="Quigley"&gt;{{cite book | last = Quigley| first = Christine| title =The Corpse: A History| publisher = McFarland| year = 2005| page = 254| isbn =978-0786424498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholicism==
In [[Roman Catholicism]], if a body is judged as incorruptible after death, this is generally seen as a sign that the individual is a [[saint]]. [[Canon law]] allows inspection of the body so that relics can be taken and sent to Rome. The relics must be sealed with wax and the body must be replaced after inspection. These ritual inspections are performed very rarely and can only be performed by a bishop respecting canon law. A pontifical commission can authorize inspection of the relics and demand a written report.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/print49948.htm The Re-Vesting of the Relics of St. John of Shanghai &amp; San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; After solemn inspection of the relics, it can be decided that the body is presented in an open reliquary and displayed for veneration. Catholic law allows saints to be buried under the altar, so Mass can be celebrated above the corpse.

The relics of Saint [[Bernadette Soubirous|Bernadette]] were inspected multiple times, and reports by the church tribunal confirmed that the body was preserved. The opening of the reliquary was attended by multiple canons, the mayor and the bishop in 1919, and repeated in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicpilgrims.com/lourdes/bb_bernadette_body.htm|title=The Body of Saint Bernadette|author=|date=|website=www.catholicpilgrims.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every saint, however, is expected to have an incorruptible corpse. Although incorruptibility is recognized as supernatural, it is no longer counted as a miracle in the recognition of a saint.&lt;ref name="discover"&gt;Archived at [https://archive.is/20010610014402/http://www.discover.com/june_01/featsaints.html The Incorruptibles], ''The bodies of many medieval Catholic saints and martyrs have resisted decay for centuries— just the sort of mystery that begs for scientific inquiry'', By [[Heather Pringle]], ''Discover'' Vol. 22 No. 6 (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Embalmed]] bodies were not recognized as incorruptibles. For example, although the body of [[Pope John XXIII]] remained in a remarkably intact state after its exhumation, Church officials remarked that the body had been embalmed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandri |first=Luigi |title=Blessed John XXIII's Remains Are Now On View At St Peter's |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |website=Christianity Today |accessdate=11 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NIPsDkFx?url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/juneweb-only/6-11-13.0.html?paging=off |archivedate=11 February 2014 |date=1 June 2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally there was a lack of oxygen in his sealed triple coffin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Incorruptibility is seen as distinct from the good preservation of a body, or from [[Mummy|mummification]]. Incorruptible bodies are often said to have the [[odour of sanctity]], exuding a sweet or [[Flower|floral]], pleasant aroma.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
[[File:Anthony, John, and Eustathios in Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius-2.jpg|upright|thumb|Relics of [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]] at the [[Orthodox Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius]], Lithuania.]]
To the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], a distinction is made between natural mummification and what is believed to be supernatural incorruptibility. While incorruptibility is not generally deemed to be a prerequisite for sainthood, there are a great number of eastern Orthodox saints whose bodies have been found to be incorrupt and are in much veneration among the faithful. These include:
* [[Anthony, John, and Eustathios]]
* [[Saint Alexander of Svir]] – the incorrupt relics of the saint were removed from the Svir Monastery by the Bolsheviks on December 20, 1918, after several unsuccessful attempts to confiscate them. Finally, the holy relics were sent to Petrograd's Military Medical Academy. There they remained for nearly eighty years. A second uncovering of St Alexander's relics took place in December 1997, before their return to the Svir Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theorthodoxword.com/back%20articles/OW%20PDFs/236/A%20Brief%20Life%20of%20St%20Alexander%20of%20Svir.pdf The Marvelous Wonderworker of All Russia, Holy Venerable Alexander of Svir.

* [[Saint Job of Pochayiv]]
* [[Saint John the Russian]]
* [[Ioasaph of Belgorod|Saint Ioasaph of Belgorod]] – In 1918 the Bolsheviks removed Saint Ioasaph's relics from his shrine in the cathedral of the Holy Trinity at Belgorod, and for some seventy years, their whereabouts remained unknown. In 1927, the cathedral itself was demolished. In the late 1980s, the relics were discovered in [[Leningrad]]'s Museum of Religion and Atheism, and on 16 September 1991, they were solemnly returned to the new Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord in Belgorod, in the presence of [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/nm/duga/sec041.htm ST.

During marble excavations on the [[Appian Way]] in Spring 1485, workers found three marble coffins. In one, twelve feet underground, was the corpse of a young woman, said to have looked as if it had been buried that day, despite being about 1500 years old. The corpse attracted 20,000 plus crowds of spectators in the first few days, many of whom believed it to be of [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia, daughter of Cicero]], whose epitaph was on one of the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqroj_IS9rwC&amp;pg=PT199&amp;lpg=PT199&amp;ots=SbdGUVuziC&amp;focus=viewport Translated letters about tombs on Appian Way, from ''Pagan and Christian Rome'' by Rodolfo Lanciani, 1896]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Kouvola]], Finland, he studied at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref name="bej"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feather|first1=Leonard|last2=Gitler|first2=Ira|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195320008|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4EjDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing professionally at the end of the 1950s. He played in a sextet led by [[Heikki Rosendahl]] during that time, and then studied flute performance at the [[Sibelius Academy]] and in the U.S. at the [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref name="New Grove" /&gt; Moving back to Finland, he settled in [[Helsinki]] and began working both as a [[session musician]] and with [[jazz fusion|fusion]] groups. Later in the 1960s he formed a duo with [[Edward Vesala]], as well as in the group [[Eero Koivistoinen]] for four years. He played with [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] in their earlier days, including for their first, eponymous, album. He recorded with [[Thad Jones]] and [[Mel Lewis]] and with [[Heikki Sarmanto]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and his first album as a soloist, ''Etiquette'', was released in 1974.

In 1975, he became a member of the [[New Music Orchestra]], and worked with the [[Nordic All Stars]], [[Arild Andersen]], and [[Peter Brötzmann]] later in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="RCJE"/&gt; The 1980s saw him working with the [[UFO Big Band]], [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Charlie Mariano]], and others. He was granted a 15-year state grant from Finland in the mid-1980s. In 1983 he rejoined Tasavallan Presidentti, and has recorded and toured with them since. He led a touring quartet from 1990 to 1992 with [[Olli Ahvenlahti]], [[Heikki Virtanen]] and [[Reino Laine]]. Aaltonen and [[Heikki Sarmanto]] released a duo recording, ''Rise'', in 2001; in 2003 Aaltonen's trio album ''Mother Tongue'' won a Jazz-Emma in Finland. Aaltonen continues to teach at the annual [[Nilsiä]] Music Camp.

The '''last universal common ancestor''' ('''LUCA'''), also called the '''last universal ancestor''' ('''LUA'''),  '''cenancestor''', or (incorrectly&lt;ref group=R&gt;There is a common misconception that definitions of LUCA and progenote are the same; however, progenote is defined as an organism “still in the process of evolving the relationship between genotype and phenotype”, and it is only hypothesed that LUCA is a progenote.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gogarten|first1=Johann Peter|last2=Deamer|first2=David|title=Is LUCA a thermophilic progenote?|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=1|date=25 November 2016|page=16229|doi=10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.229}}&lt;/ref&gt;) '''progenote''', is the most recent population of organisms from which all organisms now [[Life|living on Earth]] have a [[common descent]].&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theobald DL |title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=219–22 |date=May 2010  |pmid=20463738 |doi=10.1038/nature09014 |bibcode=2010Natur.465..219T}}&lt;/ref&gt; LUCA is the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all current life on Earth. LUCA is not thought to be the [[first living organism on Earth]], but only one of many early organisms, whereas the others became extinct. 

While there is no specific fossil evidence of LUCA, it can be studied by [[phylogenetic bracketing|comparing the genomes of its descendants]], all organisms living today. By this means, a 2016 study identified a set of 355 [[gene]]s inferred to have been present in LUCA. This would imply it was already a complex life form with many [[co-adapted]] features, including [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]] mechanisms to convert information between [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725" /&gt; However, some of those genes could have developed later and spread universally by [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="GogartenDeamer2016" /&gt;

LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the [[Paleoarchean]] [[era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Doolittle WF|date=February 2000|title=Uprooting the tree of life|journal=Scientific American|volume=282|issue=2|pages=90–95|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90|pmid=10710791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Glansdorff N, Xu Y, Labedan B|year=2008|title=The last universal common ancestor: emergence, constitution and genetic legacy of an elusive forerunner|journal=Biology Direct|volume=3|issue=|page=29|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-29|pmc=2478661|pmid=18613974}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few hundred million years after the [[Earliest known life forms|earliest evidence of life on Earth]], for which there are several candidates.

[[Charles Darwin]] proposed the theory of universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process in his book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, saying, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{Citation |last=Darwin |first=C. |year=1859 |title=[[The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]] |page=490 |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biologists have separated the problem of the [[origin of life]] from that of the LUCA.

==Features==
{{further information|Phylogenetic bracketing}}

By [[phylogenetic bracketing|analysis of the presumed LUCA's offspring groups]], the LUCA appears to have been a small, single-celled organism. It likely had a ring-shaped coil of [[DNA]] floating freely within the cell, like modern [[bacteria]]. Morphologically, it would likely not have stood out within a mixed population of small modern-day bacteria. However, [[Carl Woese]] ''et al.'', who first proposed the currently-used [[Three-domain system|three domain system]] based on an analysis of &lt;!--the 16S --&gt;[[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) sequences of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, stated that in its genetic machinery, the LUCA would have been a "...simpler, more rudimentary entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three [domains] (and their descendants)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/87/12/4576 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1990 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=2112744 |pages=4576–79 |volume=87 |issue=12 |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 |first=C.

While the gross anatomy of LUCA can only be reconstructed with much uncertainty, its biochemical mechanisms can be described in some detail, based on the properties currently shared by all independently living organisms on Earth.&lt;ref name=W1998&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wächtershäuser |first1=Günter |year=1998 |title=Towards a Reconstruction of Ancestral Genomes by Gene Cluster Alignment |journal=Systematic and Applied Microbiology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=473–74, IN1, 475–77 |doi=10.1016/S0723-2020(98)80058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/Life/life.htm |title=What is Life? |first=Michael |last=Gregory |publisher=Clinton College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20071213110350/http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/Michael.Gregory/files/Bio%20101/Bio%20101%20Lectures/Life/life.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pace NR |title=The universal nature of biochemistry |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=805–08 |date=January 2001  |pmid=11158550 |pmc=33372 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wächtershäuser, G. |title=From pre-cells to Eukarya – a tale of two lipids |journal=Molecular Microbiology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=13–22 |date=January 2003  |pmid=12492850 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03267.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genetic code]] was most likely based on DNA,&lt;ref name="PiP"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Patterns In Palaeontology: The first 3 billion years of evolution |first=Russell J. |last=Garwood |year=2012 |journal=Palaeontology Online |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=1–14 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2012/patterns-in-palaeontology-the-first-3-billion-years-of-evolution/ |accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some studies suggest that LUCA may have been defined wholly through [[RNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael  |last=Marshall |title=Life began with a planetary mega-organism
|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228404-300-life-began-with-a-planetary-mega-organism/
 |publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If DNA was present, it was composed exclusively of four [[nucleotide]]s: [[deoxyadenosine]], [[deoxycytidine]], [[deoxythymidine]], and [[deoxyguanosine]]. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent [[enzyme]], [[DNA polymerase]]. The integrity of the DNA benefited from a group of maintenance and  [[DNA repair|repair]] enzymes including [[DNA topoisomerase]] and [[DNA ligase]]. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as [[histone]]s. The genetic code was composed of 64 three-nucleotide [[codons]] which redundantly coded for 20 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;
If the code was DNA-based, its genetic code was expressed via single-stranded RNA intermediates. The RNA was produced by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] using nucleotides similar to those of DNA, with the exception that the DNA nucleotide [[thymidine]] was replaced by [[uridine]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The genetic code was expressed into [[protein]]s. These were assembled from free [[amino acid]]s by [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of a [[messenger RNA]] via a mechanism of [[ribosome]]s, [[transfer RNA]]s, and a group of related proteins. The ribosomes were composed of two subunits, a big [[50S]] and a small [[30S]].  Each ribosomal subunit was composed of a core of ribosomal RNA surrounded by [[ribosomal protein]]s. Both types of RNA molecules (ribosomal and transfer RNAs) played an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes. Only 20 [[amino acids]] were used, only in [[Chirality (chemistry)|L-isomers]], to the exclusion of countless other amino acids. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] served as an energy intermediate. Several hundred protein [[enzymes]] catalyzed chemical reactions to extract energy from fats, sugars, and amino acids, and to synthesize fats, sugars, amino acids, and nucleic acid bases through various chemical pathways.&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;

The cell contained a water-based cytoplasm effectively enclosed by a lipid bilayer membrane. The cell tended to exclude [[sodium]] and concentrate [[potassium]] by means of specific [[ion transporter]]s (or ion pumps). The cell multiplied by duplicating all its contents followed by [[cellular division]].&lt;ref name=W1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=W2003/&gt;
The cell used [[chemiosmosis]] to produce energy. It also reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and oxidized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[methanogenesis]] or [[acetogenesis]]) via [[acetyl]]-[[thioester]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin, W. |author2=Russell, M.J. |title=On the origin of biochemistry at an alkaline hydrothermal vent |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in which he twice stated the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms. In the summation he states, "Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray, Albermarle Street. 1859. pp. 484, 490.&lt;/ref&gt; The very last sentence begins with a restatement of the hypothesis: "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one..."&lt;ref name="Darwin, Charles 1859. Pg. 484"/&gt;

When the LUCA was hypothesized, [[cladogram]]s based on [[genetic distance]] between living cells indicated that [[Archaea]] split early from the rest of life. This was inferred from the fact that the archaeans known at that time were highly resistant to environmental extremes such as high [[salinity]], [[temperature]] or acidity, leading some scientists to suggest that the LUCA evolved in areas like the [[black smoker|deep ocean vents]], where such extremes prevail today. Archaea, however, were later discovered in less hostile environments, and are now believed to be more closely related to the [[Eukaryota]] than to the [[Bacteria]], although many details are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Xie, Q. |author2=Wang, Y. |author3=Lin, J. |author4=Qin, Y. |author5=Wang, Y. |author6=Bu, W. |title=Potential key bases of ribosomal RNA to kingdom-specific spectra of antibiotic susceptibility and the possible archaeal origin of eukaryotes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e29468 |year=2012 |pmid=22247777 |pmc=3256160 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029468|bibcode=2012PLoSO...729468X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yutin, N. |author2=Makarova K.S. |author3=Mekhedov S.L. |author4=Wolf, Y.I. |author5=Koonin, E.V. |title=The deep archaeal roots of eukaryotes |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=1619–30 |date=August 2008  |pmid=18463089 |pmc=2464739 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic biochemical principles make it overwhelmingly likely that all organisms do have a single common ancestor. It is extremely unlikely that organisms descended from separate incidents of cell-formation would be able to complete a horizontal gene transfer without garbling each other's genes, converting them into [[Noncoding DNA|noncoding segments]]. Further, many more amino acids are chemically possible than the twenty found in modern protein molecules. These lines of chemical evidence, incorporated into the formal statistical test point to a single cell having been the LUCA. While the test overwhelmingly favored the existence of a single LUCA, this does not imply that the LUCA was ever alone: instead, it was one of many early microbes&lt;ref name="theobald"/&gt; but the only one whose descendents survived beyond the [[Paleoarchean|Paleoarchean Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egel|first1=Richard|title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life|journal=Life|date=March 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=170–212|doi=10.3390/life2010170|pmc=4187143|pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the later gene pool of the LUCA's descendants, with their common framework of the [[Chargaff's rules|AT/GC]] rule and the standard twenty amino acids, horizontal gene transfer would have been feasible and could have been very common.

In an earlier hypothesis, [[Carl Woese]] (1988) had proposed that: (1) no individual organism can be considered a LUCA, and (2) the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through [[horizontal gene transfer]] among an ancient community of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woese C |title=The universal ancestor |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6854–59 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9618502 |pmc=22660 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6854 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6854W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the results described by Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, Woese's argument can still be applied to Ur-organisms (initial products of abiogenesis) before the LUCA. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code had not evolved.&lt;ref name="majortransinevolution"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Major Transitions in Evolution | last=Maynard Smith | first=John | authorlink=John Maynard Smith |first2=Eörs |last2=Szathmáry |author2link=Eörs Szathmáry | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1995 | location=Oxford, England | isbn=0-19-850294-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGCmIVB5dhMC}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. However, the LUCA lived after the origin of the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading.

Ground-breaking research by [[William F.

[[File:MeaningAndPurpose.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Meaning and Purpose''''', written by [[Kenneth Walker (author)|Kenneth Walker]], was first published in September 1944 by [[Jonathan Cape]], London, and republished by Pelican books in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pelican Books#Pelican books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the book, as stated in the preface, was "... to examine critically those scientific theories of the last hundred years which have exerted a strong influence on our thinking, not so much for the purpose of assessing their worth as for that of discovering the effect which they have had on our philosophy of life."

The book detailed an alternative perception of life and reality. It offered arguments proposing that neither [[Charles Darwin]] nor religious [[creationism]] adequately described the event of life, intellect, consciousness and various other concepts.

The first chapter opened with a discussion of a passage quoted from [[Goethe]], there described as a poet, philosopher and scientist. Others whose writings as prominent scientists were listed in the book's bibliography were Sir [[Arthur Eddington]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], Sir [[Julian Huxley]], Sir [[James Jeans]] and [[A. N. Whitehead]].

A hostile review in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/LabourMonthly-1950dec-00570&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that the book referred unfavourably to Karl Marx as never to be regarded as having been a profound thinker and concluded that it was "by a superficial man serving reactionary purposes".

[[File:Frog in frogspawn.jpg|right|thumb|A [[frog]] in [[frog#Eggs / frogspawn|frogspawn]]]]
In [[biology]], '''offspring''' are the young born of living [[organism]]s, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of [[sexual reproduction]], two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a '''brood''' or '''progeny''' in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the [[bird|chicks]] hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the [[brood (honeybee)|honeybee]].

Human offspring ([[kinship and descent|descendants]]) are referred to as [[child]]ren (without reference to age, thus one can refer to a parent's "[[minor (law)|minor]] children" or "[[adult]] children" or "[[infant|infant children]]" or "[[Teenagers|teenage children]]" depending on their age); male children are [[son]]s and female children are [[daughter]]s (see [[kinship and descent]]). Offspring can occur after mating or after [[artificial insemination]].

Offspring contains many parts and properties that are precise and accurate in what they consist of, and what they define. As the offspring of a new species, also known as a child or f1 generation, consist of genes of the father and the mother, which is also known as the parent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these offspring contains numerous genes which have coding for specific tasks and properties. Males and females both contribute equally to the genotypes of their offspring, in which gametes fuse and form. An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome, which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To focus more on the offspring and how it results in the formation of the f1 generation, is an inheritance called sex-linkage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a gene which is located on the sex chromosome and patterns of these inheritance differ in both male and female. The explanation that proves the theory of the offspring having genes from both parent generations, is proven through a process called crossing-over, which consists of taking genes from the male chromosomes and genes from the female chromosome, resulting in a process of [[meiosis]] occurring, and leading to the splitting of the chromosomes evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on which genes are dominantly expressed in the gene will result in the sex of the offspring. The female will always give an X chromosome, whereas the male, depending on the situation, will either give an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. If a male offspring is produced, the gene will consist of an X and a Y chromosome. If two X chromosomes are expressed and produced, it produces a female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is the production of an offspring which represents the identical genes as its parent. Reproductive cloning begins with the removal of the nucleus from an egg, which holds the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to clone an organ, a stem cell is to be produced and then utilized to clone that specific organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception of cloning is that it produces an exact copy of the parent being cloned. Cloning copies the DNA/genes of the parent and then creates a genetic duplicate. The clone will not be a similar copy as he or she will grow up in different surroundings from the parent and may encounter different opportunities and experiences. Although mostly positive, cloning also faces some setbacks in terms of ethics and human health. Though cell division and DNA replication is a vital part of survival, there are many steps involved and mutations can occur with permanent change in an organism's and their offspring's DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnemstudio.org/genetic-algorithms-mutation.htm|title=mutation|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutations can be good as they result in random evolution periods in which may be good for the species, but most mutations are bad as they can change the genotypes of offspring, which can result in changes that harm the species.

[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus|The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher's Stone]]'' by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], 1771.]]

The '''philosopher's stone''', or '''stone of the philosophers''' ({{lang-la|lapis philosophorum}}) is a legendary [[alchemy|alchemical]] substance capable of turning [[base metal]]s such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] into [[gold]] ({{Lang|grc-Latn|[[chrysopoeia]]}}, from the Greek χρυσός ''khrusos'', "gold", and ποιεῖν ''poiēin'', "to make") or silver. It is also called the [[elixir of life]], useful for [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] and for achieving [[immortality]]; for many centuries, it was the most sought goal in [[alchemy]]. The philosopher's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy, symbolizing perfection at its finest, [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], and heavenly bliss. Efforts to discover the philosopher's stone were known as the [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|Magnum Opus]] ("Great Work").&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]], ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/frc/frceng01.htm Freemasonry and Catholicism]'', {{ISBN|0-911274-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient Greece===
Mention of the philosopher's stone in writing can be found as far back as ''Cheirokmeta'' by [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. 300 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ede, Lesley B. Cormack. ''A History of Science in Society: from philosophy to utility.'' University of Toronto Press. p .66&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers assign a longer history. [[Elias Ashmole]] and the anonymous author of ''Gloria Mundi'' (1620) claim that its history goes back to [[Adam]] who acquired the knowledge of the stone directly from God. This knowledge was said to be passed down through biblical patriarchs, giving them their longevity. The legend of the stone was also compared to the biblical history of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the rejected cornerstone described in [[Psalm 118]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book'' Princeton University Press, 1995. p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical roots outlining the stone’s creation can be traced to Greek philosophy. Alchemists later used the [[classical element]]s, the concept of [[anima mundi]], and Creation stories presented in texts like Plato's [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] as analogies for their process.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge University Press. 2003. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or [[prima materia]] (first matter), associated with [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. ''Prima materia'' is also the name alchemists assign to the starting ingredient for the creation of the philosopher's stone. The importance of this philosophical first matter persisted throughout the history of alchemy. In the seventeenth century, [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] writes, "the first matter of the stone is the very same with the first matter of all things".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Haeffner. Dictionary of Alchemy: From Maria Prophetessa to Isaac Newton. Karnac Books, 2004. p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval alchemists built upon the work of Zosimos in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Arab empires. Byzantine and Arab alchemists were fascinated by the concept of metal transmutation and attempted to carry out the process.&lt;ref name="Strohmaier"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Umara ibn Hamza, Constantine V, and the invention of the elixir|page=147-150|last1=Strohmaier|first1=Gotthard|title=Hellas im Islam: Interdisziplinare Studien zur Ikonographie, Wissenschaft und Religionsgeschichte|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783447046374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th-century [[Muslim]] alchemist [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] ([[Latin]]ized as ''Geber'') analyzed each classical element in terms of the four basic qualities. Fire was both hot and dry, earth cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air hot and moist. He theorized that every metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them interior and two exterior. From this premise, it was reasoned that the transmutation of one metal into another could be affected by the rearrangement of its basic qualities. This change would be mediated by a substance, which came to be called ''xerion'' in Greek and ''al-iksir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (from which the word ''[[elixir]]'' is derived). It was often considered to exist as a dry red powder (also known as ''al-kibrit al-ahmar'', red sulfur) made from a legendary stone—the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Philosopher's Stone: Alchemy and Chemistry|first=Jehane|last=Ragai|journal=Journal of Comparative Poetics|volume=12|issue=Metaphor and Allegory in the Middle Ages|year=1992|pages=58–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutbatu'l-Hakim|first=E. J.|last=Holmyard|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=6|issue=3|year=1924|pages=293–305|doi=10.1086/358238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elixir powder came to be regarded as a crucial component of transmutation by later Arab alchemists.&lt;ref name="Strohmaier" /&gt;

In the 11th century, there was a debate among [[Muslim world]] chemists on whether the transmutation of substances was possible. A leading opponent was the Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina), who discredited the theory of transmutation of substances, stating, "Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the 13th-century scientist and philosopher [[Albertus Magnus]] is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone. Magnus does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by "transmutation".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn and Frederick E. Budd. ''A Survey of the Occult.'' Electric Book Company. 2001. p. 28-30. {{ISBN|1-84327-087-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance to early modern period===
[[File:Squaredcircle.svg|thumb|The Squared Circle: an [[alchemical symbol]] (17th century) illustrating the interplay of the four [[Classical element|elements]] of matter symbolising the philosopher's stone]]
The 16th-century Swiss alchemist [[Paracelsus]] (''Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim'') believed in the existence of [[alkahest]], which he thought to be an undiscovered element from which all other elements (earth, fire, water, air) were simply derivative forms. Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher's stone.

The English philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]] in his spiritual testament ''[[Religio Medici]]'' (1643) identified the religious aspect of the quest for the philosopher's Stone when declaring:
 
{{quote|The smattering I have of the Philosophers stone, (which is something more than the perfect exaltation of gold) hath taught me a great deale of Divinity.|(R.M.Part 1:38)&lt;ref&gt;The Major Works ed C.A. Patrides Penguin 1977&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A mystical text published in the 17th century called the ''[[Mutus Liber]]'' appears to be a symbolic instruction manual for concocting a philosopher's stone. Called the "wordless book", it was a collection of 15 illustrations.

===In Buddhism and Hinduism===
{{main|Cintamani}}
The equivalent of the philosopher's stone in [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] is the ''Cintamani''.&lt;ref&gt;[[René Guénon|Guénon, René]] (2004) (1962). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEQQht2Y2CQC Symbols of Sacred Science]''. Sophia Perennis, USA. {{ISBN|0-900588-78-0}}. pp. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to&lt;ref&gt;DICTIONARY.COM&lt;/ref&gt; as Paras/Parasmani ([[Hindi]]: पारस/पारसमणि) or Paris ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: परिस).

In Mahayana Buddhism, ''Chintamani'' is held by the [[bodhisattva]]s, [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Ksitigarbha]]. It is also seen carried upon the back of the [[Lung ta]] (wind horse) which is depicted on Tibetan [[Prayer flag#Symbols and prayers|prayer flags]]. By reciting the [[Dharani]] of Chintamani, Buddhist tradition maintains that one attains the Wisdom of Buddhas, is able to understand the truth of the Buddhas, and turns afflictions into [[Bodhi]]. It is said to allow one to see the Holy Retinue of [[Amitabha]] and his assembly upon one's deathbed. In Tibetan Buddhist tradition the Chintamani is sometimes depicted as a luminous pearl and is in the possession of several of different forms of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Donkin, ''Beyond price: pearls and pearl-fishing : origins to the Age of Discoveries'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=leHFqMQ9mw8C&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Hinduism it is connected with the gods [[Vishnu]] and [[Ashtavinayak#Shri Chintamani|Ganesha]]. In Hindu tradition it is often depicted as a fabulous jewel in the possession of the [[Nāga]] king or as on the forehead of the [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'', originally written in the 10th century AD, contains a story about the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concise Yoga Vasistha |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |first=Swami |last=Venkatesananda |authorlink=Swami Venkatesananda |year=1984 |isbn=0-87395-955-8 |oclc=11044869 |pages=346–353 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FFdOj2dv8cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A great Hindu sage wrote about the spiritual accomplishment of [[Gnosis]] using the metaphor of the philosopher's stone. Saint [[Dnyaneshwar|Jnaneshwar]] (1275–1296) wrote a commentary with 17 references to the philosopher's stone that explicitly transmutes base metal into gold. The seventh century [[Siddhar]] [[Tirumular|Thirumoolar]] in his classic ''Tirumandhiram'' explains man's path to immortal divinity. In verse 2709 he declares that the name of God, [[Shiva]] is an alchemical vehicle that turns the body into immortal gold.

==Properties==
The most commonly mentioned properties are the ability to transmute base metals into gold or silver, and the ability to heal all forms of illness and prolong the life of any person who consumes a small part of the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Theophrastus Paracelsus. ''The Book of the Revelation of Hermes''. 16th century&lt;/ref&gt; Other mentioned properties include: creation of perpetually burning lamps,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; transmutation of common crystals into precious stones and diamonds,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; reviving of dead plants,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; creation of flexible or malleable glass,&lt;ref&gt;An unknown German Sage. ''A Very Brief Tract Concerning the Philosophical Stone''. (unknown date, possibly 16th century)&lt;/ref&gt; or the creation of a clone or [[homunculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Theophrastus Paracelsus. ''Of the Nature of Things''. 16th century&lt;/ref&gt;

===Names===
Numerous synonyms were used to make oblique reference to the stone, such as "white stone" (''calculus albus'', identified with the ''calculus candidus'' of Revelation 2:17 which was taken as a symbol of the glory of heaven&lt;ref&gt;Salomon Glass, Johann Gottfried Olearius, ''Philologia sacra: qua totius Vet. et Novi Testamenti Scripturae tum stylus et litteratura, tum sensus et genuinae interpretationis ratio et doctrina libris V expenditur ac traditur'' ^, imp. J. Fred. Gleditschius (1743)&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[vitriol]]'' (as expressed in the [[backronym]] ''Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem''), also ''lapis noster'', ''lapis occultus'', ''in water at the box'', and numerous oblique, mystical or mythological references such as ''[[Adam]], Aer, Animal, Alkahest, Antidotus, [[Antimony|Antimonium]], Aqua benedicta, Aqua volans per aeram, [[wikt:arcanum|Arcanum]], Atramentum, Autumnus, Basilicus, Brutorum cor, Bufo, Capillus, Capistrum auri, Carbones, [[Cerberus]], [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], Cinis cineris, [[Crocus]], Dominus philosophorum, Divine quintessence, Draco elixir, Filius ignis, Fimus, Folium, Frater, Granum, Granum frumenti, Haematites, Hepar, Herba, Herbalis, Lac, Melancholia, Ovum philosophorum, Panacea salutifera, [[Pandora]], [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], Philosophic mercury, Pyrites, Radices arboris solares, Regina, Rex regum, Sal metallorum, Salvator terrenus, Talcum, Thesaurus, Ventus hermetis''.&lt;ref&gt;listed e.g. in W. Schneider, ''Lexikon alchemistisch-pharmazeutischer Symbole'', Weinheim 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the medieval allegories for a Christ were adopted for the ''lapis'', and the Christ and the Stone were indeed taken as identical in a mystical sense. The name of "Stone" or ''lapis'' itself is informed by early Christian allegory, such as [[Priscillian]] (4th century), who stated ''Unicornis est Deus, nobis petra Christus, nobis lapis angularis Jesus, nobis hominum homo Christus''.&lt;ref&gt;''Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum '' t. XVIII, p. 24, cited by C. G. Jung in ''Roots of Consciousness''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts it is simply called 'stone', or our stone, or in the case of [[Thomas Norton (alchemist)|Thomas Norton's]] Ordinal, "oure delycious stone".&lt;ref&gt;Line 744 in Thomas Norton's The Ordinal of Alchemy by John Rediry. The Early English Text Society no. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone was frequently praised and referred to in such terms.

It needs to be noted that ''philosophorum'' does not mean "of the philosopher" or "the philosopher's" in the sense of a single philosopher. It means "of the philosophers" in the sense of a plurality of philosophers.

===Appearance===
[[File:Michael Maier Atalanta Fugiens Emblem 21.jpeg|thumb|Philosopher's stone as pictured in ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' Emblem 21]]
[[File:The First Key of Basil Valentine. Wellcome M0012394.jpg|thumb|The first key of [[Basil Valentine]], emblem associated with the 'Great Work' of obtaining the Philosopher's stone (''Twelve Keys of Basil Valentine'').]]
Descriptions of the Philosopher's Stone are numerous and various.&lt;ref&gt;John Read "From Alchemy to Chemistry" p.29&lt;/ref&gt; According to alchemical texts, the stone of the philosophers came in two varieties, prepared by an almost identical method: white (for the purpose of making silver), and red (for the purpose of making gold), the white stone being a less matured version of the red stone.&lt;ref name="A German Sage 1423"&gt;A German Sage. ''A Tract of Great Price Concerning the Philosophical Stone''. 1423.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient and medieval alchemical texts leave clues to the physical appearance of the stone of the philosophers, specifically the red stone. It is often said to be orange (saffron colored) or red when ground to powder. Or in a solid form, an intermediate between red and purple, transparent and glass-like.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederick Helvetius. ''Golden Calf''. 17th Century.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight is spoken of as being heavier than gold,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Anonymous. ''On the Philosophers' Stone''. (unknown date, possibly 16th century)&lt;/ref&gt; and it is soluble in any liquid, yet incombustible in fire.&lt;ref&gt;Eirenaeus Philalethes. ''A Brief Guide to the Celestial Ruby''. 1694 CE&lt;/ref&gt;

Alchemical authors sometimes suggest that the stone's descriptors are metaphorical.&lt;ref&gt;Charles John Samuel Thompson. Alchemy and Alchemists. p.70&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance is expressed geometrically in Michael Maier's ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]''. "Make of a man and woman a circle; then a quadrangle; out of this a triangle; make again a circle, and you will have the Stone of the Wise. Thus is made the stone, which thou canst not discover, unless you, through diligence, learn to understand this geometrical teaching."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Craven. "Count Michael Maier". p.90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean de Roquetaillade|Rupescissa]] uses the imagery of the Christian passion, telling us it ascends "from the sepulcher of the Most Excellent King, shining and glorious, resuscitated from the dead and wearing a red diadem...".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leah DeVun]]. ''Prophecy, alchemy, and the end of time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages''. Columbia University Press, 2009. p.118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretations===
The various names and attributes assigned to the philosopher's stone has led to long-standing speculation on its composition and source. Esoteric candidates have been found in metals, plants, rocks, chemical compounds, and bodily products such as hair, urine, and eggs. [[Justus von Liebig]] states that 'it was indispensable that every substance accessible... should be observed and examined'.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry'' London: G. Bell. 1957. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemists once thought a key component in the creation of the stone was a mythical [[chemical element|element]] named carmot.&lt;ref name=Burt1885&gt;Burt, A.L. 1885. ''The National Standard Encyclopedia: A Dictionary of Literature, the Sciences and the Arts, for Popular Use'' p. 150. [https://books.google.com/books?id=J6QRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA151&amp;dq=carmot+philosopher+stone#PRA2-PA150,M1 Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anton1999&gt;Sebastian, Anton. 1999.

Esoteric [[hermeticism|hermetic]] alchemists may reject work on exoteric substances, instead directing their search for the philosopher's stone inward.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton J. Linden. ''The alchemy reader: from Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton'' Cambridge University Press. 2003. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Though esoteric and exoteric approaches are sometimes mixed, it is clear that some authors "are not concerned with material substances but are employing the language of exoteric alchemy for the sole purpose of expressing theological, philosophical, or mystical beliefs and aspirations".&lt;ref&gt;Eric John Holmyard. ''Alchemy'' Courier Dover Publications, 1990. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; New interpretations continue to be developed around [[spagyric]], chemical, and esoteric schools of thought.

==Creation==
{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}
The philosopher's stone is created by the alchemical method known as The Magnum Opus or The Great Work. Often expressed as a series of color changes or chemical processes, the instructions for creating the philosopher's stone are varied. When expressed in colors, the work may pass through phases of [[nigredo]], [[albedo (alchemy)|albedo]], [[citrinitas]], and [[rubedo]]. When expressed as a series of chemical processes it often includes seven or twelve stages concluding in [[multiplication (alchemy)|multiplication]], and [[projection (alchemy)|projection]].

==Art and entertainment==
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}

The philosopher's stone has been an inspiration, plot feature, or subject of innumerable artistic works: [[animation]]s, [[comic]]s, [[film]]s, [[music]]al compositions, [[novel]]s, and [[video game]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">'''Planar chirality''' is the special case of [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] for two [[dimension]]s.

Most fundamentally, planar [[Chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] is a [[Mathematics|mathematical]] term, finding use in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and related physical sciences, for example, in [[astronomy]], [[optics]] and [[metamaterials]]. Recent occurrences in latter two fields are dominated by [[microwave]] applications and micro- and [[nanostructure]]d planar interfaces for visible and [[infrared]] [[light]].

Planar chirality is also exhibited by molecules like (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]], some di- or poly-substituted [[metallocene]]s, and certain monosubstituted [[paracyclophane]]s. Nature rarely provides planar chiral molecules, [[cavicularin]] being an exception.

=== Assigning the configuration of planar chiral molecules ===
To assign the configuration of a planar chiral molecule, begin by selecting the pilot atom, which is the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|highest priority]] of the atoms that is not in the plane, but are directly attached to an atom in the plane. Next, assign the priority of three adjacent in-plane atoms, starting with the atom attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and preferentially assigning in order of highest priority if there is a choice. When viewed from the side of the pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R, otherwise it is assigned as S.&lt;ref&gt;Kalsi, P.S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLWpHCMP63YC "Stereochemistry Conformation and Mechanism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In optics and metamaterials ==
The study of planar chiral [[metamaterial]]s has revealed that planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.
The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect is referred to as circular conversion dichroism.
Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Rauno August Aaltonen''' (born 7 January 1938), also known as "The Rally Professor", is a [[Finland|Finnish]] former professional [[rallying|rally]] driver who competed in the [[World Rally Championship]] throughout the 1970s.

==Career==
Before WRC was established Aaltonen competed in the [[European Rally Championship]]. He won the championship in 1965, with [[Tony Ambrose]] as his [[co-driver]]. He also won the [[Finnish Rally Championship]] in 1961 and 1965. In 1966, he partnered [[Bob Holden (racing driver)|Bob Holden]] in [[Australia]] to win the premier touring car race, the [[1966 Gallaher 500|Gallaher 500]], in a [[Mini Cooper S]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] in [[New South Wales]].

Aaltonen finished second on six occasions in the [[Safari Rally]], which is considered one of the most difficult courses in rallying. In 1985, he was leading the rally by two hours when his engine broke down before the last few special stages. His other merits include winning the [[Rally Finland|1000 Lakes Rally]] in 1961, the [[RAC Rally]] in 1965, the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1967, the [[Southern Cross Rally]] in 1977, and a ''Coupe des Alpes'' at the [[Alpine Rally]] in 1963 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Pfundner | first=Martin | year=2005 | title=Alpine Trials &amp; Rallies: 1910 to 1973 | publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd | pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite now being remembered as one of the [[Flying Finn]]s of rallying, Aaltonen started his career on [[speed boat]]s and later moved on to motorcycles competing in [[road racing]], [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]] and [[motocross]]. Before he became the first Finnish European Rally Champion, he was the first Finn to win a [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] competition.

Aaltonen was a proponent of [[left-foot braking]].&lt;ref name="theitalianjob.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theitalianjob.com/worksminis_drivinglegends.htm |title=Driving Legends |publisher=theitalianjob.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was among the first four inductees into the [[Rally Hall of Fame]], along with [[Erik Carlsson]], [[Paddy Hopkirk]] and [[Timo Mäkinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New Inductees to Rally Hall of Fame | work=[[Rally Finland|Neste Oil Rally Finland]] | url=http://www.nesteoilrallyfinland.fi/en/28567.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010448/http://www.nesteoilrallyfinland.fi/en/28567.aspx | dead-url=yes | archive-date=30 April 2011 | date=9 February 2011 | accessdate=27 March 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kalanchoe veg.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Production of new individuals along a leaf margin of the  miracle leaf plant (''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''). The small plant in front is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) tall. The concept of "individual" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]
'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s – "offspring" – are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].

In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.

==Asexual==
{{Main article|Asexual reproduction}}
Asexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of "splitting" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.

Some species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]—reproduction without seeds or spores—but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].

Other ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some
[[reptile]]s,&lt;ref name="reptiles"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles &amp; Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986

It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.

Sexual reproduction is a [[biological process]] that creates a new [[organism]] by combining the [[Genetics|genetic]] material of two organisms in a process that starts with [[meiosis]], a specialized type of [[cell division]]. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called "plus" and "minus" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Sonneborn |title= Mating Types in Paramecium Aurelia: Diverse Conditions for Mating in Different Stocks; Occurrence, Number and Interrelations of the Types. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 79, No. 3 (Sep. 30, 1938), pp. 411-434 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |jstor=984858}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more than two  "sexes", called [[syngen]]s.
Most [[animal]]s (including humans) and [[plants]] reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that "the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases" where recombination occurs freely.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Otto and D. B. Goldstein. "Recombination and the Evolution of Diploidy". [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]. Vol 131 (1992): 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE. (1987) The molecular basis of the evolution of sex. ''Adv Genet.'' '''24''':323-370. Review. {{PMID|3324702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryophyte]]s reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are [[haploid]] and produce [[gametes]]. The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.

Allogamy is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)

===Autogamy===
{{main article|Autogamy}}
Self-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term "autogamy" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532–542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.

===Mitosis and meiosis===
[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]]. Mitosis occurs in [[somatic cells]], while meiosis occurs in [[gametes]].

'''Mitosis'''
The resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of [[chromosomes]] in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:mitosis.jpg|center]] --&gt;
'''Meiosis'''
The resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of [[chromosomes]] present in the parent cell. A [[diploid]] cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions ([[tetraploid]] to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four [[haploid]] cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.

==Same-sex==
In recent decades, developmental biologists have been researching and developing techniques to facilitate same-sex reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samesexprocreation.com/timeline.htm |title=Timeline of same-sex procreation scientific developments |publisher=samesexprocreation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are [[female sperm]] and [[male egg]]s, with female sperm closer to being a reality for humans, given that Japanese scientists have already created female sperm for chickens. "However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis."&lt;ref name="chicken sperm"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9227893|title=Differentiation of female chicken primordial germ cells into spermatozoa in male gonads|publisher= | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169X.1997.t01-2-00002.x|volume=39|issue=3|date=June 1997|pages=267–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Washington Post |date=April 22, 2004 |title=Japanese scientists produce mice without using sperm |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wYQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6950,1352704&amp;dq=japanese+scientists+combine+two+mouse+eggs+to+produce+daughter+mice&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two female mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-father-necessary-as-mice-are-created-with-two-mothers-2vskf8w58|title=No father necessary as mice are created with two mothers|last=Blakely|first=Rhys|date=2018-10-12|work=The Times|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en|issn=0140-0460|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhi-Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Le-Yun|last3=Wang|first3=Li-Bin|last4=Feng|first4=Gui-Hai|last5=Yuan|first5=Xue-Wei|last6=Liu|first6=Chao|last7=Xu|first7=Kai|last8=Li|first8=Yu-Huan|last9=Wan|first9=Hai-Feng|date=2018-10-01|title=Generation of Bimaternal and Bipaternal Mice from Hypomethylated Haploid ESCs with Imprinting Region Deletions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304417|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.004|issn=1934-5909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
&lt;!--[[Reproductive strategy]], [[Reproduction strategy]] and [[Reproduction strategies]] redirect here--&gt;
{{further information|Modes of reproduction|Life history theory}}

There are a wide range of reproductive strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.

===Other types===
{{main article|Semelparity and iteroparity}}
* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.
* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].
* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].

==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.

Many organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.

When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]] and Bernstein et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H., Bernstein C. and Michod R.E. (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19: 357-382 in ''DNA Repair'', Inna Kruman (Ed.), InTech (publisher) {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}}. Available online from [http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair intechopen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other "over-wintering" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can "wait out" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.

==Life without==
The existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]]. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the [[last universal ancestor]] to all present life on Earth lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].

Scientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12114528&amp;dopt=Abstract Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template]&lt;br/&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/042809.htm Scientists Create Artificial Virus]&lt;/ref&gt; However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no [[metabolism]] and can only [[self-replication|replicate]] with the assistance of a hijacked [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s metabolic machinery.

The production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A [[Synthetic Genomics|synthetic genome]] has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new ''[[M. mycoides]]'' organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1190719| pmid = 20488990| year = 2010| last1 = Gibson | first1 = D.| last2 = Glass | first2 = J.| last3 = Lartigue | first3 = C.| last4 = Noskov | first4 = V.| last5 = Chuang | first5 = R.| last6 = Algire | first6 = M.| last7 = Benders | first7 = G.| last8 = Montague | first8 = M.| last9 = Ma | first9 = L.| last10 = Moodie | first10 = M.

There is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic&lt;ref name="venter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703559004575256470152341984|title=Scientists Create First Synthetic Cell|author=Robert Lee Hotz|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term "synthetic bacterial cell" but they also clarify "...we do not consider this to be "creating life from scratch" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq |title=FAQ |author=Craig Venter Institute |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that "they are pretty clearly human inventions".&lt;ref name="venter"/&gt; Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield "truly programmable organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = W. Wayte Gibbs | title = Synthetic Life | journal = Scientific American | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=synthetic-life| date = May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers involved stated that the creation of "true synthetic biochemical life" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3214/01.html |title= NOVA: Artificial life |accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lottery principle==
Sexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] used [[lottery]] tickets as an [[analogy]] in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams G C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of "winning" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

{{short description|theme in fiction and legends}}
{{broader|Rotating locomotion in living systems}}
[[Legend]]s and [[speculative fiction]] reveal a longstanding human fascination with [[Rotating locomotion in living systems|rolling and wheeled creatures]]. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia,{{r|Full93}} and in numerous modern works.

==Rolling creatures==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}}

[[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s 1825 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having "the shape of a star or wheel".{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} The 1863 edition of this book featured an illustration by [[Louis Le Breton]], depicting a creature with five legs radially arranged.{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

[[Neil R. Jones]]' 1937 story "On the Planet Fragment" featured aliens dubbed the Disci, which were shaped like wheels with limbs around the circumference. One of their methods of locomotion was a "rolling motion like that of a cartwheel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?87356|title=Internet Speculative Fiction Database entry for "On the Planet Fragment"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.isfdb.org|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1944 science fiction short story "[[Arena (short story)|Arena]]", by [[Fredric Brown]], features a telepathic alien called an Outsider, which is roughly spherical and moves by rolling.{{r|Brown}} The story was the basis for a 1967 ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode of the [[Arena (Star Trek)|same name]], and possibly also a 1964 episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled [[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|"Fun and Games"]], though neither television treatment included a spherical creature.{{r|arena}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] invented a creature that was capable of rolling itself forward, which he named ''Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus''. He illustrated this creature in his 1951 lithograph {{lang|nl|[[Curl-up|Wentelteefje]]}} (also known by the English title ''Curl-up'').{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Escher}}

A 1956 [[Scrooge McDuck]] comic, ''[[Land Beneath the Ground!]]'', by [[Carl Barks]], introduced Terries and Fermies (a play on the phrase ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''), creatures who move from place to place by rolling. The Terries and Fermies have made a sport of their rolling abilities, causing earthquakes in the process.{{r|coa1}}{{r|coa2}}

Northern Irish author [[James White (author)|James White]]'s [[Sector General]] series features "Rollers" from the planet Drambo, doughnut-shaped aquatic organisms that do not have [[heart]]s, but which instead must roll continuously to maintain [[Circulatory system|circulation]] by means of gravity.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|Louie}} The Rollers are described in the short story "Spacebird" in the 1980 edition of ''[[Ambulance Ship]]'', and in other works in the series.{{r|"Ambulance_Ship"}}{{r|"Final_Diagnosis"}}{{r|"Double_Contact"}}

In ''[[The Citadel of Chaos]]'' (1983) by [[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]], the reader may encounter Wheelies, disc-shaped creatures with four arms who move by doing [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]].&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Neil|title=Fighting Fantasy Reviewed - The Citadel of Chaos|url=https://rpggeek.com/thread/488700/fighting-fantasy-reviewed-citadel-chaos|website=RPGGeek|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Steve|title=The Citadel of Chaos|date=1983|isbn=978-1-84831-076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tuf Voyaging]]'', a 1986 science fiction novel by [[George R. R. Martin]], features an alien called a Rolleram, described as a "berserk living cannonball of enormous size", which kills its prey by rolling over it and crushing it, before digesting it externally. Adults of the species weigh approximately six metric tons and can roll faster than {{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr=off}}.{{r|martin}}

In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991, the eponymous [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and his sidekick [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] move by rolling.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

The 1995 short story "Microbe", by [[Kenyon College]] biologist and [[feminist science fiction]] writer [[Joan Slonczewski]], describes an exploratory expedition to an alien world whose plant and animal life consists entirely of [[torus|doughnut-shaped]] organisms.{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}}

==Wheeled creatures==
Toy animals with wheels dating from the [[Pre-Columbian era]] were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

[[File:Wheeler Ozma of Oz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=L. Frank Baum's "Wheeler"|A "Wheeler" in L. Frank Baum's ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (Illustration by [[John R. Neill]])]]
{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
[[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}}  Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}} They also make an appearance in the 1985 film ''[[Return to Oz]]'', based partly on  ''Ozma of Oz''.

The 1968 novel ''[[The Goblin Reservation]]'' by [[Clifford D. Simak]] features an intelligent alien race that uses biological wheels.{{r|Simak}}

''[[Chorlton and the Wheelies]]'', a British [[stop motion|stop-motion]]-animated television series that aired from 1976 to 1979, was set in "Wheelie World", which was inhabited by three-wheeled creatures called "wheelies".{{r|Toonhound}}

[[Piers Anthony]]'s 1977 book ''[[Cluster (novels)|Cluster]]'' and its sequels feature aliens called Polarians, which locomote by gripping and balancing atop a large ball. The ball is a living, though temporarily separable, portion of the Polarian's body.{{r|anthony}}

[[David Brin]]'s [[Uplift Universe|''Uplift'' Universe]] includes a wheeled species called the g'Kek, which are described in some detail in the 1995 novel ''[[Brightness Reef]]''.{{r|Brin95}} In 1996's ''[[Infinity's Shore]]'', a g'Kek is described as looking like "a squid in a wheelchair." The g'Kek suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles in their old age, particularly when living in a [[gravitational biology|high gravity environment]].{{r|Brin95}}{{r|Brin96}}

A 1997 novel in the ''[[Animorphs]]'' series, ''[[The Andalite Chronicles]]'', includes an alien called a Mortron, composed of two separate entities: a yellow and black bottom half with four wheels, and a red, elongated head with razor-sharp teeth and concealed wings.{{r|Applegate}}

The 2000 novel ''[[The Amber Spyglass]]'', by English author [[Philip Pullman]], features an alien race known as the [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]], which have diamond-shaped bodies with one leg at the front and back and one on each side. The Mulefa use large, disk-shaped seed pods as wheels. They mount the pods on bone axles on their front and back legs, while propelling themselves with their side legs. The Mulefa have a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with the seed pod trees, which depend on the rolling action to crack open the pods and allow the seeds to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]].{{r|Pullman}}

In the 2000 novel [[Wheelers (novel)|''Wheelers'']], by English mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], a [[Jupiter|Jovian]] species called "blimps" has developed the ability to biologically produce machines called "wheelers", which use wheels for locomotion.{{r|Stewart}}{{r|kirkus}}

The children's television series ''[[Jungle Junction]]'', which premiered in 2009, features hybrid jungle animals with wheels rather than legs;{{r|BBC-Jungle}} one such animal, Ellyvan, is a hybrid of an [[elephant]] and a [[van]].{{r|junglejunction}} These animals traverse their habitat on elevated [[highway]]s.{{r|disney}}

[[File:Wheeled animal - East Mexico cultures - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC00852.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A toy animal with wheels, from [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] [[Mexico]]{{r|Gambino}}|alt=A toy animal with wheels]]
[[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|Several organisms]] are capable of [[rolling]] locomotion; however, true [[wheel]]s and [[propeller]]s—despite their utility in human [[vehicle]]s—do not appear to play a significant role in the [[animal locomotion|movement of living things]] (with the exception of certain [[flagellum|flagella]], which function like [[corkscrew]]s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in [[speculative fiction]].

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as [[wing]]s and [[lens (optics)|lenses]]), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several [[developmental biology|developmental]] and [[evolution]]ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by [[natural selection]], addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as [[walking]], [[running]], or [[Terrestrial_locomotion#Limbless_locomotion|slithering]]) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels ''could'' evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.&lt;!--Cited in section [[#Rolling resistance]]; per [[WP:LEADCITE]], statements in the lead don't require citation here if cited elsewhere in the article--&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Known instances of rotation in biology==
There exist two distinct modes of [[wikt:locomotion|locomotion]] using [[rotation]]: first, simple [[rolling]]; and second, the use of [[wheel]]s or [[propeller]]s, which spin on an [[axle]] or [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]], relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, [[Unicellular organism|single-celled]] organisms.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}}

===Rolling===
[[File:Steppenschuppentier1a.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A curled-up pangolin|The pangolin ''[[Manis temminckii]]'' in a defensive posture, in which it can roll]]
{{see also|Category:Rolling animals}}
Some organisms use [[Terrestrial locomotion#Rolling|rolling]] as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.{{r|Krus}}{{r|merriam-webster}}

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including [[Patania ruralis|certain caterpillars]] (which do so to [[Anti-predator adaptation|escape danger]]),{{r|Krus}}{{r|Scholtz}} [[Cicindela dorsalis|tiger beetle]] larvae, [[myriapoda|myriapods]], [[mantis shrimp]], [[Armadillidiidae]], and [[Mount Lyell salamander]]s.{{r|Full93}} Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in [[pangolin]]s, [[wheel spider]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[armadillo]]s, [[Armadillo girdled lizard]]s, [[isopoda|isopods]], and [[fossil]]ized [[trilobite]]s.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|armstrong}} These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.{{r|Scholtz}}

[[Tumbleweed]]s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to [[Seed dispersal|distribute their seeds]]. These plants are found especially in open [[plain]] environments.{{r|Ganong}} The most well-known of these include ''[[Kali tragus]]'' (also known as ''Salsola tragus''), or prickly Russian thistle,&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=SATR12|taxon=Salsola tragus|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a [[noxious weed]].&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; Fungi of the genus ''[[Bovista]]'' are known to use the same strategy to disperse their [[spore]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

[[Rotifers]] are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name="Howey"/&gt; Although the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''rotifer'' means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating [[cilia]] used for feeding and propulsion.{{r|pechenik}}

[[Keratinocyte]]s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of [[wound healing]].{{r|Myers}}{{r|Anderson}} These cells serve to form a barrier against [[pathogen]]s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.&lt;ref name="ABN"/&gt;

[[Dung beetle]]s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in [[ancient Egypt]]ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.{{r|Scholtz}}

}}
Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for [[digestion]] rather than propulsion: the [[style (zoology)|crystalline style]] of certain [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and [[gastropoda|gastropods]].{{r|owen}}{{rp|89}} The style consists of a transparent [[glycoprotein]] rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of [[mucus]]. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases [[digestive enzyme]]s.{{r|owen}} Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style ''in vivo'' vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.{{r|kristensen}}

====Molecular====
There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells.{{r|Oster}} [[ATP synthase]] is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer.{{r|Feniouk}} It bears some similarity to the [[flagellum|flagellar motors]] discussed below.{{r|Crofts}} ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by [[mosaic evolution|modular evolution]], in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.{{r|Falk}}

[[File:Physical model of a bacterial flagellum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Model of the base of a bacterial flagellum, a true biological example of a freely rotating structure|alt=Physical model of the base of a bacterial flagellum]]
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive [[torque]] about a fixed body—is the  [[flagellum]], a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled [[prokaryote]]s for propulsion.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|396}} The [[bacterial flagellum]] is the best known example.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|gebremichael}} About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.{{r|goldsworthy}}

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a [[motor protein]] acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by [[proton motive force]], i.e. by the flow of [[proton]]s ([[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a [[concentration gradient]] set up by the cell's [[metabolism]]. (In species of the genus ''[[Vibrio]]'', there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a [[sodium]] [[ion transporter|ion pump]] rather than a [[proton pump]].{{r|Atsumi}}) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;cell lengths per second.{{r|Franklin}} The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase.{{r|Oster}} ''[[Spiral_bacteria#Spirillum|Spirillum]]'' bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.{{r|Chwang}}

[[Archaea]], a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as [[archaellum |archaella]] – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and [[homology (biology)|evolutionarily distinct]] from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], archaella appear to have evolved from [[Pilus#Type IV pili |type IV pili]].{{r|ng}}

Some [[eukaryotic]] cells, such as the protist ''[[Euglena]]'', also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle.{{r|Moran}}{{rp|1105}} The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a [[cilium]] or [[undulipodium]], is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.{{r|mitchell}}

==Biological barriers to wheeled organisms==

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: [[natural selection]] constrains the [[evolution]]ary paths available to species,{{r|Dawkins}} and the processes by which [[multicellular organism]]s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.{{r|gould81}}

===Evolutionary constraints===
[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Sketch of a fitness landscape|Illustration of a [[fitness landscape]], indicating genetic flow of populations toward local [[wikt:optimum|optima]]. Potentially beneficial changes requiring descent into a fitness "valley" are foreclosed by natural selection.]]

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.{{r|Dawkins}}

According to [[neo-Darwinism]], adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals.{{r|Dawkins}} Although [[Neutral mutation|neutral changes]] (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through [[genetic drift]],{{r|kimura}} and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances,{{r|otto}}{{rp|728–729}} large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. [[Richard Dawkins]] describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of [[Mount Improbable]]."{{r|Dawkins}} In such a [[fitness landscape]], wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the [[gene pool]] to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}}

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the [[evolution of flagella]], individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells.{{r|matzke03}}{{r|matzke06}}{{r|pallen}} This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called ''[[exaptation]]''.{{r|gould82}}

Molecular biologist [[Robin Holliday]] has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against [[creationism|creationist]] or [[intelligent design]] accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.{{r|Holliday}}

===Developmental and anatomical constraints===
{{Wikibooks|Biomechanics}}
Using human [[manufacturing]] processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of [[developmental biology|embryonic development]] are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.{{refn|group=Note|Although evolutionary and developmental constraints may preclude the possibility of a wheel as ''part'' of an organism, they do not preclude the use of foreign objects as "wheels", either instinctively (as in the case of the dung beetles discussed above), or through intelligently directed [[tool use by animals|tool use]] (as in human technology).}}{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|gould81}}{{r|Fish}}

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the [[biointerface|interface]] between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly [[axle]]) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism.{{refn|group=Note|Wheels can be considered to fall into two types: passive and driven. A passive wheel simply rolls freely over a surface, reducing [[friction]] when compared with dragging. A driven wheel is powered, and transmits energy to the surface in order to generate forward motion.{{r|Bräunl}}}} Unlike animal [[joint]]s, which have a limited [[range of motion]], a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism).{{r|gould81}}{{rp|44}} There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

====Power transmission to driven wheels====
[[File:Biceps (PSF).jpg|alt=Drawing of human arm muscles|Skeletal muscle, attached at each end to bone|thumb]]
In the case of a driven wheel, a [[torque]] must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including [[Electric motor|electric]], [[Internal combustion engine|piston-driven]], [[Turbine|turbine-driven]], [[Pneumatic motor|pneumatic]], and [[Hydraulic motor|hydraulic]]. (Torque may also be provided by [[human power]], as in the case of a [[bicycle]].) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of [[skeletal muscle]]s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|406}} Because these muscles are [[connective tissue|attached]] to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.{{r|Fish}}

====Friction====
Reducing friction is vital for minimizing [[wear]] on mechanical components and preventing overheating.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|1}} As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases.{{r|Seireg}}{{rp|2–3}} Various types of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and/or [[lubricant]] may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components.{{r|Jones}} In biological joints such as the human [[knee]], friction is reduced by means of [[cartilage]] with a very low [[Coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]], as well as lubricating [[synovial fluid]], which has very low [[viscosity]].{{r|Callaghan}} Gerhard Scholtz of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] asserts that a similar [[secretion|secreted]] lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.{{r|Scholtz}}

====Nutrient and waste transfer====
Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with [[oxygen]] and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal [[circulatory system]], composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface.{{r|Dawkins}}{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|405}} In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to [[diffusion|diffuse]] across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available [[partial pressure]] and [[surface area]], in accordance with [[Fick's law of diffusion]].{{r|gould81}}{{rp|48}} For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient.{{r|Diamond}} Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as [[keratin]], of which [[hair]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] are composed.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}}

==Disadvantages of wheels==
Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with [[Limb (anatomy)|limbed]] locomotion.{{r|Dawkins}} These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems.{{r|Scholtz}} In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?"{{r|Diamond}} The use of wheels rather than limbs in most [[engineering|engineered]] vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of [[design]] required to construct and [[control system|control]] limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.{{r|Full02}}{{r|Donat}}

===Efficiency===

====Rolling resistance====
[[File:Rolling Resistance.PNG|right|thumb|alt=Diagram of the forces acting on a wheel|A hard wheel rolling on—and deforming—a soft surface, resulting in the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] ''N'', which has a component that opposes the motion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(''W'' is the weight of the wheel plus the portion of the vehicle being supported; ''F'' is a propulsive force; ''N'' is the [[Reaction (physics)|reaction force]] from the surface; ''r'' is the radius of wheel.)]]

Although stiff wheels are more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]] than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level [[terrain]] (such as [[Road surface|paved roads]]), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as [[soil]], because they are vulnerable to [[rolling resistance]]. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|401}} Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater.{{r|Diamond}} While wheels must deform the surface along their [[rut (roads)|entire path]], limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.{{r|Todd}}

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels.{{r|Diamond}} During the time of the [[Roman Empire]], wheeled [[chariot]]s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to [[dromedary|camel]]s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'', Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by [[ox]]en.{{r|lienhard}}

====Efficiency of aquatic locomotion====
When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low [[Reynolds number]]s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas [[oscillation|oscillating]] systems have the advantage at higher ([[inertia]]-dominated) Reynolds numbers.{{r|Radharkrishnan}}{{rp|5451}} Whereas ship propellers typically have [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]] around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered ''[[Gossamer Condor]]''), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] like a fish tail or bird wing.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|398}}{{r|Diamond}}

===Traction===
Wheels are prone to [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slipping]]—an inability to generate [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of [[biologically inspired engineering]], [[Walker (machine)#Real walking vehicles|legged vehicles]] find use in the [[logging]] industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate.{{r|space.com}} [[Continuous track|Tracked]] vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground{{r|Wong}}{{rp|354}}—but they tend to have larger [[turning radius|turning radii]] than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.{{r|Wong}}{{rp|419}}
{{clear}}

===Obstacle navigation===
[[File:Mountain Goat on Mount Huron in Colorado Image 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Mountain goats on rocky terrain|A [[mountain goat]] navigating a rocky landscape. Mountain goats illustrate the versatility of legs in challenging terrain.]]
Work by engineer [[Mieczysław G. Bekker]] implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains [[scale invariance|at all size scales]].{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400–401}} The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.{{r|Diamond}}

====Going around====
Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the [[University of Chicago]] illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and [[wheelchair]]-using humans.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402}} As [[Jared Diamond]] points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by [[dung beetle]]s and [[tumbleweed]]s.{{r|Diamond}}{{r|Nof}}{{r|Bala}}

====Going over====
Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height.{{r|Nof}}{{rp|148}} Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|400}}

In addition, without [[wikt:articulation|articulation]], a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground.{{r|Bala}} Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|402–403}}

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the [[wheelbase]] or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over.{{r|nap}} At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning.{{r|johnson}} Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

===Versatility===
Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as [[prehensility|grasping]], [[fine motor skill|manipulating]], [[arboreal locomotion|climbing]], [[brachiation|branch-swinging]], [[aquatic locomotion#Secondary evolution of swimming|swimming]], [[fossorial|digging]], [[jumping]], [[throwing]], [[kick]]ing, and [[personal grooming|grooming]]. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.{{r|LaBarbera}}{{rp|399}}

==In fiction and legend==
[[File:Ill_dict_infernal_p0139-123_buer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Illustration of the demon Buer|The demon [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], from the 1863 edition of ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'']]
{{main|Rolling and wheeled creatures in fiction and legend}}
Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe,{{r|de_Plancy_1825}} Japan,{{r|Pruett}} [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Mexico,{{r|Gambino}} the United States, and Australia.{{r|Full93}}

===Rolling creatures===
The [[hoop snake]], a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey.{{r|Full93}} Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the ''[[Tsuchinoko]]''.{{r|Pruett}} [[Buer (demon)|Buer]], a [[demon]] mentioned in the 16th-century [[grimoire]] ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', was described and illustrated in [[Jacques Collin de Plancy|Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.{{r|de_Plancy_1825}}{{r|de_Plancy_1863}}

The Dutch graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in [[Curl-up|a 1951 lithograph]].{{r|Escher}} Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author [[Carl Barks]],{{r|Andrae}} science fiction writers [[Fredric Brown]],{{r|Brown}} [[George R. R. Martin]],{{r|martin}} and [[Joan Slonczewski]],{{r|Switzer}}{{r|Slonczewski}} and in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'']] video game series, which first appeared in 1991.{{r|Sega}}{{r|Thomas}}

===Wheeled creatures===
Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in [[Veracruz]], Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.{{r|Gambino}}

{{wikisource|Ozma of Oz}}
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s 1907 children's novel ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers.{{r|Baum}} Their wheels are composed of [[keratin]], which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels.{{r|Scholtz}}{{r|Diamond}} Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.{{r|Baum}}

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including [[Clifford D. Simak]],{{r|Simak}} [[Piers Anthony]],{{r|anthony}} [[David Brin]],{{r|Brin95}} [[K. A. Applegate]],{{r|Applegate}} [[Philip Pullman]],{{r|Pullman}} and writing partners [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]].{{r|Stewart}} Some of these works address the developmental and [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from [[arthritis|arthritic]] axles,{{r|Brin95}}{{rp|109}} and Pullman's [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Mulefa|Mulefa]] are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they [[coevolution|coevolved]].{{r|Pullman}}

'''Selfishness''' is being concerned excessively or exclusively, for oneself or one's own advantage, pleasure, or welfare, regardless of others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfish?show=0&amp;t=1408827003 "Selfish"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019174738/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfish?show=0&amp;t=1408827003 |date=2014-10-19 }}, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, accessed on 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/selfish Selfishness - meaning], reference.com, accessed on 23 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Selfishness is the opposite of [[altruism]] or selflessness; and has also been contrasted (as by [[C. S. Lewis]]) with [[Egocentrism|self-centeredness]].&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Surprised by Joy'' (1988) p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divergent views==
The implications of selfishness have inspired divergent views within [[religion|religious]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[psychology|psychological]], [[economy|economic]], and [[sociobiology|evolutionary]] contexts.

===Classical===
[[Aristotle]] joined a perceived majority of his countrymen in condemning those who sought only to profit themselves; but he approved the man of reason who sought to gain for himself the greatest share of that which deserved social praise.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 301-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] proposed a cultivation of the self within a wider community – a care for the self which he opposed to mere selfishness in a theme that would later be taken up by [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 138-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval/Renaissance===
Selfishness was viewed in the Western Christian tradition as a central [[vice]] – as standing at the roots of the [[Seven deadly sins]] in the form of pride.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatorio'' (1971) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] carried forward this tradition when he characterised “Wisdom for a man's self...[a]s the wisdom of rats”.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''The Essays'' (1985) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernity===
With the emergence of a commercial society, [[Bernard Mandeville]] proposed the paradox that social and economic advance depended on private vices – on what he called the sordidness of selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, ''The Fable of the Bees'' (1970) p. 410 and p. 81-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] with the concept of the [[invisible hand]] saw the economic system as usefully channelling selfish self-interest to wider ends;&lt;ref&gt;M. Skousen, ''The Big Three in Economics'' (2007) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John Locke]] based society upon the solitary individual, arguably opening the door for later thinkers like [[Ayn Rand]] to argue for selfishness as a social virtue and the root of social progress.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Nevins, The Politics of Selfishness'' (2010) p. xii-iii&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] opposed the latter view by way of the Aristotelian argument that framing the fundamental question of politics as a choice between altruism and selfishness is a basic and harmful mistake of modern states. Rather, cooperation ought to be the norm: human beings are by nature social animals, and so individual persons can only find their full good in and through pursuing [[Common good#Catholic social teaching|the good of the community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maritain|first=Jacques|title=The Person and the Common Good|year=1973|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0268002046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Lack of [[empathy]] has been seen as one of the roots of selfishness, extending as far as the cold [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of the [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 104-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast between self-affirmation and selfishness has become a conflictual arena in which the respective claims of individual/community are often played out between parents and children&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (1969) p. 142-3&lt;/ref&gt; or men and women, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/singletons/201008/what-is-selfish What is Selfish?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychoanalysts]] favor the development of a genuine sense of self, and may even speak of a healthy selfishness,&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the self-occlusion&lt;ref&gt;Terence Real, ''I Don't Want to Talk About It'' (1997) p. 203-5&lt;/ref&gt; of what [[Anna Freud]] called 'emotional surrender'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation''  (1994) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminology==
Self-centeredness was marked as a key feature in a phenomenological theory of criminality named "The [[Criminal Spin]]" model. Accordingly, in most criminal behaviors there is an heightened state of self-centeredness, that differently manifests itself in different situations and in different forms of criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Ronel, N. (2011). Criminal behavior, criminal mind: Being caught in a criminal spin. International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, 55(8), 1208 - 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treens''' are fictional aliens in the [[Dan Dare]] stories. They first appeared in ''[[Dan Dare: The First Story]]'', which was serialized in [[Eagle (comic)|the ''Eagle'']] comic magazine from Volume 1, Number 1 (April 14, 1950) to Volume 2, Number 25 (September 28, 1951). The story was drawn by [[Frank Hampson]].

==Fictional background==
The Treens are a race of green-skinned [[humanoid]]s from the northern hemisphere of the planet [[Venus]]. The southern hemisphere is inhabited by the Therons, a human-like race with an obvious affinity to humanity on Earth. The Treens share the northern hemisphere with the  ''Atlantines'', a blue-skinned people whose ancestors came from Earth 100,000 years previously. The two hemispheres are separated by the "flamelands" around the equator which are impassable, except by specially equipped aircraft.

The leader of the Treens is [[the Mekon]], an individual specifically engineered to have a high intelligence. The Treens are portrayed as mostly unemotional without the usual human feelings about the sanctity of life. In ancient times, they lived as savage jungle tribes permanently involved in tribal wars amongst themselves, until in a major war the Therons occupied the northern hemisphere by force in an attempt to civilize the Treens. The attempt failed and the Therons later abandoned the Treens to their own devices.

Soon after, Treen scientists created the first ''Mekon'' as a "super-brain" to rule over the Treen race. The Mekon developed Treen society into a highly organized militaristic logic-based society where orders are obeyed without query, and which is usually in a state of hostility with the Therons and Earth, both of whose lands they have on occasion occupied. Their [[capital city]] is called [[Mekonta]] and is on islands in a lake. The Atlantines are usually ignored by the Treens, and live in primitive conditions.
	 
'''Mekonta''' is the capital city of the Treens in the [[Dan Dare]] stories. It is named after [[The Mekon]]. It is built on many islands in a lake. Its design may have been inspired by [[Venice]] and/or [[Tenochtitlan]]. It was ruined in the war in ''[[Dan Dare: The First Story]]'', and New Mekonta was built nearby. Afterwards for a long time Old Mekonta remained uncleared ruins.
	 
The Magnets of Mekonta are huge [[electromagnet]]s on mountaintops around Mekonta. They are used to raise and lower spaceships in and out of Mekonta.

==Political interpretation==
Creator Frank Hampson stated "Basically we were fighting the Second World War again – the Treens were the Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Onward Christian Spacemen: Dan Dare - Pilot of the Future as British Cultural History | last=Chapman | first=James | journal=Visual Culture in Britain | volume=9 | number=1 | date=June 2008 | pages=55–79 | publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/manup/vcb/2008/00000009/00000001/art00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
*A Treen was briefly seen in ''[[Scarlet Traces: The Great Game]]''. A Treen was seen drinking at the Star Stop diner in Marvel Comic's She-Hulk (4-7).
*Inky schoolboy [[Nigel Molesworth]] on being caught smoking, remarked "You have caught me Sir, like a Treen in a disabled spaceship."
*In the universe of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', the Treens enter an alliance with Earth as of 1969, and schools where they are taught English are established. In 2009, however, relations have intensified.

Like most other [[hydrozoan]]s, ''T. dohrnii'' begin their life as free-swimming tiny [[larva]]e known as [[planula]]. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of [[polyp]]s that are attached to the sea-floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones. The polyps form into an extensively branched form, which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Jellyfish, also known as medusae, then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature. When sexually mature they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace. If a ''T. dohrnii'' jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or physical assault, or is sick or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; It does this through the cell development process of [[transdifferentiation]], which alters the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated state of the cells]] and transforms them into new types of cells.

Theoretically, this process can go on indefinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|year=2006|accessdate=2009-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|archivedate=2010-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in practice individuals can still die.

The capability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes ''T. dohrnii'' an important target of basic biological, [[Ageing|aging]] and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencepub.net/stem/stem0504/007_A00288stem050414_49_53.pdf|doi=10.7537/marsscj050414.07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "immortal jellyfish" was formerly classified as ''[[Turritopsis nutricula|T. nutricula]]''.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt;

== Description ==

The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is bell-shaped, with a maximum diameter of about {{convert|4.5|mm|in}} and is about as tall as it is wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramp|first=P. L.|title=Synopsis of the medusae of the world|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|year=1961|volume=40|pages=1–469|doi=10.1017/s0025315400007347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline26012009" /&gt; The jelly in the walls of the bell is uniformly thin, except for some thickening at the apex. The relatively large stomach is bright red and has a cruciform shape in cross section. Young specimens 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter have only eight tentacles evenly spaced out along the edge,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martell|first=L.|last2=Piraino|first2=S.|last3=Gravili|first3=C.|last4=Boero|first4=F.|date=2016-07-02|title=Life cycle, morphology and medusa ontogenesis of Turritopsis dohrnii (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa)|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|volume=83|issue=3|pages=390–399|doi=10.1080/11250003.2016.1203034|issn=1125-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas adult specimens have 80–90 tentacles. The medusa (jellyfish) is free-living in the plankton. Dense [[nerve net]] cells are also present in the [[epidermis]] in the cap. They form a large ring-like structure above the radial cannal which is commonly presented in cnidarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koizumi|first=Osamu|last2=Hamada|first2=Shun|last3=Minobe|first3=Sumiko|last4=Hamaguchi-Hamada|first4=Kayoko|last5=Kurumata-Shigeto|first5=Mami|last6=Nakamura|first6=Masaru|last7=Namikawa|first7=Hiroshi|title=The nerve ring in cnidarians: its presence and structure in hydrozoan medusae|journal=Zoology|volume=118|issue=2|pages=79–88|doi=10.1016/j.zool.2014.10.001|pmid=25498132|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Turritopsis dohrnii'' also has a bottom-living polyp form, or hydroid, which consists of [[stolon]]s that run along the substrate, and upright branches with feeding polyps that can produce medusa buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=C. McLean|title=Hydroids of the Pacific Coast of Canada and the United States|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1937|pages=201 plus 44 plates}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polyps develop over a few days into tiny 1&amp;nbsp;mm medusae, which are liberated and swim free from the parent hydroid colony.

Images of both the medusa and polyp of the closely related species ''[[Turritopsis rubra]]'' from [[New Zealand]] can be found online.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |title=Turritopsis rubra |last=Schuchert |first=Peter |accessdate=23 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912180002/http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a recent genetic study, it was thought that ''Turritopsis rubra'' and ''Turritopsis nutricula'' were the same.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt; It is not known whether or not ''T. rubra'' medusae can also transform back into polyps.

== Distribution and invasion ==

''Turritopsis'' is believed to have originated in the [[Pacific]] but has spread all over the world through trans-Arctic migrations, and has speciated into several populations that are easy to distinguish morphologically, but whose species distinctions have recently been verified by a study and comparison of mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences.&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miglietta|first=M.

== Life cycle ==

The eggs develop in gonads of female medusae, which are located in the walls of the manubrium (stomach). Mature eggs are presumably spawned and fertilized in the sea by sperm produced and released by male medusae, as is the case for most hydromedusae, although the related species ''Turritopsis rubra'' seems to retain fertilized eggs until the planula stage.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"/&gt; Fertilized eggs develop into [[planula]] larvae, which settle onto the sea-floor (or even the rich marine communities that live on floating docks), and develop into polyp colonies ([[hydroids]]). The hydroids bud new jellyfishes, which are released at about one millimetre in size and then grow and feed in the plankton, becoming sexually mature after a few weeks (the exact duration depends on the ocean temperature; at {{convert|20|C|F}} it is 25 to 30 days and at {{convert|22|C|F}} it is 18 to 22 days).&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt; Medusae of ''T. dohrnii'' are able to survive between 14&amp;nbsp;°C  and 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biological immortality ===

Most jellyfish species have a relatively fixed life-span, which varies by species from hours to many months (long-lived mature jellyfish spawn every day or night; the time is also fairly fixed and species-specific).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=C. E.|year=1983|title=Vertical migration and diel activity patterns of hydromedusae: studies in a large tank|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=5|pages=619–635|doi=10.1093/plankt/5.5.619|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is the only form known to have developed the ability to return to a polyp state, by a specific transformation process that requires the presence of certain cell types (tissue from both the jellyfish bell surface and the circulatory canal system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/meet-the-worlds-only-immortal-animal/|title = Meet the world's only immortal animal|date = December 5, 2008|accessdate = January 10, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful laboratory experiments have revealed that all stages of the medusae, from newly released to fully mature individuals, can transform back into polyps under the conditions of starvation, sudden temperature change, reduction of salinity and artificial damage of the bell with forceps or scissor.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; The transforming [[medusae|medusa]] is characterized first by deterioration of the bell, mesoglea and tentacles. All immature medusa (with 12 tentacles at most) then turned into a [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]-like stage and then transformed into [[stolon]]s and polyps. However, about 20%-40% of mature medusa went into stolons and polyps stage without passing cyst-like stage. Polyps were formed after 2 days since stolons had developed and fed on food. Polyps further multiply by growing additional stolons, branches and then polyps, to form colonial [[hydroids]]. In the experiment, they would eventually transform into stolons and polyps and begin their lives once again even without suffering from environment changes or injury.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Diagram of the transformation procedure can be found at the further reading.

This ability to reverse the biotic cycle (in response to adverse conditions) is unique in the [[animals|animal kingdom]], and allows the jellyfish to bypass death, rendering ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' potentially [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]. The process has not been observed in their natural habitat, in part because the process is quite rapid, and because field observations at the right moment are unlikely.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Regardless, most individual medusae are likely to fall victim to the general hazards of life as [[plankton]], including being eaten by predators or succumbing to disease.

The species' cell development method of transdifferentiation has inspired scientists to find a way to make stem cells using this process for renewing damaged or dead tissue in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimberu|first=Peniel M.|title=Immortal Jellyfish Provides Clues for Regenerative Medicine|url=http://singularityhub.com/2011/04/25/immortal-jellyfish-provides-clues-for-regenerative-medicine/|publisher=Singularity Hub|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic analysis ==
Genomic analyses such as [[sequence analysis]] on [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] or [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] DNA have been employed to investigate its lifecycle. mRNA analysis of each life stage showed that a stage-specific gene in the medusae stage is expressed tenfold more than in other stages. This gene is relative to a [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signal]] that can induce a regeneration process upon injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logan|first=Catriona Y.|last2=Nusse|first2=Roel|date=2004-10-08|title=The wnt signaling pathway in development and disease|journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=781–810|doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.20.010403.113126|pmid=15473860|issn=1081-0706|citeseerx=10.1.1.322.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasegawa|first=Yoshinori|last2=Watanabe|first2=Takashi|last3=Takazawa|first3=Masaki|last4=Ohara|first4=Osamu|last5=Kubota|first5=Shin|date=2016-08-01|title=De Novo Assembly of the Transcriptome of Turritopsis, a Jellyfish that Repeatedly Rejuvenates|journal=Zoological Science|volume=33|issue=4|pages=366–371|doi=10.2108/zs150186|pmid=27498796|issn=0289-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]] homologs and protein homologs identified ''[[Nemopsis bachei]]'' as the species' closest relative. None of the closely related species show biological immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devarapalli|first=Pratap|last2=Science|first2=Department of Genomic|last3=Kerala|first3=Central University of|last4=Campus|first4=Riverside Transit|last5=Science|first5=Opp: Nehru College of Arts and|last6=17|first6=NH|last7=Padanakkad|last8=Nileshwer|last9=Kasaragod|title=The conserved mitochondrial gene distribution in relatives of Turritopsis nutricula, an immortal jellyfish|url=http://www.bioinformation.net/010/97320630010586.htm|journal=Bioinformation|volume=10|issue=9|pages=586–591|doi=10.6026/97320630010586|pmid=25352727|pmc=4209368|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culturing==

Keeping ''T. dohrnii'' in captivity is quite difficult. Currently only one scientist, Shin Kubota from [[Kyoto University]], has managed to sustain a group of these jellyfish for a prolonged period of time. The plankton must be inspected daily to ensure that they have properly digested the [[Brine shrimp|Artemia cysts]] they are being fed.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; 
Kubota reported that during a two-year period, his colony rebirthed itself 11 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S Kubota|title=Repeating rejuvenation in Turritopsis, an immortal hydrozoan (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa)|journal=Biogeography|issn=1345-0662|year=2011|volume=13|number=|pages=101–103|pmid=|url=http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029093746/http://www.benikurage.com/jp/2011biogeography.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubota regularly appears on Japanese television to talk about his immortal jellyfish and has recorded several songs about them.&lt;ref name=nytm&gt;{{cite news |last=Rich|first=Nathaniel|title=Can a jellyfish unlock the secret of immortality? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/magazine/can-a-jellyfish-unlock-the-secret-of-immortality.html?src=me&amp;ref=general|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=November 28, 2012|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

Bacteria, [[virus]]es and one [[genus]] of [[yeast]]s are a normal part of the uterus before and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014"/&gt; The uterus has been found to possess its own characteristic microbiome that differs significantly from the [[List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women|vaginal microbiome]]. Despite its close spatial connection with the vagina, the microbiome of the uterus more closely resembles the commensal bacteria found in the [[Oral microbiology|oral cavity]]. 
In addition, the [[List of antimicrobial peptides in the female reproductive tract|immune system]] is able to differentiate between those bacteria normally found in the uterus and those that are pathogenic. [[Hormone|Hormonal]] changes have an effect on the microbiota of the uterus.&lt;ref name="YarbroughWinkle2014"/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal|last1=Yarbrough|first1=V.

== Clinical significance ==
Prophylactic antibiotics have been injected into the uterus to treat infertility. This has been done before the transfer of embryos with the intent to improve implantation rates. No association exists between successful implantation and antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref name="FranasiakScott2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franasiak|first1=Jason M.|last2=Scott|first2=Richard T.|title=Reproductive tract microbiome in assisted reproductive technologies|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=104|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1364–1371|issn=0015-0282|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2015.10.012|pmid=26597628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infertility treatments often progress to the point where a microbiological analysis of the uterine microbiota is performed. Preterm birth is associated with certain species of bacteria that are not normally part of the healthy uterine microbiome.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014" /&gt;

== Immune response ==

The immune response becomes more pronounced when bacteria are found that are not commensal.&lt;ref name="PayneBayatibojakhi2014" /&gt;

==History==
Investigations into reproductive-associated microbiomes began around 1885 by [[Theodor Escherich]]. He wrote that meconium from the newborn was free of bacteria. There was a general consensus at the time and even recently that the uterus was sterile and this was referred to as the ''sterile womb paradigm.'' Other investigations used sterile diapers for meconium collection. No bacteria were able to be cultured from the samples. Other studies showed that bacteria were detected and were directly proportional to the time between birth and the passage of meconium.&lt;ref name="Per2017"/&gt;

==Research==
Investigations into the role of the uterine microbiome in the development of the infant microbiome are ongoing.&lt;ref name = Per2017/&gt;

'''Wereworms''' were  [[mythical]] creatures in [[Middle-earth]]. In the stories of [[hobbits]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Tolkien English Glossary A Guide to Old Uncommon and Archaic Words Used in the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780557255788|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}} the were-worms were supposedly terrible monsters that made their home in the Last Desert very [[Rhûn|far east]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]].
In the tales of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the Wereworms were likened to [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|Dragons]]  and serpents. To Hobbits they were memories of creatures that stalked the Earth during the [[Wars of Beleriand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopaedia | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1991 | isbn=9780684839790|page=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early drafts of the book, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] had associated these wereworms with the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Modern Folklore | author=Robert B Durham | isbn=9781312909694}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John D. Rateliff]]'s ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' links this reference to [[Mongolian death worm]]s.

==Adaptations==
These creatures appeared in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''. Apparently they were used only for tunnelling, and not for fighting, because they did not take part in the ensuing battle.
They were thought to have tunnelled through the [[Misty Mountains]] and the Blue Mountains ([[Ered Luin]]), although tunnelling is known to be mostly the work of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1351">"'''What the Dead Men Say'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[novella]] by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[Worlds of Tomorrow (magazine)|Worlds of Tomorrow]]'' magazine in June 1964. The manuscript, originally titled "Man With a Broken Match", was received by Dick's agent on 15 April 1963.

==Plot summary==
[[Death]] is followed by a period of '[[half-life]]', a short amount of time which can be rationed out over long periods in which the dead can be revived—so that, potentially, they can 'live' on for a long time. When attempts to bring back important businessman Louis Sarapis fail, it's clearly more than mere negligence. Sure enough, Sarapis starts speaking from beyond the grave. From [[outer space]], in fact. Yet no-one seems terribly bothered, other than those directly concerned in the plot mechanics. Eventually entire [[communications networks]] (phones, TV, radio) are blocked by Sarapis' broadcasts.

The concept of 'half-life' was used again and developed in Dick's 1969 novel ''[[Ubik]]'', which even re-uses a page of the novella verbatim.
