'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Benet, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "''Abie's Irish Rose''"; [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Long Runs in the Theater website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abroad", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]] June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert&lt;ref name="bb020742"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Paul|title=Program Reviews: 'Abie's Irish Rose'|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-07.o.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, [[Richard Coogan]] and [[Bud Collyer|Clayton "Bud" Collyer]] as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, [[Mercedes McCambridge]], [[Julie Stevens (American radio actress)|Julie Stevens]], [[Bernard Gorcey]], and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, [[Charlie Cantor]] and [[Alan Reed]].

Others in the radio cast: [[Walter Kinsella (actor)|Walter Kinsella]] (as Patrick Murphy), [[Menasha Skulnik]] (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was "[[My Wild Irish Rose]]" by [[Chauncey Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', 45 F.2d 119 ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
The plot was ably summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the lawsuit:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm Cool Copyright: Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, November 10, 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Herrmann, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which [[Harpo Marx]] won with "No worse than a bad cold."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malarcher, Jay. "No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close." Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller_and_Meara|Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title=‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ ''Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary_David_Goldberg|Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family_Ties|Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar &lt;!--|God--&gt;}}

The '''argument from miracles''' is an argument for the [[Existence of God|existence of]] [[God]] &lt;!--and/or gods?--&gt; that relies on the belief that events [[Eyewitness testimony|witnessed and described]] as [[miracle]]s –&amp;nbsp;i.e. as events not explicable by natural or scientific laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/miracle?q=miracle Miracle] at oxforddictionaries.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– indicate the intervention of the [[supernatural]].

One example of this argument is the [[Christological argument]]: the claim that historical evidence proves that [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus Christ rose from the dead]] and that this can only be explained if God exists. Another is the claim that many of the [[Qur'an]]'s [[Prophecy|prophecies]] have been fulfilled and that this too can only be explained if God ([[Allah]]) exists.

Defenders of the argument include [[C. S. Lewis]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[William of Ockham]].

== Criticisms ==

One counter-argument to the argument from miracles is the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], which states that multiple incompatible miracles are alleged to have occurred which provide evidence for different religions. Not all these can be correct.

Another counter-argument is [[Occam's razor]], which can be used to argue that God is unnecessary to explain miracles for which natural explanations can be found. In his documentary ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'', British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] utilises this argument when examining the supposed miracles in [[Lourdes]], France. According to [[Catholic theology]], supernatural cures occur in the area, but Dawkins expresses doubts as to their divine nature, noting that all the recorded cures comprise diseases which may have healed by themselves without the need for divine intervention.

Modern theologians rely on the arguments by [[David Hume]], an eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, who is  known today for his skepticism and naturalism. Before making any claims, Hume explains the principle of evidence: the only way that we can assess the credibility of two claims is by weighing evidence. According to him, because evidence for miracles is always limited, we do not have a reason to believe in them.

In 2005, the [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] decided to put all military ministry training at the same location. While it was authorized, funding was not part of the BRAC, and the Air Force departed Ft Jackson in 2012, currently leaving only the Army and Navy at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Center. &lt;ref name=NCSCgrad /&gt;

The purpose of the AFCC was to have closer cooperation among the three chaplain corps and to share instruction and training. While that was the goal, the core curriculums were maintained by the three service schools and a joint program of instruction (POI) was never created. &lt;ref name=NCSCgrad /&gt;

The U.S. Army Chaplain School was approved on 9 February 1918. Its first session began on 3 March 1918, at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.chapnet.army.mil/usachcs/corps_museum.html Chaplaincy History &amp; Museum: History of Chaplain Corps] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331183639/http://www.chapnet.army.mil/usachcs/corps_museum.html |date=31 March 2010 }}.

==Chaplain Candidate==
[[File:Chaplain Candidate Branch Insignia.png|thumb|110px|Chaplain Candidate Insignia]]
Due to a revision of DA PAM 611-21 (Military Occupational Classification and Structure) Effective October 1, 2013, Chaplain Candidates, previously belonging to the Staff Specialist Branch until ordination have worn the Staff Specialist insignia in lieu of religious denomination insignia. The transition from the Staff Specialist Branch to the Chaplain Branch left the candidates without an authorized branch insignia. Responding to the need, Chief of Chaplains Chaplain (Major General) [[Donald L. Rutherford]] submitted a request for collar insignia which was approved by HQDA, G-1 on 23 February 2012. The design for the collar insignia was authorized on 18 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15287&amp;CategoryId=9362&amp;grp=2&amp;menu=Uniformed%20Services&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clergy''' are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain [[religion]]s.  The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's [[doctrine]]s and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are ''clergyman'', ''clergywoman'' and ''churchman''. Less common terms are ''churchwoman'', ''clergyperson'' and ''cleric''.

In [[Christianity]] the specific names and roles of clergy vary by [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and there is a wide range of formal and informal clergy positions, including [[deacon]]s, elders, [[priest]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[preacher]]s, [[pastor]]s, [[Religious minister|minister]]s and the [[Pope]]. In [[Islam]], a religious leader is often known formally or informally as an [[imam]], [[qadi]], [[mufti]], [[mullah]] or [[ayatollah]]. In Jewish tradition, a religious leader is often a [[rabbi]] (teacher) or [[hazzan]] (cantor).

== Etymology ==
The word "Cleric" comes from the [[ecclesiastical Latin]] ''Clericus'', for those belonging to the priestly class. In turn, the source of the Latin word is from the [[Ecclesiastical Greek]] ''Clericus'', meaning appertaining to an inheritance, in reference to the fact that the [[Levitical]] priests of the [[Old Testament]] had no inheritance except the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cleric
|title=cleric |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Clergy" is from two [[Old French]] words, ''clergié'' and ''clergie'', which refer to those with learning and derive from [[Medieval Latin]] ''clericatus'', from [[Late Latin]] ''clericus'' (the same word from which "cleric" is derived).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clergy
|title=clergy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Clerk", which used to mean one ordained to the ministry, also derives from ''clericus''. In the Middle Ages, reading and writing were almost exclusively the domain of the priestly class, and this is the reason for the close relationship of these words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clerk
|title=clerk |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Christianity]], especially in [[Eastern Christianity]] and formerly in Western [[Roman Catholicism]], the term ''cleric'' refers to any individual who has been ordained, including [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[bishop]]s.&lt;ref name=cathenc&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04049b.htm Cleric] - ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin Roman Catholicism]], the [[tonsure]] was a prerequisite for receiving any of the [[minor orders]] or [[major orders]] before the tonsure, [[minor orders]], and the [[subdiaconate]] were abolished following the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI, Apostolic letter ''motu proprio'' ''Ministeria quaedam'' nos. 2–4, 64 AAS 529 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the clerical state is tied to reception of the diaconate.&lt;ref&gt;''Ministeria quaedam'' no. 1; CIC Canon 266 §&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minor Orders]] are still given in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], and those who receive those orders are 'minor clerics.'&lt;ref&gt;CCEO Canon 327; George Nedungatt, ''Clerics'', ''in'' A Guide to the Eastern Code 255, 260 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the word "Cleric" is also appropriate for [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] minor clergy who are tonsured in order not to trivialize orders such as those of Reader in the [[Eastern Church]], or for those who are tonsured yet have no minor or major orders. It is in this sense that the word entered the Arabic language, most commonly in Lebanon from the French, as ''kleriki'' (or, alternatively, ''cleriki'') meaning "[[seminarian]]." This is all in keeping with Eastern Orthodox concepts of clergy, which still include those who have not yet received, or do not plan to receive, the diaconate.

A priesthood is a body of [[priest]]s, [[shaman]]s, or [[oracle]]s who have special religious authority or function. The term priest is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[presbyter]] (πρεσβύτερος, ''presbýteros'', elder or senior), but is often used in the sense of [[Sacerdotalism|sacerdos]] in particular, i.e., for clergy performing [[ritual]] within the sphere of the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] or [[numinous]] communicating with the [[gods]] on behalf of the community.

== Buddhism ==
{{see also|Bhikkhu}}
[[File:Dalai Lama 1430 Luca Galuzzi 2007crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[14th Dalai Lama]], Tenzin Gyatso in 2007]]
[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clergy are often collectively referred to as the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], and consist of various orders of male and female monks (originally called [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s respectively). This diversity of monastic orders and styles was originally one community founded by [[Gautama Buddha]] during the 5th century BC living under a common set of rules (called the [[Vinaya]]). According to scriptural records, these celibate monks and nuns in the time of the Buddha lived an austere life of meditation, living as wandering beggars for nine months out of the year and remaining in retreat during the rainy season (although such a unified condition of [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]] is questioned by some scholars). However, as Buddhism spread geographically over time - encountering different cultures, responding to new social, political, and physical environments - this single form of Buddhist monasticism diversified. The interaction between Buddhism and Tibetan [[Bon]] led to a uniquely [[Tibetan Buddhism]], within which various sects, based upon certain teacher-student lineages arose. Similarly, the interaction between Indian Buddhist monks (particularly of the Southern [[Madhyamika]] School) and Chinese [[Confucian]] and [[Taoist]] monks from c200-c900AD produced the distinctive [[Ch'an]] Buddhism. Ch'an, like the Tibetan style, further diversified into various sects based upon the transmission style of certain teachers (one of the most well known being the 'rapid enlightenment' style of [[Linji Yixuan]]), as well as in response to particular political developments such as the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] and the Buddhist persecutions of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]]. In these ways, manual labour was introduced to a practice where monks originally survived on alms; layers of garments were added where originally a single thin robe sufficed; etc. This adaptation of form and roles of Buddhist monastic practice continued after the transmission to Japan. For example, monks took on administrative functions for the Emperor in particular secular communities (registering births, marriages, deaths), thereby creating Buddhist 'priests'. Again, in response to various historic attempts to suppress Buddhism (most recently during the [[Meiji Era]]), the practice of celibacy was relaxed and Japanese monks allowed to marry. This form was then transmitted to [[Korea]], during later Japanese occupation,&lt;ref&gt;[[Korean Buddhism#Buddhism during Japanese colonial rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; where celibate and non-celibate monks today exist in the same sects. (Similar patterns can also be observed in Tibet during various historic periods multiple forms of monasticism have co-existed such as "[[ngagpa]]" lamas, and times at which celibacy was relaxed). As these varied styles of Buddhist monasticism are transmitted to Western cultures, still more new forms are being created.

In general, the [[Mahayana]] schools of Buddhism tend to be more culturally adaptive and innovative with forms, while [[Theravada]] schools (the form generally practised in [[Thailand]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Sri Lanka]]) tend to take a much more conservative view of monastic life, and continue to observe precepts that forbid monks from touching women or working in certain secular roles. This broad difference in approach led to a major schism among Buddhist monastics in about the 4th century BCE, creating the [[Early Buddhist Schools]].

While female monastic (''[[bhikkhuni]]'') lineages existed in most Buddhist countries at one time, the [[Theravada]] lineages of Southeast Asia died out during the 14th-15th Century AD. As there is some debate about whether the bhikkhuni lineage (in the more expansive Vinaya forms) was transmitted to Tibet, the status and future of female Buddhist clergy in this tradition is sometimes disputed by strict adherents to the Theravadan style. Some Mahayana sects, notably in the United States (such as [[San Francisco Zen Center]]) are working to reconstruct the female branches of what they consider a common, interwoven lineage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfzc.org/sp_download/liturgy/35_Names_of_Women_Ancestors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of Buddhist traditions makes it difficult to generalize about Buddhist clergy. In the United States, [[Pure Land]] priests of the Japanese diaspora serve a role very similar to Protestant ministers of the Christian tradition. Meanwhile, reclusive Theravada forest monks in Thailand live a life devoted to meditation and the practice of austerities in small communities in rural Thailand- a very different life from even their city-dwelling counterparts, who may be involved primarily in teaching, the study of scripture, and the administration of the nationally organized (and government sponsored) Sangha. In the Zen traditions of China, Korea and Japan, manual labor is an important part of religious discipline; meanwhile, in the Theravada tradition, prohibitions against monks working as laborers and farmers continue to be generally observed.

Currently in North America, there are both celibate and non-celibate clergy in a variety of Buddhist traditions from around the world. In some cases they are forest dwelling monks of the Theravada tradition and in other cases they are married clergy of a Japanese Zen lineage and may work a secular job in addition to their role in the Buddhist community. There is also a growing realization that traditional training in ritual and meditation as well as philosophy may not be sufficient to meet the needs and expectations of American lay people. Some communities have begun exploring the need for training in counseling skills as well. Along these lines, at least two fully accredited Master of Divinity programs are currently available: one at Naropa University in Boulder, CO and one at the University of the West in Rosemead, CA.

==Christianity==
{{main article|Minister (Christianity)}}
In general, Christian clergy are [[ordained]]; that is, they are set apart for specific [[Catholic ministry|ministry]] in religious rites. Others who have definite roles in worship but who are not ordained (e.g. [[Laity|laypeople]] acting as [[acolytes]]) are generally not considered clergy, even though they may require some sort of official approval to exercise these ministries.

Types of clerics are distinguished from offices, even when the latter are commonly or exclusively occupied by clerics. A Roman Catholic cardinal, for instance, is almost without exception a cleric, but a cardinal is not a type of cleric. An archbishop is not a distinct type of cleric, but is simply a bishop who occupies a particular position with special authority. Conversely, a youth minister at a [[parish]] may or may not be a cleric. Different churches have different systems of clergy, though churches with similar [[ecclesiastical polity|polity]] have similar systems.

===Anglicanism===
{{main article|Anglican ministry}}
[[File:IEAB 2006 mauricio saulo crosier.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Bishop Maurício Andrade, [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], gives the [[crosier]] to Bishop Saulo Barros.]]
In [[Anglicanism]], clergy consist of the orders of [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s (presbyters) and [[bishop]]s in ascending order of seniority. ''[[Canon (priest)|Canon]]'', ''[[archdeacon]]'', ''[[archbishop]]'' and the like are specific positions within these orders. Bishops are typically overseers, presiding over a [[diocese]] composed of many [[parish]]es, with an archbishop presiding over a [[province]], which is a group of dioceses. A [[parish]] (generally a single church) is looked after by one or more priests, although one priest may be responsible for several parishes. New clergy are ordained deacons. Those seeking to become priests are usually ordained priest after a year. Since the 1960s some Anglican churches have reinstituted the diaconate as a permanent, rather than transitional, order of ministry focused on ministry that bridges the church and the world, especially ministry to those on the margins of society.

For the forms of address for Anglican clergy, see [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom]].

For a short period of history before the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops began within Anglicanism they could be "deaconesses". Although they were usually considered having a ministry distinct from deacons they often had similar ministerial responsibilities.

In Anglican churches all clergy are permitted to marry. In most national churches women may become deacons or priests, but while fifteen out of 38 national churches allow for the consecration of women as bishops, only five have ordained any. Celebration of the [[Eucharist]] is reserved for priests and bishops.

National Anglican churches are presided over by one or more [[primate (bishop)|primates]] or [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] (archbishops or presiding bishops). The senior archbishop of the [[Anglican Communion]] is the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who acts as leader of the [[Church of England]] and 'first among equals' of the primates of all Anglican churches.

Being a deacon, priest or bishop is considered a function of the person and not a job. When priests retire they are still priests even if they no longer have any active ministry. However, they only hold the basic rank after retirement. Thus a retired archbishop can only be considered a bishop (though it is possible to refer to 'Bishop John Smith, the former Archbishop of York'), a canon or archdeacon is a priest on retirement and does not hold any additional honorifics.

=== Catholicism ===
{{See also|Bishop (Catholic Church)|Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Deacon}}
[[File:Belgische Bisschoppen.jpg|thumb|[[Archbishop]] Karl-Josef Rauber, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Godfried Danneels]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] [[Roger Vangheluwe]] and Bishop [[Jozef De Kesel]]]]
[[Holy Orders|Ordained]] clergy in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are either deacons, priests, or bishops belonging to the diaconate, the presbyterate, or the episcopate, respectively. Among bishops, some are [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]], [[archbishop]]s, or [[patriarch]]s. The [[Pope]] is the Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], the supreme and universal hierarch of the Church, and his authorization is now required for the ordination of all Catholic bishops. With rare exceptions, [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] are bishops, although it was not always so; formerly, some cardinals were people who had received [[clerical tonsure]], but not [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]]. [[Secular clergy]] are ministers, such as deacons and priests, who do not belong to a religious institute and live in the world at large, rather than a religious institute ([[Secularity|''saeculum'']]). The [[Holy See]] supports the activity of its clergy by the [[Congregation for the Clergy]] ([http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/]), a [[dicastery]] of [[Roman curia]].

[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] indicates (canon 207) that "[b]y divine institution, there are among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PT.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, Canon 207 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction of a separate ministry was formed in the early times of Christianity; one early source reflecting this distinction, with the three ranks or orders of [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], [[presbyter|priest]] and [[deacon]], is the writings of Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]].

Holy Orders is one of the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]], enumerated at the [[Council of Trent]], that the Magisterium considers to be of divine institution. In the Roman Catholic Church, only men are permitted to be clerics, although in antiquity women were ordained to the diaconate{{dubious|date=July 2018}}.

In the [[Latin Church]] before 1972, [[tonsure]] admitted someone to the clerical state, after which he could receive the four [[minor orders]] (ostiary, lectorate, order of exorcists, order of acolytes) and then the [[major orders]] of [[subdeacon|subdiaconate]], diaconate, presbyterate, and finally the episcopate, which according to Roman Catholic doctrine is "the fullness of Holy Orders". Since 1972 the minor orders and the subdiaconate have been replaced by [[Catholic ministry|lay ministries]] and clerical tonsure no longer takes place, except in some [[Traditionalist Catholic]] groups, and the clerical state is acquired, even in those groups, by Holy Orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html|title=Ministeria quaedam - Disciplina circa Primam Tonsuram, Ordines Minores et Subdiaconatus in Ecclesia Latina innovatur, Litterae Apostolicae Motu Proprio datae, Die 15 m. Augusti a. 1972, Paulus PP.VI - Paulus PP. VI|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Latin Church the initial level of the three ranks of Holy Orders is that of the diaconate. In addition to these three orders of clerics, some [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]], or "Uniate", Churches have what are called "minor clerics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X|title=Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum orientalium, die XVIII Octobris anno MCMXC - Ioannes Paulus PP. II - Ioannes Paulus II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]] and [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]] are clerics only if they have received Holy Orders. Thus, unordained monks, [[friar]]s, [[nun]]s, and religious brothers and [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s are not part of the clergy.

The Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches prescribe that every cleric must be enrolled or "[[incardination and excardination|incardinated]]" in a [[diocese]] or its equivalent (an [[apostolic vicariate]], [[territorial abbey]], [[personal prelature]], etc.) or in a [[religious institute]], [[society of apostolic life]] or [[secular institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PX.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X|title=Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum orientalium, die XVIII Octobris anno MCMXC - Ioannes Paulus PP. II - Ioannes Paulus II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for this requirement arose because of the trouble caused from the earliest years of the Church by unattached or vagrant clergy subject to no ecclesiastical authority and often causing scandal wherever they went.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green, ''New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law'' (Paulist Press 2002 {{ISBN|9780809140664}}), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Current canon law prescribes that to be ordained a priest, an education is required of two years of [[philosophy]] and four of [[theology]], including study of dogmatic and moral theology, the Holy Scriptures, and canon law have to be studied within a [[seminary]] or an ecclesiastical faculty at a university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__PW.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html#TITULUS_X Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 342-356]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholicism mandates [[clerical celibacy]] for all clergy in the predominant [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]], with the exception of deacons who do not intend to become priests. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination of married men to the [[bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopacy]] is excluded (see [[Personal ordinariate#Married former Anglican clergy and rules on celibacy|personal ordinariate]]). [[Clerical marriage]] is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some [[particular Church]] celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy only for bishops.

In the [[High Middle Ages]], clergy in [[Western Europe]] had four privileges:{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
# '''Right of Canon''': whoever committed real violence on the person of a cleric committed a [[sacrilege]]. This decree was issued in a Lateran Council of 1097 (requested by [[Pope Urban II]]), then renewed in the [[Second Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council II]] (1139)
# '''Right of Forum''': by this right clergy could be judged by ecclesiastical [[tribunal]]s only. [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Emperor Constantine I]] granted this right for bishops, which was subsequently extended to the rest of the clergy by Imperial Decree
# '''Right of Immunity''': clergy could not be called for military service or other duties or charges incompatible with their role
# '''Right of Competence''': a certain part of the income of clergy, necessary for sustenance, could not be sequestered by any action of creditors

===Latter-day Saints===
{{Main article|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has no dedicated clergy, and is governed instead by a system of lay priesthood leaders. Locally, unpaid and part-time [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood holders]] lead the church; the worldwide church is supervised by full-time [[General authority|general authorities]], some of whom receive modest living allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/11/questions-and-answers?lang=eng|title=Questions and Answers - ensign|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/General_Authorities "General Authorities,"] [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]], p. 539&lt;/ref&gt; No formal theological training is required for any position. All leaders in the church are called by [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] and the [[laying on of hands]] by one who holds authority. [[Jesus Christ]] stands at the head of the church and leads the church through revelation given to the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]], the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Twelve Apostles]], all of whom are recognized as [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]] and have lifetime tenure. Below these men in the hierarchy are [[quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] of [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]], which are assigned geographically over the [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]] of the church. Locally, the church is divided into [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]]; each stake has a [[stake president|president]], who is assisted by two counselors and a [[high council (Latter Day Saints)|high council]]. The stake is made up of several individual congregations, which are called "[[ward (LDS Church)|wards]]" or "branches." Wards are led by a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] and his counselors and branches by a [[branch president|president]] and his counselors. Local leaders serve in their positions until released by their supervising authorities.&lt;ref&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [http://www.mormon.org/faq/no-paid-clergy "Why Don't Mormons Have Paid Clergy?"], mormon.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, all worthy males age 12 and above receive the [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]]. Youth age 12 to 18 are ordained to the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] as [[deacon (Latter Day Saints)|deacons]], [[teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teachers]], or [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]], which authorizes them to perform certain [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and sacraments. Adult males are ordained to the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]], as [[elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]], seventies, [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]], or [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|patriarchs]] in that priesthood, which is concerned with spiritual leadership of the church. Although the term "clergy" is not typically used in the LDS Church, it would most appropriately apply to local bishops and stake presidents. Merely holding an office in the priesthood does not imply authority over other church members or agency to act on behalf of the entire church.

=== Orthodoxy ===
{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=organization}}
[[File:Orthodox clergy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] clergy: [[bishop]] (right, at [[altar]]), [[priest]] (left), and two [[deacon]]s (in gold)]]
[[File:StMichaelEOTC03b.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ethiopian Orthodox]] clergy lead a procession in celebration of [[Saint Michael]] ]]

The [[Orthodox Church]] has three ranks of holy orders: bishop, priest, and deacon. These are the same offices identified in the [[New Testament]] and found in the [[Early Church]], as testified by the writings of the [[Holy Fathers]]. Each of these ranks is ordained through the [[Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament) of the [[laying on of hands]] (called ''[[Christian laying on of hands|cheirotonia]]'') by bishops. Priests and deacons are ordained by their own [[diocesan bishop]], while bishops are [[consecration|consecrated]] through the laying on of hands of at least three other bishops.

Within each of these three ranks there are found a number of titles. Bishops may have the title of [[archbishop]], [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], and [[patriarch]], all of which are considered [[honorific]]s. Among the Orthodox, all bishops are considered equal, though an individual may have a place of higher or lower honor, and each has his place within the [[order of precedence]]. Priests (also called [[presbyter]]s) may (or may not) have the title of [[archpriest]], [[protopresbyter]] (also called "protopriest", or "protopope"), [[hieromonk]] (a [[monk]] who has been ordained to the priesthood) [[archimandrite]] (a senior hieromonk) and [[hegumen]] (abbot). Deacons may have the title of [[hierodeacon]] (a monk who has been ordained to the deaconate), [[archdeacon]] or [[protodeacon]].

The lower clergy are not ordained through ''cheirotonia'' (laying on of hands) but through a blessing known as ''cheirothesia'' (setting-aside). These clerical ranks are [[subdeacon]], [[Reader (liturgy)|reader]] and [[altar server]] (also known as [[taper-bearer]]). Some churches have a separate service for the blessing of a [[cantor (church)|cantor]].

Ordination of a bishop, priest, deacon or subdeacon must be conferred during the [[Divine Liturgy]] (Eucharist)—though in some churches it is permitted to ordain up through deacon during the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]]—and no more than a single individual can be ordained to the same rank in any one service. Numerous members of the lower clergy may be ordained at the same service, and their blessing usually takes place during the [[Little Hours]] prior to Liturgy, or may take place as a separate service. The blessing of readers and taper-bearers is usually combined into a single service. Subdeacons are ordained during the Little Hours, but the ceremonies surrounding his blessing continue through the Divine Liturgy, specifically during the [[Great Entrance]].

Bishops are usually drawn from the ranks of the archimandrites, and are required to be celibate; however, a non-monastic priest may be ordained to the episcopate if he no longer lives with his wife (following Canon XII of the [[Quinisext Council|Quinisext Council of Trullo]])&lt;ref&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-136.htm#P6201_1388746 CCEL.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary usage such a non-monastic priest is usually [[tonsure]]d to the monastic state, and then elevated to archimandrite, at some point prior to his consecration to the episcopacy. Although not a formal or canonical prerequisite, at present bishops are often required to have earned a university degree, typically but not necessarily in [[theology]].

Usual titles are ''Your Holiness'' for a patriarch (with ''Your All-Holiness'' reserved for the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]), ''Your Beatitude'' for an archbishop/metropolitan overseeing an [[autocephaly|autocephalous Church]], ''Your Eminence'' for an archbishop/metropolitan generally, ''Master'' or ''Your Grace'' for a bishop and ''Father'' for priests, deacons and monks,&lt;ref&gt;Clergy Etiquette [http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/praxis/clergy_etiquette.aspx Orthodoxinfo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; although there are variations between the various Orthodox Churches. For instance, in Churches associated with the Greek tradition, while the Ecumenical Patriarch is addressed as "Your All-Holiness," all other Patriarchs (and archbishops/metropolitans who oversee autocephalous Churches) are addressed as "Your Beatitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goarch.org/resources/etiquette|title=Forms of Addresses and Salutations for Orthodox Clergy - Parish &amp; Church Life - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=goarch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox priests, deacons, and subdeacons must be either married or celibate (preferably monastic) prior to ordination, but may not marry after ordination.  ''Re''marriage of clergy following divorce or widowhood is forbidden. Married clergy are considered as best-suited to staff parishes, as a priest with a family is thought better qualified to counsel his flock.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Parry, David Melling, Dimitri Brady, Sidney Griffith &amp; John Healey (eds.), 1999, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'', Oxford, pp116-7&lt;/ref&gt; It has been common practice in the Russian tradition for unmarried, non-monastic clergy to occupy academic posts.

=== Protestantism ===
[[File:LutheranClergy.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Lutheran pastor confirming the youth of his congregation]]
Clergy in [[Protestantism]] fill a wide variety of roles and functions. In many [[Religious denominations|denominations]], such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], the roles of clergy are similar to Roman Catholic or Anglican clergy, in that they hold an [[ordained]] pastoral or priestly office, administer the sacraments, proclaim the word, lead a local church or parish, and so forth. The [[Baptist]] tradition only recognizes two ordained positions in the church as being the elders (pastors) and deacons as outlined in the third chapter of I Timothy{{bibleref2c|1Tim|3}}  in the Bible. The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] ordains two types of [[presbyter]]s or elders, teaching (pastor) and ruling (leaders of the congregation which form a council with the pastors). Teaching elders are seminary trained and ordained as a presbyter and set aside on behalf of the whole denomination to the ministry of Word and Sacrament. Ordinarily, teaching elders are installed by a presbytery as pastor of a congregation. Ruling elders, after receiving training, may be commissioned by a presbytery to serve as a pastor of a congregation, as well as preach and administer sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). ''Book of Order: 2009-2011'' (Louisville: Office of the General Assembly), Form of Government, Chapter 6 and 14. See also {{cite web |url=http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307070026/http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-07 |title=Theology and Worship }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of being designated as a member of the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group. Some Protestant denominations, such as [[Methodism]], [[Presbyterianism]], and [[Lutheranism]], are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations. In other traditions, such as the [[Baptist]] and other [[Congregational]] groups, local churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the parent denominations typically maintain lists of suitable candidates seeking appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider these individuals when filling available positions.

Some Protestant denominations require that candidates for ordination be "licensed" to the ministry for a period of time (typically one to three years) prior to being ordained. This period typically is spent performing the duties of ministry under the guidance, supervision, and evaluation of a more senior, ordained minister. In some denominations, however, licensure is a permanent, rather than a transitional state for ministers assigned to certain specialized ministries, such as music ministry or youth ministry.

Many Protestant denominations reject the idea that the clergy are a separate category of people, but rather stress the ''priesthood of all believers''. Based on this theological approach, most Protestants do not have a [[sacrament]] of [[Holy Orders|ordination]] like the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] churches. Protestant ordination, therefore, can be viewed more as a public statement by the ordaining body that an individual possesses the theological knowledge, moral fitness, and practical skills required for service in that faith group's ministry. Some Lutheran churches form an exception to this rule, as the [[Book of Concord|Lutheran Book of Concord]] allows ordination to be received as a sacrament.

Some Protestant denominations dislike the word ''clergy'' and do not use it of their own leaders. Often they refer to their leaders as [[pastor]]s or [[Religious minister|minister]]s, titles that, if used, sometimes apply to the person only as long as he or she holds a particular office.

== Islam ==

[[Islam]], like [[Judaism]], has no clergy in the [[sacerdotal]] sense; there is no institution resembling the Christian priesthood. Islamic religious leaders  do not "serve as intermediaries between mankind and God",&lt;ref name="pipes-1983-38"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pipes |first1=Daniel |title=In the Path of God: Islam and Political Power |date=1983 |publisher=Routledge. |page=38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bK00DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;dq=clerics+in+Islam+are+more+like+rabbi+than+priest+daniel+pipes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2-camq7vbAhVk4YMKHQU1DSUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clerics%20in%20Islam%20are%20more%20like%20rabbi%20than%20priest%20daniel%20pipes&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have "process of ordination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

The title ''[[mullah]]'' (a Persian variation of the Arabic ''maula'', "master"), commonly translated "cleric" in the West and thought to be analogous to "priest" or "rabbi", is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious. The title ''[[sheikh]]'' ("elder") is used similarly.

Most of the religious titles associated with Islam are scholastic or academic in nature: they recognize the holder's exemplary knowledge of the theory and practice of ''ad-d&amp;iacute;n'' (religion), and do not confer any particular spiritual or sacerdotal authority. The most general such title is ''`alim'' (pl. ''[[Ulama|`ulamah]]''), or "scholar". This word describes someone engaged in advanced study of the traditional Islamic sciences ''(`ulum)'' at an Islamic university or ''[[Madrasa|madrasah jami`ah]]''. A scholar's opinions may be valuable to others because of his/her knowledge in religious matters; but such opinions should not generally be considered binding, infallible, or absolute, as the individual Muslim is directly responsible to God for his or her own religious beliefs and practice.
&lt;!--
There is no sacerdotal office corresponding to the Christian priest or Jewish ''kohen'', as there is no sacrificial rite of atonement comparable to the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Korban]]. [[Ritual slaughter]] or ''[[dhabihah]]'', including the ''qurban'' at ''[[Eid al-Adha|`Idu l-Ad'ha]],'' may be performed by any adult Muslim who is physically able and properly trained. Professional butchers may be employed, but they are not necessary; in the case of the ''qurban'', it is especially preferable to slaughter one's own animal if possible.
--&gt;

===Sunni===
[[File:Gérôme - Mufti Reading in His Prayer Stool.jpg|thumb|A [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] cleric ([[mufti]]) delivering a sermon on the [[Chair|kursi]]]]
The nearest analogue among Sunni Muslims to the parish priest or pastor, or to the "pulpit [[rabbi]]" of a synagogue, is called the ''imam khatib.'' This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices: leader ''(imam)'' of the congregational prayer, which in most mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher ''(khatib)'' of the sermon or ''khutba'' of the obligatory congregational prayer at midday every Friday. Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-established mosques ''imam khatib'' is a permanent part-time or full-time position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside authority – ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.,'' the national government, or the [[waqf]] which sustains the mosque. There is no ordination as such; the only requirement for appointment as an ''imam khatib'' is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam.

The title ''[[Hafiz (Qur'an)|hafiz]]'' (lit. "preserver") is awarded to one who has memorized the entire Qur'an, often by attending a special course for the purpose; the ''imam khatib'' of a mosque is frequently (though not always) a ''hafiz.''

There are several specialist offices pertaining to the study and administration of Islamic law or ''[[Sharia|shari`ah]].'' A scholar with a specialty in ''fiqh'' or jurisprudence is known as a ''[[faqih]]''. A ''[[qadi]]'' is a judge in an Islamic court. A ''[[mufti]]'' is a scholar who has completed an advanced course of study which qualifies him to issue judicial opinions or ''[[fatwa|fatawah]]''.

===Shia===
[[File:Nahavandi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Iranian people|Iranian]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] cleric and author Sheikh Ali Akbar Nahavandi.]]
In modern [[Shia Islam]], scholars play a more prominent role in the daily lives of Muslims than in Sunni Islam; and there is a hierarchy of higher titles of scholastic authority, such as ''[[Ayatollah]]''. Since around the mid-19th century, a more complex title has been used in [[Twelver]] Shi`ism, namely ''marjaʿ at-taqlid''. ''[[Marjaʿ]]'' (pl. ''marajiʿ'') means "source", and ''taqlid'' refers to religious emulation or imitation. Lay Shi`ah must identify a specific ''marjaʿ'' whom they emulate, according to his legal opinions ''(fatawah)'' or other writings. On several occasions, the ''Marjaʿiyyat'' (community of all ''marajiʿ'') has been limited to a single individual, in which case his rulings have been applicable to all those living in the Twelver Shi'ah world. Of broader importance has been the role of the ''mujtahid'', a cleric of superior knowledge who has the authority to perform ''[[ijtihad]]'' (independent judgment). Mujtahids are few in number, but it is from their ranks that the ''marajiʿ at-taqlid'' are drawn.

===Sufism===
[[File:Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indian people|Indian]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] cleric [[Ali Khan (Sufi)|Pir-o-Murshid Ali Khan]].]]
The spiritual guidance function known in many Christian denominations as "pastoral care" is fulfilled for many Muslims by a ''murshid'' ("guide"), a master of the spiritual sciences and disciplines known as ''tasawuf'' or [[Sufism]]. Sufi guides are commonly styled ''Shaikh'' in both speaking and writing; in North Africa they are sometimes called ''[[marabout]]s''. They are traditionally appointed by their predecessors, in an unbroken teaching lineage reaching back to [[Muhammad]]. (The lineal succession of guides bears a superficial similarity to Christian ordination and apostolic succession, or to Buddhist dharma transmission; but a Sufi guide is regarded primarily as a specialized teacher and Islam denies the existence of an earthly hierarchy among believers.)

Muslims who wish to learn Sufism dedicate themselves to a ''murshid''&amp;apos;s guidance by taking an oath called a ''[[Bay'ah|bai'ah]]''. The aspirant is then known as a ''murid'' ("disciple" or "follower"). A ''murid'' who takes on special disciplines under the guide's instruction, ranging from an intensive spiritual retreat to voluntary poverty and homelessness, is sometimes known as a [[dervish]].

During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], it was common for scholars to attain recognized mastery of both the "exterior sciences" ''(`ulum az-zahir)'' of the madrasahs as well as the "interior sciences" ''(`ulum al-batin)'' of Sufism. [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Rumi]] are two notable examples.

===Ahmadiyya===
The highest office an Ahmadi can hold is that of [[Khalifatul Masih|''Khalifatu l-Masih'']]. Such a person may appoint amirs who manage regional areas.&lt;ref&gt;The Muslim Resurgence in Ghana Since 1950: Nathan Samwini - 2003 p151&lt;/ref&gt; The consultative body for Ahmadiyya is called the ''Majlis-i-Shura'', which ranks second in importance to the ''Khalifatu l-Masih''.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaʻat: History, Belief, Practice'', p.93, Simon Ross Valentine, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ahmadiyya community is declared as [[Persecution of Ahmadis|non-Muslims]] by many mainstream Muslims and they reject the messianic claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.

== Judaism ==
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading Rabbinical authority for Orthodox Jewry]]
[[Rabbinic Judaism]] does not have clergy as such, although according to the [[Torah]] there is a tribe of priests known as the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] who were leaders of the religion up to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 AD when most [[Sadducee]]s were wiped out; each member of the tribe, a Kohen had priestly duties, many of which centered around the sacrificial duties, atonement and blessings of the Israelite nation. Today, Jewish Kohanim know their status by family tradition, and still offer the priestly blessing during certain services in the synagogue and perform the ''[[Pidyon haben]]'' (redemption of the first-born son) ceremony.

Since the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the religious leaders of Judaism have often been [[rabbi]]s, who are technically scholars in Jewish law empowered to act as judges in a [[Beth din|rabbinical court]]. All types of Judaism except Orthodox Judaism allow women as well as men to be ordained as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/106320/ |title=Orthodox Women To Be Trained As Clergy, If Not Yet as Rabbis – |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml |title=The Cantor |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leadership of a Jewish congregation is, in fact, in the hands of the laity: the president of a synagogue is its actual leader and any adult male Jew (or adult Jew in non-traditional congregations) can lead prayer services. The rabbi is not an occupation found in the Torah; the first time this word is mentioned is in the [[Mishnah]]. The modern form of the rabbi developed in the [[Talmud]]ic era. Rabbis are given authority to make interpretations of [[Halakha|Jewish law and custom]]. Traditionally, a man obtains one of three levels of [[Semicha]] (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of an arduous learning program in Torah, [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), Mishnah and Talmud, [[Midrash]], Jewish ethics and lore, the codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]] and [[responsa]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]].

[[File:ReginaJonas1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Regina Jonas]], the world's first female rabbi, ordained in 1935, killed in the [[Holocaust]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/jonas-regina |title=Jonas Regina}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the early medieval era an additional communal role, the ''[[Hazzan]]'' (cantor) has existed as well. Cantors have sometimes been the only functionaries of a synagogue, empowered to undertake religio-civil functions like witnessing marriages. Cantors do provide leadership of actual services, primarily because of their training and expertise in the music and prayer rituals pertaining to them, rather than because of any spiritual or "sacramental" distinction between them and the laity. Cantors as much as rabbis have been recognized by civil authorities in the United States as clergy for legal purposes, mostly for awarding education degrees and their ability to perform weddings, and certify births and deaths.

Additionally, Jewish authorities license ''[[mohel]]s'', people specially trained by experts in Jewish law and usually also by medical professionals to perform the ritual of circumcision.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/ |title=Making the cut &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional Orthodox Judaism does not license women as mohels, but other types of Judaism do. They are appropriately called ''mohelot'' (pl. of ''mohelet,'' f. of mohel)
[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/]. As the Jewish News Weekly of Northern California states, "...there is no halachic prescription against female mohels, [but] none exist in the Orthodox world, where the preference is that the task be undertaken by a Jewish man.".&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;

In many places, mohels are also licensed by civil authorities, as circumcision is technically a surgical procedure. Kohanim, who must avoid contact with dead human body parts (such as the removed foreskin) for ritual purity, cannot act as mohels, {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but some mohels are also either rabbis or cantors.

Another licensed cleric in Judaism is the ''[[shochet]]'', who are trained and licensed by religious authorities for [[kosher]] slaughter according to ritual law. A Kohen may be a shochet. Most shochetim are ordained rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grandin|first=Temple|year=1980|title=Problems With Kosher Slaughter|url=http://animalstudiesrepository.org/acwp_faafp/21/|journal=International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems|volume=1 |issue=6|pages=375–390|via=The Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then there is the ''[[mashgiach]]''. A ''mashgiach'' is someone who supervises the ''[[kashrut]]'' status of a kosher establishment. The ''mashgiach'' must know the Torah laws of ''kashrut'', and how they apply in the environment he is supervising. Obviously, this can vary. In many instances, the ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi. This helps, since rabbinical students learn the laws of kosher as part of their syllabus. However, not every ''mashgiach'' is a rabbi, and not every rabbi is qualified to be a ''mashgiach''.

=== Orthodox Judaism ===
In contemporary Orthodox Judaism, women are forbidden from becoming rabbis or cantors in the Orthodox world primarily because this would affect many aspects of communal observances and practices .{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Most Orthodox rabbinical seminaries or yeshivas also require dedication of many years to education, but few require a formal degree from a civil education institutions that often define Christian clergy. Training is often focused on Jewish law, and some Orthodox Yeshivas forbid secular education.

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], generally understood as a branch of Orthodox Judaism, there are dynastic spiritual leaders known as ''[[Rebbe]]s'', often translated in English as "Grand Rabbi". The office of Rebbe is generally a hereditary one, may also be passed from Rebbe to student, or recognized by a congregation conferring a sort of coronation to their new Rebbe. Although one does not need to be an ordained Rabbi to be a Rebbe, most Rebbes today are ordained Rabbis. Since one does not need to be an ordained rabbi to be a Rebbe, at some points in history there were female Rebbes as well, particularly the [[Maiden of Ludmir]].

=== Conservative Judaism ===
In [[Conservative Judaism]], both men and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors. Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as binding but also as subject to many interpretations, including more liberal interpretations. Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous.  First earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and [[rabbinic literature]], philosophy and theology, liturgy, Jewish history, and Hebrew literature of all periods.

=== Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism ===
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] do not maintain the traditional requirements for study as rooted in Jewish Law and traditionalist text. Both men and women may be rabbis or cantors. The rabbinical seminaries of these movements hold that one must first earn a bachelor's degree before entering the rabbinate. In addition studies are mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism; and academic biblical criticism. Emphasis is placed not on Jewish law, but rather on sociology, modern Jewish philosophy, Theology and Pastoral Care.

== Sikhism ==
[[Sikh]] clergy consists of five ''[[Jathedar]]s'', one each from five ''[[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]]'' or sacred seats. The ''Jathedars'' are appointed by the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC), an elected body of the Sikhs sometimes called the "Parliament of Sikhs." The highest seat of the Sikh religion is called ''[[Akal Takht]]'' and the ''Jathedar'' of ''Akal Takht'' makes all the important decisions after consultations with the ''Jathedars'' of the other four ''takhts'' and the SGPC.

==Traditional religions==
{{See also|Imperial cult}}

Historically [[Ethnic religion|traditional]] (or ''[[pagan]]'') religions typically combine religious authority and political power. What this means is that the [[sacred king|sacred king or queen]] is therefore seen to combine both kingship and priesthood within his or her person, even though he or she is often aided by an actual high priest or priestess (see, for example, the [[Maya priesthood]]). When the functions of political ruler and religious leader are combined in this way, [[Apotheosis|deification]] could be seen to be the next logical stage of his or her social advancement within his or her native environment, as is found in the case of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]]s. The [[Vedic priesthood]] of India is an early instance of a structured body of clergy organized as a separate and hereditary caste, one that occupied the highest social rung of its nation. A modern example of this phenomenon the priestly monarchs of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] holy city of [[Ile-Ife]] in [[Nigeria]], whose reigning [[List of rulers of Ife|Oni]]s have performed ritual ceremonies for centuries for the sustenance of the entire planet and its people.

== Health risks for ministry in the United States ==

In recent years, studies have suggested that American clergy in certain [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions are more at risk than the general population of obesity, hypertension and depression. Their life expectancies have fallen in recent years and in the last decade their use of antidepressants has risen.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Several religious bodies in the United States ([[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], [[Baptists|Baptist]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]) have implemented measures to address the issue, through [[Workplace wellness|wellness]] campaigns, for example - but also by simply ensuring that clergy take more time off. It is unclear whether similar symptoms affect American [[Islam|Muslim]] clerics, although an anecdotal comment by one American imam suggested that leaders of mosques may also share these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/nyregion/02burnout.html?scp=1&amp;sq=clergy&amp;st=cse|title=Evidence Grows of Problem of Clergy Burnout|first=Paul|last=Vitello|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception to the findings of these studies is the case of American [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests, who are required by [[canon law]] to take a spiritual retreat each year, and four weeks of vacation. Sociological studies at the [[University of Chicago]] have confirmed this exception; the studies also took the results of several earlier studies into consideration and included Roman Catholic priests nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;
See A. M. Greeley, ''Priests: A Calling in Crisis'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004).
&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear whether American clergy in other religious traditions experience the same symptoms, or whether clergy outside the United States are similarly affected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10776">'''Comparative theology''' is a relatively new discipline within [[theology]], which holds together "comparative" and "theology" in creative tension.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=11}} It represents a particular type of theological practice committed to deep interreligious learning ("comparative") while staying rooted in a particular religious tradition ("theology"). Moreover, while many of its proponents come from the [[Christianity|Christian]] religious tradition, it can have as a starting point the theology of any religious tradition.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=11}}

== Relations to other disciplines ==
[[File:Francis X. Clooney.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis X. Clooney]], a leading exponent of comparative theology]]
[[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis X. Clooney]], a leading figure within comparative theology, sees comparative theology essentially as "faith seeking understanding".{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=9}} He explains the distinctiveness of comparative theology by clarifying the relationship between comparative theology and the related disciplines of [[comparative religion]], [[theology of religions]], and [[interfaith dialogue|interreligious dialogue]].{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=9–16}}

=== Comparative theology vs. comparative religion ===
Comparative theology shares with [[comparative religion]] an interest in the comparative study of religion. However, in contrast to comparative religion, which seeks to examine the similarities and differences between a variety of religious traditions from a neutral point of view, comparative theology focuses on the theological reflection of one's own religion in light of the insights from another religious tradition. Rather than emphasizing a religiously-detached position,{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=9}} comparative theology is deeply rooted in a particular religious tradition. Francis X. Clooney explains:{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=10}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Comparative theology – comparative and theological beginning to end – marks acts of faith seeking understanding which are rooted in a particular faith tradition but which, from that foundation, venture into learning from one or more other faith traditions. This learning is sought for the sake of fresh theological insights that are indebted to the newly encountered tradition/s as well as the home tradition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Comparative theology vs. theology of religion ===
Comparative theology shares with [[theology of religions]] a theological interest in the encounter between Christian faith and other religions; but from a different angle, and with a different emphasis and aim. Theology of religion attempts to clarify the relationship between Christian faith and other religious traditions with regard to how other religions can be understood in light of normative claims of Christian faith, in particular, related to salvation and Christ.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=15}} Theology of religion thus reflects from Christian theological claims, based on general descriptions of other religious traditions.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=14}} In contrast to this, comparative theology is a theology of religious learning. It emphasizes an in-depth study of the particularities of other religious traditions instead of basing itself on general descriptions.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=15}} "Comparative theology is not primarily about which religion is the true one, but about learning across religious borders in a way that discloses the truth of my faith, in the light of their faith."{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=15–16}}

=== Comparative theology vs. interreligious dialogue ===
Comparative theology shares with [[Interfaith dialogue|interreligious dialogue]] a commitment to engage in dialogue and listen carefully to the religious other. It must, however, go further than just listening: "The comparative theologian must do more than listen to others explain their faith; she must be willing to study their traditions deeply alongside her own, taking both to heart."{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=13}}

== Sources and methodology ==
The unique character of comparative theology derives from its sources and methodology.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=40}}

Comparative theology works with two types of religious sources. While rooted in one tradition, comparative theology has its foundation also in at least one additional religious tradition. Clooney describes comparative theology&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . as truly [[constructive theology]], distinguished by its sources and ways of proceeding, by its foundation in more than one tradition (although the comparativist always remains rooted in one tradition), and by reflection which builds on that foundation, rather than simply on themes or by methods already articulated prior to comparative practice.{{sfn|Clooney|1995|p=522}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Rigveda_MS2097.jpg|thumb|''[[Rigveda]]'' manuscript in [[Devanagari]]]]
Comparative theology is dialectical practice. The comparison starts with a critical study of the other religion.{{sfn|Fredericks|2010|p=xi}} This first step involves a persistent and disciplined in-depth study of the other religious tradition where the theologian exposes herself to the sacred texts of the other tradition. The comparative theologian practices "hermeneutical openness" in a manner where comprehension should precede judgment.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=40}} This implies a "[[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing]]" of subjective commitments / theological judgments, allowing the other religious tradition to speak as much as possible on its own terms.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=44}} It is a practice of making oneself "vulnerable to intellectual, imaginative, affective transformation."{{sfn|Clooney|2008|p=208}}

The comparison, in turn, becomes a conversation with your own tradition.{{sfn|Fredericks|2010|p=xi}} The insights emerging from the encounter with the other religious tradition might influence the conceptual framework for interpreting your own tradition, causing a reconsideration of your Christian identity. Correlations are made between the two traditions, which might imply recognition of similarities or recognition of differences.{{sfn|Fredericks|2010|p=xi}} At this point "the 'normative theological judgments' that were temporarily suspended are brought back into the hermeneutical circle."{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=45}} Grounds are provided for raising more profound theological questions, conversation with other theologians, and potentially leading to new theological construction. This theological procedure resonates with Clooney's claim that&lt;blockquote&gt;Comparative theology is a theology deeply changed by its attention to the details of multiple religious and theological traditions, a theology that occurs only after comparison.{{sfn|Clooney|1995|p=522}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Contemporary theology has, so far, been mainly a text-based discipline, and comparative theologians engage primarily with texts from one religious tradition outside their own, due to the in-depth study that is required.{{sfn|Moyaert|2012|p=40}} Although associated with Christian theology, the approach applied in comparative theology is not particularly Christian and can be a practiced grounded in other religious traditions as well.{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|p=11}}

== History and key figures ==
[[File:Roberto de Nobili (1577-1656), gravure.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roberto de Nobili]] (1577–1656), [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary to [[India]]]]
Comparative theology has historical forerunners in figures such as the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Roberto de Nobili]].{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=27–29}}

Since the 1980s, comparative theology has developed as a particular theological response to the growing religious diversity in the contemporary world. It has been introduced by [[Francis X. Clooney]] and [[James L. Fredericks]], and is a methodology used by individuals such as [[David Tracy]], [[Keith Ward]], and [[Robert C. Neville]].{{sfn|Clooney|2010a|pp=41–53}} The discipline arose through the growing impact of Alan Race's three-fold understanding of [[Theology of religions#Basic Three-Point Model|theology of religions]], that resulted in various arguments about the benefits of the models of theology of religions.{{sfn|Knitter|2005}}

A new generation of comparative theologians is today expanding the discourse, drawing it in new directions.{{sfn|Clooney|2010b}}

The "'''conflict thesis'''" is a [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] which maintains that there is an intrinsic intellectual conflict between [[religion]] and [[science]] and that the [[relationship between religion and science]] inevitably leads to hostility; examples to support this thesis have commonly been drawn from the relations between science and religion in Western Europe.

== The historical conflict thesis ==
[[File:John William Draper.jpg|right|thumb|John William Draper]]
[[File:Andrew Dickson White 1885.jpg|right|thumb|Andrew Dickson White]]
In the 1800s the relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional interactions were expressed in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=9780674057418|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it was around the mid-1800s that discussion of "science and religion" first emerged because before this time, "science" still included moral and metaphysical dimensions, was not inherently linked to the [[scientific method]], and the term "scientist" did not emerge until 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|isbn=022618448X|chapter=6. Professing Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist [[John William Draper]] and the writer [[Andrew Dickson White]] were the most influential exponents of the conflict thesis between religion and science. Draper had been the speaker in the [[British Association]] [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|meeting of 1860]] which led to the famous confrontation between Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce|Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] over [[Darwinism]], and in America "the religious controversy over biological evolution reached its most critical stages in the late 1870s".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Post-Darwinian Controversies|first= James R. |last= Moore|page= 10|publisher=|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ppXB4mBY05AC}} quoting Schlesinger. But see also James C. Ungureanu, "A Yankee at Oxford: John William Draper at the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford, 30 June 1860," ''Notes and Records: The Royal Society Journal of the History of Science '' (Dec 2015).
&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1870s Draper was invited by American science popularizer Edward Livingston Youmans to write a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), a book replying to contemporary issues in Roman Catholicism, such as the [[papal infallibility|doctrine of papal infallibility]], and mostly criticizing what he claimed to be [[anti-intellectualism]] in [[Roman Catholicism|the Catholic tradition]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, D (2001), ''Rebuilding the Matrix'', Lion Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7459-5116-3}} (pg. 217)&lt;/ref&gt; but also making criticisms of [[Islam]] and of [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;
"Averroes, in his old age - he died A. D. 1193 - was expelled from Spain; the religious party had triumphed over the philosophical. He was denounced as a traitor to religion.  An opposition to philosophy had been organized all over the Mussulman world. There was hardly a philosopher who was not punished." (p142) "The two rival divisions of the Christian Church - Protestant and Catholic - were thus in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered to be agreeable to the Scriptures." (p218)
&lt;/ref&gt; Draper's preface summarises the conflict thesis:

{{quotation|The history of Science is not a mere record of  isolated discoveries; it is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, ''History of the Conflict Religion'', D. Appleton and Co. (1881)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1874 White published his thesis in [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 8/February 1876/The Warfare of Science I|Popular Science Monthly]] and in book form as ''The Warfare of Science'':

{{quotation|In all modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest of religion, no matter how conscientious such interference may have been, has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science—and invariably. And, on the other hand, all untrammeled scientific investigation, no matter how dangerous to religion some of its stages may have seemed, for the time, to be, has invariably resulted in the highest good of religion and of science.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title= The Warfare of Science|first= Andrew Dickson|last= White|year= 1876|page= 8|url= https://archive.org/details/warfareofscience00whituoft}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1896, White published ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'', the culmination of over thirty years of research and publication on the subject, criticizing what he saw as restrictive, dogmatic forms of [[Christianity]]. In the introduction, White emphasized that he arrived at his position after the difficulties of assisting [[Ezra Cornell]] in establishing a university without any official religious affiliation.

[[James Joseph Walsh]], M.D., the historian of medicine, criticized White's perspective as anti-historical in [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC22760194&amp;id=B-cQAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22popes+and+science%22 ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time''] (1908),&lt;ref&gt;Fordam University Press, 1908, Kessinger Publishing, reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|0-7661-3646-9}}  Reviews: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=02tZKPD5CJrIa31EgK&amp;id=G57Y1rlQVP0C&amp;pg=PT2&amp;lpg=PT2&amp;dq=%22the+popes+and+science%22] [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1407075]&lt;/ref&gt; a book dedicated to [[Pope Pius X]]:

{{quotation|the story of the supposed opposition of the Church and the Popes and the ecclesiastical authorities to science in any of its branches, is founded entirely on mistaken notions. Most of it is quite imaginary. Much of it is due to the exaggeration of the significance of the [[Galileo affair|Galileo incident]]. Only those who know nothing  about the history of medicine and of science continue to harbor it. That Dr. White's book, contradicted as it is so directly by all serious histories of medicine and of science, should have been read by so many thousands in this country, and should have been taken seriously by educated men, physicians, teachers, and even professors of science who want to know the history of their own sciences, only shows how easily even supposedly educated men may be led to follow their prejudices rather than their mental faculties, and emphasizes the fact that the tradition that there is no good that can possibly come out of the Nazareth of the times before the reformation, still dominates the intellects of many educated people who think that they are far from prejudice and have minds perfectly open to conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, James Joseph, ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time'', Fordam University Press, New York 1908, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''God and Nature'' (1986), [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] report that "White's ''Warfare'' apparently did not sell as briskly as Draper's ''Conflict'', but in the end it proved more influential, partly, it seems, because Draper's strident anti-Catholicism soon dated his work and because White's impressive documentation gave the appearance of sound scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers, ''God &amp; Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science'', University of California Press (April 29, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, historians' acceptance of the conflict thesis declined until rejected in the 1970s. David B. Wilson notes:

{{quotation|Despite the growing number of scholarly modifications and rejections of the conflict model from the 1950's ... in the 1970s leading historians of the nineteenth century still felt required to attack it. ...

In his course on science and religion, historian Lawrence Principe summarizes Draper's and White's works by saying, "While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White’s writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that.  Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion.  Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds.  And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities."
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the coursebook, Principe writes, "No serious historians of science or of the science-religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis...The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men - John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White.  These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable."
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=7}}


Regarding the scholarship of Draper's work, Principe says
{{quotation|How does he [John William Draper] support his contention of conflict?  Well, unfortunately, with some of the worst historical writing you are ever likely to come across.  Historical facts are confected, causes and chronologies twisted to the author’s purpose.  We find interpretations made merely by declaration.  We find quotations violently taken out of context.  And instances, quite a few of them where Draper claims a historical writer said something in fact 180 degrees away from what he actually claimed...Much of Draper’s book is so ridiculous, so malodramatic, so rabid, it’s hard for a knowledgeable person actually to read it without a wry smirk...Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat.  Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children.  The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC.  And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Principe's summary comment on Draper's work at the end of his coursebook reads: "The book that started the conflict myth.  Take a sense of humor and/or a stiff drink with this dated bit of melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Academic===

Historians of science today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (those involving Galileo and Darwin) in favor of a "complexity" model, because religious figures took positions on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved in discrediting religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Richard H.|title= For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science|year= 2011|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 9780761855668|pages= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said: "White's and Draper's accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly.

Russell]], the former President of [[Christians in Science]], said that "Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study.

In ''Science &amp; Religion'', Gary Ferngren proposes a complex relationship between religion and science:

{{quotation|While some historians had always regarded the Draper-White thesis as oversimplifying and distorting a complex relationship, in the late twentieth century it underwent a more systematic reevaluation.  The result is the growing recognition among historians of science that the relationship of religion and science has been much more positive than is sometimes thought.  Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization.  If [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] and the [[Scopes trial]] come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor).

Some modern historians of science (such as Peter Barker, [[Bernard R. Goldstein]], and Crosbie Smith) propose that scientific discoveries - such as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] in the 17th century, and the reformulation of physics in terms of [[energy]], in the 19th century - were driven by religion.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Peter, and Goldstein, Bernard R. "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy". ''Osiris'', Volume 16: ''Science in Theistic Contexts'',  University of Chicago Press, 2001, pp. 88–113; Smith, Crosbie.  ''The Science of Energy: A Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain''.  London: The Athlone PRess, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious organizations and clerics figure prominently in the broad histories of science, until the [[profession]]alization of the scientific enterprise, in the 19th century, led to tensions between scholars taking religious and secular approaches to nature.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the chapters on "Geology and Paleontology" (by Nicolaas A. Rupke), "Natural History" (by Peter M. Hess), and "Charles Darwin" (by James Moore) in Gary Ferngren (ed.), ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the prominent examples of religion's apparent conflict with science, the [[Galileo affair]] (1614) and the [[Scopes trial]] (1925), were not pure instances of conflict between science and religion, but included personal and political facts in the development of each conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Richard J., "Galileo Galilei", ''Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction''; Larson, Edward J.

{{main|Galileo affair}}
The Galileo affair is one of the few examples commonly used by advocates of the conflict thesis. Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of "the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion," and that this view promotes "the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion." Finocchiaro writes, "I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic," and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo "saw" the earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was "imprisoned," since he was "actually held under house arrest."&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt; He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included scientific, philosophical, and theological arguments.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /&gt;

The Galileo affair was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610,&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=wKCZFJuMCaQC&amp;pg=PA1 p.1]): "By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref name=h218&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy. Urban may have rather viewed Heliocentrism as a potentially dangerous or rash doctrine that nevertheless had utility in astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name="Trial Galileo Essential"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo : Essential Documents|date=2014|isbn=1624661327|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632 Galileo, now an old man, published his  ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was popular. Pope Urban VIII had asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book, and were voiced by a character named ''Simplicio'' who was a simpleton.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than on Pope Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in [[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|''The Sleepwalkers'']] [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This angered the Pope and weakened Galileo's position politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Lindberg|first = David|title = Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to mounting controversy over [[theology]], [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]], the [[Roman Inquisition]] tried Galileo in 1633 and found him "vehemently suspect of [[heresy]]", sentencing him to [[indefinite imprisonment]]. Galileo's ''Dialogue'' was banned, the publication of his past or future works forbidden, he was ordered to "abjure, curse and detest" heliocentric ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–293).&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo was kept under house arrest until his death in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.367)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p.184)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 (1905, 16:209,] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230419/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=209 |date=September 27, 2007 }} [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 230)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234122/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=16&amp;VOLPAG=230 |date=September 27, 2007 }}{{it icon}}.

===Scientist and public perceptions===

This thesis is still held to be true in whole or in part by some prominent contemporary scientists such as [[Stephen Hawking]] who has said "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HEUSSNER|first1=KI MAE|title=Stephen Hawking on Religion: 'Science Will Win'|website=ABC News|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Steven Weinberg]], grant that it is possible for science and religion to be compatible since some prominent scientists are also religious, but he sees some significant tensions that potentially weaken religious beliefs overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Lake Views: This World and the Universe|date=2011|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=0674062302|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done on scientists from 21 American universities showed that most did not perceive conflict between science and religion. In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict. However, those not attending religious services were more likely to adopt a conflict paradigm. Additionally, scientists were more likely to reject conflict thesis if their peers held positive views of religion.&lt;ref name="scientists religion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|author2=Park, Jerry Z. |title=Conflict Between Religion and Science Among Academic Scientists?|year=2009|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=48|issue=2|pages=276–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01447.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Ronald Numbers]] suggests the conflict theory lingers in a popular belief, inclusive of scientists and clerics alike, and that while history reflects an intrinsic and inevitable intellectual conflict between (Judeo-Christian) religion and science, it is perpetuated by the [[polemic]]s surrounding controversies involving [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution]], [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]], and [[birth control]].&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Ronald Numbers]] (Lecturer) | date=May 11, 2006 | url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | title=Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective | medium=Video Lecture | location=University of Cambridge (Howard Building, Downing College) | publisher=The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious groups have made statements regarding the compatibility of religion and science,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncse.com/media/voices/religion|title=Statements from Religious Organizations|date=2008-09-08|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging, for example, "school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ncse.com/media/voices/188-wisconsin-clergy|title=188 Wisconsin Clergy|date=2008-09-08|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Magis Center for Reason and Faith was founded specifically to apply science in support of belief in a deity and the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.magiscenter.com/science-reason-faith/|title=Science, Reason &amp; Faith|work=Magis Center|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars such as Brian Stanley and [[Denis Alexander]] propose that [[mass media]] are partly responsible for popularizing conflict theory,&lt;ref&gt;"Templeton Foundation Post-dinner Discussion", after the ''Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective'' lecture Ronald Numbers, 11 May 2006, at St Edmunds College, Cambridge; the transcript is available at http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/CIS/Numbers/&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the [[Flat-earth myth]] that prior to [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] people believed the Earth was flat.&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;Jeffrey Russell.

Research on perceptions of science among the American public concludes that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science, and that they have no differences with nonreligious groups in propensity to seek out scientific knowledge, although there may be epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–727|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–353|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Center]] made similar findings and also noted that the majority of Americans (80–90%) strongly support scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter |author2=Gregory Smith |author3=David Masci |pages=1–2, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to express very favorable views towards science.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415873697|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |page=336,345–346|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists.

XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication, Bellarmine was regarded as Rome's foremost apologist on doctrine and [[Papacy|papal power]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written while Bellarmine was lecturing at the [[Roman College]], and was first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in three volumes (1581, 1582, 1593)&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; or four.&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726143537/http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various controversies of the time, and made an immense impression throughout Europe, the strength of its arguments against [[Protestantism]] so acutely felt in Germany and England that special chairs were founded in order to provide replies to it.&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/r/robert_francis_romulus_bellarmine,saint.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]],&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; [[Theodore Beza]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rainolds]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"/&gt; were among those who wrote counter-arguments against the work.

The first volume treats of the [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]], of [[Christ]], and of the [[pope]]; the second of the authority of [[ecumenical council]]s, and of the [[Church (Christian)|Church]], whether militant, suffering, or triumphant; the third of the [[sacrament]]s; and the fourth of [[Divine grace]], [[free will]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and [[good works]].&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;

As much as Protestants disliked Bellarmine's theories, he was in fact moderate in his defence of papal power. In 1590, [[Pope Sixtus V]] had, or very nearly had,&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycatholic.org/issue/2003Sep/sep14doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the first volume placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] for denying temporal hegemony to the papacy. Bellarmine's reasoning was that though the pope is the vicar of Christ, since Christ did not ''exercise'' his [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], nor may the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important part of the work is contained in the five books regarding the pope. In these, after a speculative introduction on forms of [[government]] in general, holding [[monarchy]] to be relatively the best, Bellarmine says that a monarchical government and the related temporal power are necessary for the Church, to preserve unity and order in it.

Such power Bellarmine considers to have been established by the commission of Christ to [[Saint Peter]]. He then proceeds to demonstrate that this power has been transmitted to the successors of Peter, admitting that a heretical pope may be freely judged and deposed by the Church since by the very fact of his [[Christian heresy|heresy]] he would cease to be pope, or even a member of the Church.

The third section discusses the [[Antichrist]]. Bellarmine gives in full the theory set forth by the [[Church Fathers]], of a personal Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be accepted by the [[Jew]]s and enthroned in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]—thus endeavoring to dispose of the Protestant exposition which saw in the pope the Antichrist.

The fourth section sets forth the pope as the supreme judge in matters of faith and morals, though making the concessions that the pope may err in questions of fact which may be known by ordinary human knowledge, and also when he speaks as a mere unofficial theologian. Bellarmine took in particular the example of [[Pope Honorius I]], who had been anathemized by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] as holding to [[monothelitism]]. He claimed that although monothelitism had been rightly condemned, Honorius was however orthodox as he had not really held these views, and that papal authority did not extend itself to the factual interpretation of what was to be found in Honorius or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/p27pr/part17.html 17th Letter] of the [[Provincial Letters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation into English==

Though several books of this work have been translated into English in the past, only recently is it seeing its first complete translation project in full, in an English translation made by Ryan Grant. Several parts of the work have been translated, and the whole project will be resumed to after the translation project of Theologia Moralis by [[ Saint Alphonsus Liguori]] is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Robert Bellarmine Translation Project|url=https://mediatrixpress.com/?page_id=21|website=Mediatrix Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equanimity''' ([[Latin]]: ''æquanimitas'', having an even mind; ''aequus'' even; ''animus'' mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.  The [[virtue]] and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of  major religions and ancient philosophies.
{{wikt}}

==Etymology==
From Fr. ''équanimité'', from L. ''aequanimitatem'' (nom. ''aequanimitas'') "evenness of mind, calmness," from ''aequus'' "even, level" (see equal) + ''animus'' "mind, spirit" (see animus). Meaning "evenness of temper" in English is from 1610s.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व ''[[samatva]]m'' (also rendered ''samatva'' or ''samata'').&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' one reads: ''yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate''. [[Srila Prabhupada]] translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita As it Is'', A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;
                
In his book ''Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity'', [[Swami Sivananda]] states: 

"An aspirant who treads the path to ''samatvam'' must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: ''[[Viveka]]'', discrimination; ''[[vairagya]]'', dispassion; ''shadsampat'', the six virtues (''shama'', mental calmness and control; ''dama'', restraint of the senses; ''[[uparati]]'', sense withdrawal or ''[[pratyahara]]''; ''[[titiksha]]'', endurance; ''shraddha'', faith and ''[[samadhana]]'', mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, ''mumukshutva''. In order to possess the virtue of ''Samatvam'', he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career..."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3, "The Pathway to Samatvam", ''Samatvam: The Yoga of Equanimity'', Swami Sivananda Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Another Sanskrit term for equanimity is ''[[Upeksha (Indian thought)|upekṣhā]]''. This is the term used by [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' (1.33),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Commentary on the Yoga Sutras|author=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|publisher=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-13339.htm#1.33|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''upekṣhā'' is considered to be one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]], along with [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] (''maitri''), [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''karuṇā''), and [[mudita|joy]] (''mudita''). It is related to the idea of [[Vairagya]] or "dispassion". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a [[yoga]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upekshayoga.com/yoga/Principles.html Upeksha yoga]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Yoga]] traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular [[meditation]], combined with regular practice of [[pranayama]], asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.

==Stoicism==
Equanimity is a central concept in [[Stoic ethics]] and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word ''[[apatheia]]'' or ''[[ataraxia]]'' whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word ''aequanimitas''. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father [[Antoninus Pius]]'s last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon "aequanimitas" (equanimity). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Pyrrhonism==
In [[Pyrrhonism]] the term used for equanimity is ''[[ataraxia]]'', which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. 

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], [[upekkha|equanimity]] (''[[upekkhā]]'', ''upekṣhā'') is one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]] and is considered:

{{quote|Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for [[wisdom]] and [[free will|freedom]] and the protector of [[compassion]] and [[love]]. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The [[Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will."|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Equanimity|author=[[Gil Fronsdal]]|publisher=Insight Meditation Center|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/equanimity.html|date=2004-05-29|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Equanimity can also be cultivated through meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahmana|first=Metteyya|date=2016-05-14|title=NEW EQUANIMITY MEDITATION AND TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE TO TEST ITS EFFECTIVENESS|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303111890_NEW_EQUANIMITY_MEDITATION_AND_TOOLS_FROM_PSYCHOLOGY_AND_NEUROSCIENCE_TO_TEST_ITS_EFFECTIVENESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development.  The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv|Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv]].

==Christianity==
[[Samuel Johnson]] defined equanimity as "evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed." In [[Christian philosophy]], equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the [[theological virtues]] of [[gentleness]], [[contentment]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twenty Essays on the Practical Improvement of God's Providential Dispensations as Means of Moral Discipline to the Christian|publisher=RB Seeley and W Burnside|page=51|year=1838|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lFwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Johnson&amp;dq=Equanimity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The word “[[Islam]]” is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''aslama'', which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a [[Muslim]] can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.

==Baha'i Faith==
The voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than "equanimity" in the Baha'i Writings are "detachment" and "selflessness" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: "Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is written about him: "So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: "Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} He wrote: "Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world." {{Citation needed|reason=Source must be directly cited and linked to as footnote|date=June 2018}}

In religion, a '''false prophet''' is one who falsely claims the gift of [[prophecy]] or [[Revelation|divine inspiration]], or who uses that gift for [[evil]] ends. Often, someone who is considered a "true [[prophet]]" by some people is simultaneously considered a "false prophet" by others, even within the same religion as the "prophet" in question. The term is sometimes applied outside religion to describe someone who fervently promotes a theory that the speaker thinks is false.

[[File:B Facundus 220v.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fate of The False Prophet'', [[Events of Revelation#Chapter 16|Revelation 16]], Beatus de Facundus, 1047]]

Throughout the [[New Testament]], there are warnings of both false prophets and [[false Messiah]]s, and believers are adjured to be vigilant. The following verses ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|7:15-20|RSV}}) are from the [[Sermon on the Mount]]:

:"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit. A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits."

The New Testament addresses the same point of a false prophet predicting correctly and Jesus predicted the future appearance of [[false Christ]]s and false prophets, affirming that they can perform great signs and miracles. The following verses are from the [[Olivet Discourse]]:

:"Take heed that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ''I am the Christ'', and they will lead many astray. [...] Then if any one says to you, ''Lo, here is the Christ!'' or ''There he is!'', do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. Lo, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ''Lo, he is in the wilderness'', do not go out; if they say, ''Lo, he is in the inner rooms'', do not believe it." (Matthew {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:4-5|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|24:23-26|RSV}})

In the [[Gospel of Luke]], Jesus brought out an ethical application for his disciples using the analogy of false prophets in the Old Testament:

:"Woe to you, when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets." ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:26|RSV}})

In the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] encountered a false prophet named [[Elymas|Elymas Bar-Jesus]] on the island of [[Cyprus]]:

:"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus. He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him and said, “You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord." ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:6-12|RSV}})

This particular story likewise best matches the model found in [[Deuteronomy]]. The claim here is that Elymas is trying to turn [[Sergius Paulus]] from the true faith, just like the false prophet described in the preceding verses. In these verses, we do not see Elymas prophesying as the term is popularly understood, so the model seems to fit this scenario best.

The [[Second Epistle of Peter]] makes a comparison between false teachers and false prophets and how the former will bring in false teachings, just like the false prophets of old:

:"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from of old their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep." ([[2 Peter]] {{Bibleverse-nb||2 Peter|2:1-3|RSV}})

The [[First Epistle of John]] warns those of the Christian faith to test every spirit because of these false prophets:

:"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already." ([[1 John]] {{Bibleverse-nb||1 John|4:1-3|RSV}})

===The false prophet of ''Revelation''===
One well-known New Testament false prophet is the false prophet mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. The Apocalypse's false prophet is the agent of the [[The beast (Revelation)#Beast from the sea|Beast]], the [[Antichrist]], and he is ultimately cast with the Beast into the [[Lake of Fire#Christianity|lake of "fire and brimstone"]] ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:20|RSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Revelation|20:10|RSV}}). Another mention of a false prophet in the New Testament is an [[Antichrist|antichrist spirit]] which denies the Son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunny|first=Ahmad|date=19 Apr 2011|title=Prophet Muhammad in French and English Literature: 1650 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rE0xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|location=|publisher=The Islamic Foundation|page=94|isbn=0860374785|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|editor-last=Tolan|editor-first=John Victor|date=15 September 2000|title=Medieval Christian Perceptions of Islam: A Book of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RAtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PG121|location=|publisher=Routledge|page=99|isbn=0415928923|author-link=John V.

==Islam==
{{See also|Islamic eschatology|List of Mahdi claimants|Prophets of Islam}}
The [[Quran]] portrays [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] as the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|Seal of the Prophets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|33|40|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is understood by mainstream [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] Muslims to mean that anyone who claims to be a new prophet after him is a [[False messiah|false prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|9|128|e=129|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; All mainstream Muslim scholars' perspectives from both Sunni and Shia denominations do not see the second coming of the [[Messiah]] as the coming of a new prophet, as the Islamic Messiah [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] had already been an existing prophet, and will rule by the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]] of [[Muhammad]], bringing no new revelation or prophecy.

Thawban ibn Kaidad narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"There will be 30 dajjals among my Ummah. Each one will claim that he is a prophet; but I am the last of the Prophets (Seal of the Prophets), and there will be no Prophet after me."|Related by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] as a sound hâdith.}}

[[Abu Hurairah]] narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|"The Hour will not be established until two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, until about 30 dajjals appear, and each of them will claim that he is Allah's Apostle..."|[[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Volume 9, Book 88: Afflictions and the End of the World, Hâdith Number 237.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|88|237}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Muhammad also stated that the last of these Dajjals would be the [[False Messiah]], [[Masih ad-Dajjal|al-Masih ad-Dajjal]] ([[Antichrist]]):

[[Samra ibn Jundab]] reported once Muhammad (while delivering a ceremonial speech at an occasion of a solar eclipse) said;
{{Quote|"Verily by Allah, the Last Hour will not come until 30 dajjals will appear and the final one will be the One-eyed False Messiah."|Related by [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmed]] and [[Al-Tabarani|Imam Tabarani]] as a sound hâdith.}}

[[Anas ibn Malik]] narrated that Muhammad said;
{{Quote|1="There is never a prophet who has not warned the Ummah of that one-eyed liar; behold he is one-eyed and your Lord is not one-eyed.&lt;ref name="muslim1"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dajjal is blind of one eye&lt;ref name="muslim2"&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his forehead are the letters [[K-F-R|k. f. r.]] ([[Kafir]])&lt;ref name="muslim1"/&gt; between the eyes of the Dajjal&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|41|7008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which every Muslim would be able to read."&lt;ref name="muslim2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=1704 |title=The Signs Before the Day of Judgment by Ibn Kathîr |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315191536/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=1704 |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|2=[[Sahih Muslim]], Book 41: The Book Pertaining to the Turmoil and Portents of the Last Hour, Chapter 7: The Turmoil Would Go Like The Mounting Waves of the Ocean, Ahâdith 7007-7009.}}

:"If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder, and if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place, and he says, 'Let us follow other gods' (gods you have not known) 'and let us worship them,' you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you" ([[Deuteronomy]] 13:1–5 [[New International Version|NIV]]).

The [[Books of Kings]] records a story where, under duress from [[Ahab]], the prophet [[Micaiah]] depicts God as requesting information from his heavenly counsel as to what he should do with a court of false prophets. This depiction is recorded in [[1 Kings]] 22:19–23:
: "Micaiah continued, 'Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.' And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'"
: "One suggested this, and another that. Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord and said, 'I will entice him.'"
: "'By what means?' the Lord asked."
: "'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said."
: "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the Lord. 'Go and do it.'"
: "So now the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The Lord has decreed disaster for you" ([[1 Kings]] 22:19–23 [[New International Version|NIV]]).

It is possible that Micaiah meant to depict the false prophets as a test from YHWH. It is also possible that it was meant as a slur on Ahab's prophets, such as Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah.&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Cogan, 1 Kings: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, Anchor Bible Commentaries, Yale 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty for false prophecy, including speaking in the name of a god other than YHWH or speaking presumptuously in YHWH's name, [[List of capital crimes in the bible|is capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deut|18:20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, if a prophet makes a [[prophecy]] in the name of YHWH that does not come to pass, that is another sign that he is not commissioned of YHWH and that the people need not fear the false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Deut|18:22|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Koine Greek]] term ''pseuoprophetes'' occurs in the [[Septuagint]] Jeremiah 6:13, 33:8,11 34:7, 36:1,8, Zechariah 13:2, Josephus' Antiquities 8-13-1,10-7-3, War of the Jews 6-5-2, and Philo Specific Laws 3:8. Classical pagan writers use the term ''pseudomantis''.

==Use outside religion==
The term ''false prophet'' is sometimes applied outside religion, to describe promoters of scientific, medical, or political theories which the author of the phrase thinks are false. [[Paul Offit]]'s 2008 book ''[[Autism's False Prophets]]'' applied the phrase to promoters of unproven theories and therapies such as the [[thiomersal controversy]] and [[chelation therapy]]. [[Ronald Bailey]]'s 1993 book ''Ecoscam: The False Prophets of Ecological Apocalypse'' applied the phrase to promoters of the [[global warming]] hypothesis; however, by 2005 Bailey had changed his mind, writing "Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Reason |author= Bailey R |title= We're all global warmers now |date=2005-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flying Spaghetti Monster''' ('''FSM''') is the deity of the '''Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''', or '''Pastafarianism'''. Pastafarianism (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[pasta]]'' and ''[[Rastafari|Rastafarianism]]'') is a [[social movement]] that promotes a light-hearted view of religion and opposes the teaching of [[intelligent design]] and [[creationism]] in public schools. According to adherents, Pastafarianism is a "real, legitimate religion, [[definition of religion|as much as any other]]".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/?page_id=2|title=About|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|work=The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, Pastafarian representatives are authorized to officiate weddings.&lt;ref name="NZcelebrant" &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11595894 |title= First Pastafarian celebrant can help couples get noodley knotted |first=Nicholas |last=Jones |authorlink= |website=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date= Feb 26, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZPirateWedding" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35112484|title=NZ approves Pastafarian marriages|date=December 16, 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36062126 |title=New Zealand stages first Pastafarian wedding on pirate boat |publisher=BBC |date=April 16, 2016 |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, a federal judge has ruled that the "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster" is not a real religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reisman|first1=Sam|title=Federal judge rules the Flying Spaghetti Monster is not a God|url=https://www.rt.com/usa/339519-judge-flying-spaghetti-god/|website=RT.com|publisher=RT Question More|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018 the [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Dutch Council of State]] also ruled that Pastafarianism is not a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/16/pastafarianism-is-not-a-religion-dutch-court-rules |title=Spaghetti injunction: Pastafarianism is not a religion, Dutch court rules |first=Jon |last=Henley |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=August 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Flying Spaghetti Monster" was first described in a satirical open letter written by [[Bobby Henderson (activist)|Bobby Henderson]] in 2005 to protest the [[Kansas evolution hearings|Kansas State Board of Education decision]] to permit teaching [[intelligent design]] as an [[Creation and evolution in public education|alternative to evolution in public school science classes]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; In the letter, Henderson demanded equal time in science classrooms for "Flying Spaghetti Monsterism", alongside intelligent design and evolution.&lt;ref name="openletter"&gt;{{cite web |author=Henderson, Bobby |year=2005 |title=Open Letter To Kansas School Board |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/ |publisher=Venganza.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407182624/http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/ |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Henderson published the letter on his website, the Flying Spaghetti Monster rapidly became an [[Internet meme|Internet phenomenon]] and a symbol of opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/arts/design/29mons.html?ex=1178251200 |title=But Is There Intelligent Spaghetti Out There?|accessdate=February 5, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]] Arts article|first=Sarah |last=Boxer |date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastafarian tenets (generally satires of creationism) are presented both on Henderson's ''Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'' website, where he is described as "prophet", and in ''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]'', written by Henderson in 2006. The central belief is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. [[Pirates]] are revered as the original Pastafarians.&lt;ref name="alarabiya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/07/13/157427.html |title=Austrian Pastafarian dons colander as religious headgear for drivers license |first= |last= |work=english.alarabiya.net |year=2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718004250/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/07/13/157427.html |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson asserts that a decline in the number of pirates over the years is the cause of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; The FSM community congregates at Henderson's website to share ideas about the Flying Spaghetti Monster and crafts representing images of it.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Because of its popularity and exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a contemporary version of [[Russell's teapot]]—an argument that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon those who make [[unfalsifiable]] claims, not on those who reject them. Pastafarianism has received praise from the scientific community and criticism from proponents of intelligent design. Pastafarians have engaged in disputes with creationists, including in [[Polk County, Florida]], where they played a role in dissuading the local school board from adopting new rules on teaching evolution.&lt;ref name="Polk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbo.com/news/education/polk-needled-noodled-in-evolution-flap-176172|title=Polk Needled, Noodled In Evolution Flap|author=Billy Townsend |date=March 27, 2013|publisher=The Tampa Tribune|accessdate=September 7, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson argued that his beliefs were just as valid as intelligent design, and called for equal time in science classrooms alongside intelligent design and evolution.&lt;ref name="openletter"/&gt; The letter was sent prior to the [[Kansas evolution hearings]] as an argument against the teaching of intelligent design in biology classes.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Henderson, describing himself as a "concerned citizen" representing more than ten million others, argued that intelligent design and his belief that "the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster" were equally valid.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; In his letter, he noted,
{{quote|I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country, and eventually the world; one third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence.|Bobby Henderson&lt;ref name="openletter"/&gt;}}
According to Henderson, since the intelligent design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm |title="Spaghetti Monster" is noodling around with faith |accessdate=February 5, 2007 |work=[[USA Today]] Science &amp; Space article |first1=Dan |last1=Vergano |date=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson explained, "I don't have a problem with religion. What I have a problem with is religion posing as science. If there is a god&lt;!-- note: Original source does use non-capitalized "god." I decided against using {{sic}} here because it is an arguable, albeit unlikely use (not a pronoun) that does not really affect clarity --&gt; and he's intelligent, then I would guess he has a sense of humor."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Escapist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_142/3048-In-His-Name-We-Pray-Ramen.5|title=In His Name We Pray, Ramen|last=Pitts|first=Russ|date=September 16, 2005|work=Escapist magazine|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, having received no reply from the Kansas State Board of Education, Henderson posted the letter on his website, gaining significant public interest.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="openletterabout"&gt;{{cite web |title=Discussion of the Open Letter |publisher=Henderson, Bobby |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/discussion/ |accessdate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Pastafarianism became an Internet phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Henderson published the responses he then received from board members.&lt;ref name="openletterrespond"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kansas School Board Responses to the Open Letter |publisher=Henderson, Bobby |url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/responses/ |date = June 25, 2005 |accessdate=January 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three board members, all of whom opposed the curriculum amendments, responded positively; a fourth board member responded with the comment "It is a serious offense to mock God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A18740559#back3|title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster|date=February 1, 2007|work=h2g2|publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson has also published the significant amount of hate mail, including death threats, that he has received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/31/fsm-hate-mail.html|title=FSM hate mail|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=July 31, 2006|work=BoingBoing|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/168629|title=In praise of an alternate creation theory: The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster gains infamy and faith|date=January 7, 2007|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=December 31, 2009 |first=Leslie |last=Scrivener}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one year of sending the open letter, Henderson received thousands of emails on the Flying Spaghetti Monster, eventually totaling over 60,000,&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; of which he has said that "about 95 percent have been supportive, while the other five percent have said I am going to hell".&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; During that time, his site garnered tens of millions of hits.&lt;ref name="Comment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter-discussion/|title=Comment on the Open Letter|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|date=August 2006|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As word of Henderson's challenge to the board spread, his website and cause received more attention and support. The satirical nature of Henderson's argument made the Flying Spaghetti Monster popular with bloggers as well as humor and Internet culture websites.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,371205,00.html |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=August 24, 2005 |accessdate=September 8, 2007 |quote=[FSM] has certainly caught the imagination of the online community [...] Henderson receives over 150 emails from supporters every day. |title=A Tangled Tale of a Pasta-based Prophet }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flying Spaghetti Monster was featured on websites such as [[Boing Boing]], [[Something Awful]], [[Uncyclopedia]], and [[Fark.com]]. Moreover, an International Society for Flying Spaghetti Monster Awareness and other fan sites emerged.&lt;ref name="Ha Ha, Only Serious" /&gt; As public awareness grew, the mainstream media picked up on the phenomenon. The Flying Spaghetti Monster became a symbol for the case against intelligent design in public education.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flying Spaghetti Monster |date=August 6, 2005 |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://www.newscientist.com/backpage.ns?id=mg18725112.800 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005083851/http://www.newscientist.com/backpage.ns?id=mg18725112.800 |archivedate=October 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Rothschild |title=Evolution debate creates monster |date=August 24, 2005 |work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/aug/24/evolution_debate_creates_monster/?education }}&lt;/ref&gt; The open letter was printed in several major newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; and received worldwide press attention.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; Henderson himself was surprised by its success, stating that he "wrote the letter for [his] own amusement as much as anything".&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

In August 2005, in response to a challenge from a reader, Boing Boing announced a $250,000 prize—later raised to $1,000,000—of "Intelligently Designed currency" payable to any individual who could produce empirical evidence proving that Jesus is not the son of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="prize"&gt;{{cite web |title=Boing Boing's $250,000 Intelligent Design challenge |publisher = BoingBoing.net |url=http://boingboing.net/2005/08/19/boing-boings-250000.html |date = August 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was modeled as a parody of a [[Kent Hovind#$250,000 offer|similar]] challenge issued by [[Young Earth creationism|young-earth]] creationist [[Kent Hovind]].&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind.html#appendix1 |title=Dr. Hovind's $250,000 Offer |author=Kent Hovind |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henderson, newspaper articles on the Flying Spaghetti Monster attracted the attention of book publishers; he said that at one point, there were six publishers interested in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Comment" /&gt; In November 2005, Henderson received an advance from Villard to write ''[[The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]]''.&lt;ref name="newyorkmag"&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Wolff |title=The Case For Intelligent Design: Spaghetti as the Creator |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=November 16, 2005 |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the Kansas State Board of Education voted to allow criticisms of evolution, including language about intelligent design, as part of testing standards.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kansas Education Board First to Back "Intelligent Design" |date=November 9, 2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/08/AR2005110801211.html |first=Peter |last=Slevin |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 2007, the board voted 6–4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. This was the fifth time in eight years that the board had rewritten the standards on evolution.&lt;ref name="msnbc2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kansas board boosts evolution education |date=February 14, 2007 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17132925/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets==
{{Quote box | quote = With millions, if not thousands,&lt;!-- It does in fact say "millions, if not thousands" --&gt; of devout worshipers, the Church of the FSM is widely considered a legitimate religion, even by its opponents—mostly fundamentalist Christians, who have accepted that our God has larger balls than theirs. | author = Bobby Henderson&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; |width  = 30% |align  = right }}

Although Henderson has stated that "the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma", some general beliefs are held by Pastafarians.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; Henderson proposed many Pastafarian tenets in reaction to common arguments by proponents of intelligent design.&lt;ref name="gelf"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Thierman |title=Touched by his Noodly Appendage |date=September 18, 2005 |publisher=Gelf Magazine |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/mt/archives/touched_by_his_noodly_appendage.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; These "[[canon (basic principle)|canonical]] beliefs" are presented by Henderson in his letter to the Kansas State Board of Education,&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', and on Henderson's web site, where he is described as a "prophet".&lt;ref name="flashguide" /&gt; They tend to satirize creationism.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

===Creation===
{{see also|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The central creation myth is that an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe "after drinking heavily". According to these beliefs, the Monster's intoxication was the cause for a flawed Earth. Furthermore, according to Pastafarianism, all evidence for evolution was planted by the Flying Spaghetti Monster in an effort to test the faith of Pastafarians—parodying certain [[Biblical literalism|biblical literalists]].&lt;ref name="GOLEM" /&gt; When scientific measurements such as radiocarbon dating are taken, the Flying Spaghetti Monster "is there changing the results with His Noodly Appendage".&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt;

===Afterlife===
The Pastafarian conception of [[Heaven]] includes a [[beer]] volcano and a [[stripper]] (or sometimes [[prostitute]]) factory.&lt;ref name="flashguide"&gt;{{cite web |author=DuBay, Tim |year=2005|title=Guide to Pastafarianism |format=Shockwave Flash|url=http://www.venganza.org/flash/guidetopastafarianismpreloaded.swf |accessdate=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pastafarian [[Hell]] is similar, except that the beer is stale and the strippers have [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref name="hell"&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pirates and global warming===
[[File:PiratesVsTemp(en).svg|thumb|left|A [[misleading graph]] that is claimed to correlate the number of pirates with global temperature|alt=chart showing that in 1820 there were 25,000 pirates and the global average temperature was 14.2 degrees C, while in 2000 there were 17 pirates and the global average temperature was 15.9 degrees C.]]
According to Pastafarian beliefs, pirates are "absolute divine beings" and the original Pastafarians.&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; Furthermore, Pastafarians believe that the concept of pirates as "thieves and outcasts" is misinformation spread by Christian theologians in the Middle Ages and by [[Hare Krishnas]]. Instead, Pastafarians believe that they were "peace-loving explorers and spreaders of good will" who distributed candy to small children, adding that modern pirates are in no way similar to "the fun-loving buccaneers from history". In addition, Pastafarians believe that ghost pirates are responsible for all of the mysteriously lost ships and planes of the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Pastafarians are among those who celebrate [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]] on September 19.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of pirates in Pastafarianism was part of Henderson's original letter to the Kansas State Board of Education, in an effort to illustrate that [[correlation does not imply causation]].&lt;ref name="Volcano"&gt;{{cite book|last=Savino|first=John |author2=Marie D. Jones|title=Supervolcano: The Catastrophic Event That Changed the Course of Human History: Could Yellowstone Be Next|publisher=Career Press|year=2007|page=56|chapter=Wrath of the Gods|isbn=978-1-56414-953-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSIa0VQn1NQC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=Flying+Spaghetti+Monster#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson presented the argument that "global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s".&lt;ref name="openletter" /&gt; A deliberately [[misleading graph]] accompanying the letter (with numbers humorously disordered on the ''x''-axis) shows that as the number of pirates decreased, global temperatures increased. This parodies the suggestion from some religious groups that the high numbers of disasters, famines, and wars in the world is due to the lack of respect and worship toward their deity. In 2008, Henderson interpreted the growing pirate activities at the [[Gulf of Aden]] as additional support, pointing out that [[Somalia]] has "the highest number of pirates ''and'' the lowest [[carbon emissions]] of any country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venganza.org/2008/04/14/somalia/ |title=Somalia&amp;nbsp;— Lots of pirates, low carbon emissions |accessdate=December 10, 2008 |work= |publisher=www.venganza.org |date=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flying Spaghetti Monster Tree Topper.jpg|thumb|An alternative [[tree-topper]] for Pastafarians, handmade from pipe cleaners and pom poms.]]
===Holidays===
Pastafarian beliefs extend into lighthearted religious ceremony. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; Prayers are concluded with a final declaration of affirmation, "R'amen" (or "rAmen"); the term is a parodic [[portmanteau]] of the terms "Amen" and "[[Ramen]]", referring to instant noodles and to the "noodly appendages" of their deity.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title = In the beginning there was the Flying Spaghetti Monster |date=September 11, 2005 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=December 19, 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1498162/In-the-beginning-there-was-the-Flying-Spaghetti-Monster.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of [[Christmas]], [[Hanukkah]], and [[Kwanzaa]], Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined holiday named "Holiday". Holiday does not take place on "a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season, itself". According to Henderson, as Pastafarians "reject dogma and formalism", there are no specific requirements for Holiday. Pastafarians celebrate Holiday in any manner they please.&lt;ref name="holiday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/2006/12/01/happy-holiday-season-everyone/|title= Happy Holiday Season Everyone|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|date=December 1, 2006|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastafarians also celebrate "Pastover" as a parody of [[Passover]],&lt;ref name="FSM Holidays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=203909|title=Questions on FSM Holidays|year=2008|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=14602|title=A question about Pastover|year=2010|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/4876/austrian_court_oks_head-colander_in_driver%E2%80%99s_license%3A_is_pastafarianism_becoming_a_religion|title=RD Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ramendan" as a parody of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name="Ramendan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=357996|title=Ramendan|year=2008|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.elpais.com%2Fel-comidista%2F2011%2F07%2Fpastafarismo-religion-ateismo.html|title=El Pais|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/117202/pastafarian-wins-the-right-to-wear-spaghetti-strainer-for-his-drivers-license-photo/|title=Death and Taxes magazine|work=Death and Taxes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastafarians interpret the increasing usage of "Happy Holidays", rather than more traditional [[greetings]] (such as "Merry Christmas"), as support for Pastafarianism.&lt;ref name="holiday" /&gt; In December 2005, [[George W. Bush]]'s White House Christmas greeting cards wished people a happy "holiday season",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/06/AR2005120601900.html|title='Holiday' Cards Ring Hollow for Some on Bushes' List|last=Cooperman|first=Alan|date=December 7, 2005|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading Henderson to write the President a note of thanks, including a "fish" emblem depicting the Flying Spaghetti Monster for his limousine or plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/fsm_card_for_bush.jpg|title=FSM Card for Bush|last=Henderson|first=Bobby|date=December 2006|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|accessdate=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson also thanked [[Walmart]] for its use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005 Bobby Henderson received a reported US$80,000 advance from [[Villard (imprint)|Villard]] to write ''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster''. Henderson said he planned to use proceeds from the book to build a pirate ship, with which he would spread the Pastafarian religion.&lt;ref name="newyorkmag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katleen |last=Craig |title=Passion of the Spaghetti Monster |date=December 22, 2005 |publisher=Wired News |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2005/12/69905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on March 28, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812976564|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|year=2009|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=October 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723054624/http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780812976564|archive-date=July 23, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborates on Pastafarian beliefs established in the open letter.&lt;ref name="Austin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A356663|title=The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|last=Brenner|first=Wayne|date=April 14, 2006|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |accessdate=October 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson employs satire to present perceived flaws with [[evolutionary biology]] and discusses history and lifestyle from a Pastafarian perspective. The gospel urges readers to try Pastafarianism for thirty days, saying, "If you don't like us, your old religion will most likely take you back".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson states on his website that more than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold.&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt;

''[[Scientific American]]'' described the gospel as "an elaborate spoof on Intelligent Design" and "very funny". In 2006, it was nominated for the [[Quill Award]] in Humor, but was not selected as the winner.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/worship/fsm-book/|title=The FSM Book |last=Henderson|first=Bobby|year=2006|work=Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=October 18, 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427153020/http://www.venganza.org/about/fsm-book/ |archivedate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne Allen Brenner of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' characterized the book as "a necessary bit of comic relief in the overly serious battle between science and superstition".&lt;ref name="Austin" /&gt; [[Simon Singh]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that the gospel "might be slightly repetitive...but overall it is a brilliant, provocative, witty and important gem of a book".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3655035/Was-the-world-created-by-god-evolution-or-pasta.html|title=Was the world created by god, evolution or pasta?|last=Singh|first=Simon|date=September 3, 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=November 28, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casey Luskin of the [[Discovery Institute]], which advocates intelligent design, labeled the gospel "a mockery of the Christian [[New Testament]]".&lt;ref name="Luskin FSM and Christmas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/12/celebrating_christmas_at_the_c.html|title="Celebrating" Christmas at the "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"|last=Luskin|first=Casey|date=December 25, 2006|work=Evolution News &amp; Views|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Loose Canon''===
In September 2005, before Henderson had received an advance to write the ''Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', a Pastafarian member of the Venganza forums known as Solipsy, announced the beginning of a project to collect texts from fellow Pastafarians to compile into the ''Loose Canon, the Holy Book of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster'', essentially analogous to the Bible.&lt;ref name="The Big Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venganza.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=1899|title=The Big Announcement|year=2005|publisher=Venganza.org|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was completed in 2010 and was made available for download.&lt;ref name="The Loose Canon"&gt;{{cite web

===As a cultural phenomenon===
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster now consists of thousands of followers,&lt;ref name="Volcano" /&gt; primarily concentrated on college campuses in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="Academics" /&gt; According to the Associated Press, Henderson's website has become "a kind of cyber-watercooler for opponents of intelligent design". On it, visitors track meetings of pirate-clad Pastafarians, sell trinkets and bumper stickers, and sample photographs that show "visions" of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,311925,00.html|title=Religious Scholars to Discuss 'Flying Spaghetti Monster'|date=November 16, 2007|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the Swedish concept designer Niklas Jansson created an adaptation of Michelangelo's ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', superimposing the Flying Spaghetti Monster over God.

===Use in religious disputes===
Owing to its popularity and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is often used as a modern version of [[Russell's teapot]].&lt;ref name="Teapot"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Church of the Non-Believers |first=Gary |last=Wolf |date=November 14, 2006 |publisher=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Faith the Enemy of Science?|last=MacKenzie|first=Richard|year=2007|volume=64|issue=103|journal=Physics in Canada|arxiv=0807.3670|bibcode=2008arXiv0807.3670M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that, since the existence of the invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be [[falsified]], it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. [[Richard Dawkins]] explains, "The onus is on somebody who says, I want to believe in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not up to us to disprove it."&lt;ref name="Teapot" /&gt; Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of ''The Journal of Religion and Theater'', the Flying Spaghetti Monster is "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt; A similar argument was discussed in the books ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and ''The Atheist Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God delusion|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2006|page=53|chapter=The God Hypothesis|isbn=978-0-618-68000-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 24, 2009|quote=I have found it an amusing strategy, when asked whether I am an atheist, to point out that the questioner is also an atheist when considering Zeus, Apollo, Amon Ra, Mithras, Baal, Thor, Wotan, the Golden Calf and the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

In December 2007 the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was credited with spearheading successful efforts in [[Polk County, Florida]], to dissuade the [[Polk County School Board]] from adopting new science standards on evolution. The issue was raised after five of the seven board members declared a personal belief in intelligent design. Opponents describing themselves as Pastafarians e-mailed members of the Polk County School Board demanding equal instruction time for the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Chambliss |title= Satirical Monsters More Competition for Darwin|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20071211/NEWS/712110392/0/FRONTPAGE |publisher=The Ledger |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Board member Margaret Lofton, who supported intelligent design, dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting, stating, "they've made us the laughing stock of the world". Lofton later stated that she had no interest in engaging with the Pastafarians or anyone else seeking to discredit intelligent design. As the controversy developed, scientists expressed opposition to intelligent design. In response to hopes for a new "applied science" campus at the [[University of South Florida]] in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], university vice president Marshall Goodman expressed surprise, stating, "&lt;nowiki&gt;[intelligent design is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not science. You can't even call it pseudo-science." While unhappy with the outcome, Lofton chose not to resign over the issue. She and the other board members expressed a desire to return to the day-to-day work of running the school district.&lt;ref name="Polk" /&gt;

==Legal status==
National branches of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster have been striving in many countries to have FSMism become an officially (legally) recognized religion, with varying degrees of success. In [[New Zealand]], Pastafarian representatives have been authorized as marriage celebrants, however members of other movements considered to be "alternative philosophies" rather than religions are also recognized as celebrants under New Zealand law.&lt;ref name="NZcelebrant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NZPirateWedding" /&gt;

A federal court in the US state of Nebraska ruled that Flying Spaghetti Monster is a satirical [[parody religion]], rather than an actual religion, and as a result, Pastafarians are not entitled to religious accommodation under the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is not a question of theology", the ruling reads in part. "The FSM Gospel is plainly a work of satire, meant to entertain while making a pointed political statement. To read it as religious doctrine would be little different from grounding a 'religious exercise' on any other work of fiction."&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh &gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/308299698/Cavanaugh-v-Bartelt|title=Cavanaugh v Bartelt|date=April 12, 2016|website=United States District Court for the District of Nebraska|access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pastafarians have used their claimed faith as a [[Test case (law)|test case]] to argue for [[freedom of religion]], and to oppose government discrimination against people who do not follow a recognized religion.

===Marriage===
The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster operates an [[ordination mill]] on their website which enables officiates in jurisdictions where credentials are needed to officiate weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Kimberly |url=http://www.kptv.com/story/23633416/online-ministerial-ordnation-available |title=You, too, can become a minister - online - KPTV - FOX 12 |publisher=KPTV |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastafarians say that [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] precludes the government from arbitrarily labelling one denomination religiously valid but another an ordination mill. In November 2014, Rodney Michael Rogers and [[Minneapolis]]-based Atheists for Human Rights sued [[Washington County, Minnesota]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] equal protection clause and the [[First Amendment]] free speech clause, with their attorney claiming [[discrimination against atheists]]: "When the statute clearly permits recognition of a marriage celebrant whose religious credentials consist of nothing more than a $20 'ordination' obtained from the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster... the requirement is absolutely meaningless in terms of ensuring the qualifications of a marriage celebrant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/east/280267352.html|title=Atheists sue Washington County over denial to perform marriages|publisher=Star-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days prior to a hearing on the matter, Washington County changed its policy to allow Rogers his ability to officiate weddings. This action was done in an effort to deny the court jurisdiction on the underlying claim. On May 13, 2015 the Federal Court held that the issue had become [[Mootness|moot]] and dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Atheists for Human Rights v.

===Free speech===
In March 2007, Bryan Killian, a high school student in [[Buncombe County, North Carolina]], was suspended for wearing "pirate regalia" which he said was part of his Pastafarian faith. Killian protested the suspension, saying it violated his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights to religious freedom and freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770328123|title=School: Pirates are not welcome|last=Schrader|first=Jordan|date=March 29, 2007|work=Citizen-Times|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If this is what I believe in, no matter how stupid it might sound, I should be able to express myself however I want to", he said.&lt;ref name="Escapist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/43272-student-punished-for-spaghetti-beliefs|title=Student punished for spaghetti beliefs|date=March 29, 2007|work=Metro|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tracy McPherson of the Pennsylvanian Pastafarians petitioned the Chester County, Pennsylvania Commissioners to allow representation of the FSM at the county courthouse, equally with a Jewish [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] and a Christian [[nativity scene|nativity]] scene. One commissioner stated that either all religions should be allowed or no religion should be represented, but without support from the other commissioners the motion was rejected. Another commissioner stated that this petition garnered more attention than any he had seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvanian Pastafarians fight for Holiday Display|url=http://www.venganza.org/2012/11/pennsylvanianholida|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pasta-loving 'church' tests Pa. holiday display |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pasta-loving-church-tests-Pa-holiday-display-4073601.php |publisher=SF Gate |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202011544/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pasta-loving-church-tests-Pa-holiday-display-4073601.php |archivedate=December 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2012, Pastafarian Giorgos Loizos was arrested in [[Greece]] on charges of malicious [[blasphemy]] and offense of religion for the creation of a satirical [[Facebook]] page called "[[Elder Pastitsios]]", based on a well-known deceased [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monk, [[Elder Paisios of Mount Athos|Elder Paisios]], where his name and face were substituted with [[pastitsio]] – a local pasta and [[béchamel sauce]] dish. The case, which started as a Facebook flame, reached the [[Greek Parliament]] and created a strong political reaction to the arrest.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite web

In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won the legal right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a [[Colander|pasta strainer]] on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive.

==Critical reception==
With regard to Bobby Henderson's 2005 open letter, according to Justin Pope of the ''[[Associated Press]]'': {{quote|Between the lines, the point of the letter was this: there's no more scientific basis for intelligent design than there is for the idea an omniscient creature made of pasta created the universe. If intelligent design supporters could demand equal time in a science class, why not anyone else? The only reasonable solution is to put nothing into sciences classes but the best available science.|Justin Pope&lt;ref name="Academics" /&gt;|}}
[[File:Dog Tag Atheist FSM.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army ID tag ([[dog tag]]) listing "Atheist/FSM" as the religious/belief system preference|alt=two metal US Army dog tags with Atheist/FSM stamped on them.]]
Justin Pope praised the Flying Spaghetti Monster as "a clever and effective argument".&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt; [[Simon Singh]] of the ''Daily Telegraph'' described the Flying Spaghetti Monster as "a masterstroke, which underlined the absurdity of Intelligent Design", and applauded Henderson for "galvanis[ing] a defence of science and rationality".&lt;ref name="Telegraph2" /&gt; Sarah Boxer of the ''New York Times'' said that Henderson "has wit on his side".&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; In addition, the Flying Spaghetti Monster was mentioned in an article footnote of the ''[[Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review]]'' as an example of evolution "enter[ing] the fray in popular culture", which the author deemed necessary for evolution to prevail over intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Brendan|year=2006|title=Kitzmiller v.

Casey Luskin of the [[Discovery Institute]], which promotes intelligent design, contested this, saying, "the problem for their logic is that ID is not an arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature."&lt;ref name="Luskin South Park"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/08/the_proper_rebuttal_to_the_fly.html|title=The Proper Rebuttal to the Flying Spaghetti Monster: Cartoon Satire on South Park|last=Luskin|first=Casey|date=August 13, 2008|work=Evolution News &amp; Views|publisher=Discovery Institute|accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Jeff Jacoby (columnist)|Jeff Jacoby]] wrote in ''The Boston Globe'' that intelligent design "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti.

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

The '''Four Freedoms Award''' is an annual award presented to those men and women whose achievements have demonstrated a commitment to those principles which [[United States|US]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] proclaimed in his [[Four Freedoms|historic speech]] to [[United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, as essential to democracy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear. The annual award is handed out in alternate years in [[New York City]] by the [[Roosevelt Institute]] to [[Americans]] and in [[Middelburg]], [[Netherlands]], by the [[Roosevelt Stichting]] to non-Americans.

==History==

|title=State of the Union (Four Freedoms) (January 6, 1941)
|filename=FDR's 1941 State of the Union (Four Freedoms speech) Edit 1.ogg
|description =[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union Address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]] (starting at 32:02)
|image=[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|alt=Franklin Delano Roosevelt headshot|100px|thumb|[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]]]
}}
The awards were first presented in 1982 on the centennial of President Roosevelt's birth as well as the bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the United States and the [[Netherlands]]. The awards were founded to celebrate the Four Freedoms espoused by President Roosevelt in his speech:
#[[Freedom of speech]]
#[[Freedom of worship]]
#[[Freedom from want]]
#[[Freedom from fear]]

For each of the four freedoms an award was instituted, as well as a special Freedom medal. In 1990, 1995, 2003 and 2004 there were also special awards.

In odd years the awards are presented to American citizens or institutions by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in New York City, though in the past the American awards were given in Hyde Park, New York. In even years the award ceremony is held in Middelburg and honours non-Americans. The choice of Middelburg was motivated by the suspected descendance of the family Roosevelt from [[Oud-Vossemeer]] in the municipality [[Tholen (municipality)|Tholen]].

{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=all}}

'''Freedom of religion''' is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or [[belief]] in teaching, practice, [[worship]], and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=5 December 2006|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201105738/http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|archivedate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ANDmIIpAmwC&amp;pg=PA29734|title=Congressional Record #29734 – 19 November 2003|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with a [[state religion]], freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not [[religious persecution|persecute]] believers in other faiths.
Freedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.

[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Minerva]] as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]
Historically, ''freedom of religion'' has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while ''freedom of worship'' has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom ''from'' religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of [[dhimmi]]s, literally "protected individuals" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

[[Cyrus the Great]] established the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html Cyrus Cylinder], [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A.

Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, [[Zoroastrianism]], Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the [[trial of Socrates]] in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token [[sacrifice]] was similar to refusing to take an [[oath of allegiance]]. This was the core for resentment and the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christian communities]].

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Greek-Jewish clashes at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in 73 AD and 117 AD and in [[Alexandria]] in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

The Romans tolerated most religions, including [[Judaism]] and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate [[Christianity]] until it was legalised by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]] in 311. The [[Edict of Milan]] guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===Muslim world===
Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of [[Medina]] (then known as ''Yathrib''), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] was declared by [[Muhammad]] in the [[Constitution of Medina]]. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept ''[[dhimmi]]'' status and their adult males pay the punitive ''[[jizya]]'' tax instead of the ''[[zakat]]'' paid by Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Njeuma|first=Martin Z.|title=Fulani Hegemony in Yola (Old Adamawa) 1809-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQA4Q6fX7EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=8pyCFSKL0V&amp;dq=Fulani%20Hegemony%20in%20Yola%20(Old%20Adamawa)%201809-1902&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-726-95-0|page=82|quote=Of all the various forms of taxation known to Islamic communities, it seems only two{{snd}} the zakat and the jixya were of importance in Adamawa.

Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French scholar Gustave Le Bon (the author of ''La civilisation des Arabes'') writes "that despite the fact that the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim was free to enjoy equally well with every Muslim all the privileges afforded to the citizens of the state. The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged by a non-Muslim."

[[Religious pluralism]] existed in classical [[Islamic ethics]] and [[Sharia]], as the [[religious law]]s and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=C.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order.&lt;ref name="al-Qattan-99"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0020743800055501|first=Najwa|last=al-Qattan|title=Dhimmis in the Muslim Court: Legal Autonomy and Religious Discrimination|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=31|issue=3|pages=429–44|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=1999|issn=0020-7438|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

===India===
{{Main article|Freedom of religion in India}}
Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Who are the Jews of India? – The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. University of California Press. 2000. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21323-4}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWX6pF2PTJwC&amp;pg=PA26.; "When the Portuguese arrived in 1498, they brought a spirit of intolerance utterly alien to India. They soon established an Office of Inquisition at Goa, and at their hands Indian Jews experienced the only instance of anti-Semitism ever to occur in Indian soil."&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion [[edicts]] have been found written during [[Ashoka the Great]]'s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Although India is an 80% [[Hindu]] country, India is a secular state without any [[state religion]]s.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, [[Hinduism]], has long been a most tolerant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E.

The [[Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the [[Mahabharata]], has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. "Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition," the Dalai Lama said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/42229/indias-religious-tolerance-lauded.html|title=India's religious tolerance lauded|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) ([[Ashoka]]). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a [[Edicts of Ashoka|just and humane society]]. Later he promoted the principles of [[Buddhism]], and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:
{{Quote|King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.}} 

On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/christian_persecution_in_india.htm|title=Christian Persecution in India: The Real Story|publisher=Stephen-knapp.com|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |format=PDF |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] counters this argument by saying that [[evangelical]] Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.

In September 2010, the Indian state of [[Kerala]]'s State Election Commissioner announced that "Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers".&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orthodoxherald.com/2010/09/18/%E2%80%98using-places-of-worship-for-campaigning-in-kerala-civic-polls-is-violation-of-poll-code%E2%80%99/|title='Using places of worship for campaigning in Kerala civic polls is violation of poll code'|newspaper=Indian Orthodox Herald|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"/&gt;

Even today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. [[Hindu]] festivals like [[Deepavali]] and [[Holi]], Muslim festivals like [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid-Ul-Adha]], [[Muharram]], Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like [[Buddha Purnima]], [[Mahavir Jayanti]], Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all [[Indian people|Indians]].

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====
[[File:CONGRESS COLUMN-BRUSSELS-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (13).jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century allegorical statue on the [[Congress Column]] in Belgium depicting religious freedom]]
Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews]] from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the [[Inquisition]] for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As early as 1380, [[John Wycliffe]] in England denied [[transubstantiation]] and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a [[Papal Bull]] in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemia]]n preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the [[Council of Constance]]. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of [[Granada]], Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the [[Treaty of Granada]], but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The [[Morisco]]s (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]].

[[Martin Luther]] published his famous 95 Theses in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:

* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God's grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of [[indulgence]]s and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the [[Diet of Worms]] before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the [[Wartburg]] in the possessions of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], where he translated the [[New Testament]] into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. [[Huldrych Zwingli]] preached reform in [[Zürich]] from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England]] was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and [[Thomas More]], who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the [[Bern]]ese imposed the reformation on the canton of [[Vaud]] by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in [[Lausanne]] and destroyed all its art and statuary. [[John Calvin]], who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

[[File:ReligiousFreedomStamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A U.S. postage stamp commemorating religious freedom and the [[Flushing Remonstrance]] ]]
The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when [[Mary I of England]] returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England]] was to restore the [[Church of England]] in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The [[King James Bible]] commissioned by King [[James I of England]] and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the [[Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day]] on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the "Michelade" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and [[Utraquism|Utraquists]]. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the meantime, in Germany [[Philip Melanchthon]] drafted the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France]]. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The [[French Revolution]] then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's [[Edict of Torda]] declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited.

The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda.

{{Quotation|Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience:
''His majesty, our Lord, in what manner he{{snd}} together with his realm{{snd}} legislated in the matter of religion at the previous Diets, in the same matter now, in this Diet, reaffirms that in every place the preachers shall preach and explain the Gospel each according to his understanding of it, and if the congregation like it, well. If not, no one shall compel them for their souls would not be satisfied, but they shall be permitted to keep a preacher whose teaching they approve. Therefore none of the superintendents or others shall abuse the preachers, no one shall be reviled for his religion by anyone, according to the previous statutes, and it is not permitted that anyone should threaten anyone else by imprisonment or by removal from his post for his teaching.

Four religions ([[Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarianism]]) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxs]], [[Sabbatarians]] and [[Anabaptists]] were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mult-kor.hu/20051125_erdely_es_a_habsburg_vallaspolitika_a_17_szazad_utolso_evtizedeiben "Kovács Kálmán: Erdély és a Habsburg valláspolitika a 17. század utolsó évtizedeiben"] ''Mult-Kor'' (25 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

This religious freedom ended however for some of the religions of Transylvania in 1638. After this year the [[Szekler Sabbatarians|Sabbatarians]] begun to be persecuted, and forced to convert to one of the accepted religions of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/192.html|title=History of Transylvania.

=====Habsburg rule in Transylvania=====
Also the Unitarians (despite of being one of the "accepted religions") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/290.html|title=History of Transylvania.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Union of Utrecht]] (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciffs, N.J., p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. [[William Penn]], the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Poland====
[[File:Konfederacja Warszawska.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573. The beginning of religious freedom in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
The General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the [[Statute of Kalisz]] was issued by the Duke of [[Greater Poland]] [[Bolesław the Pious|Boleslaus the Pious]] on 8 September 1264 in [[Kalisz]]. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir III of Poland]] in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453 and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinkoff|first=Nancy|title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-KmeZgY2hIC|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-930675-16-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f–KmeZgY2hIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=1539 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{Main article|Warsaw Confederation}}
The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski, Adam. ''The Polish Way''.

===United States===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in the United States}}
Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] found it necessary to found a new colony in [[Rhode Island]] to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were the most active of the New England persecutors of [[Quakers]], and the persecuting spirit was shared by [[Plymouth Colony]] and the colonies along the [[Connecticut river]].&lt;ref name=PER/&gt; In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]], who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.&lt;ref name=PER&gt;Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.&lt;ref name="Symbol of Enduring Freedom"&gt;Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years later (1649), the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: "No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof." The Act allowed freedom of worship for all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians in Maryland, but [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] anyone who denied the divinity of [[Jesus]]. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J.

Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1682){{snd}} founded by Protestants Roger Williams, [[Thomas Hooker]], and William Penn, respectively{{snd}} combined the democratic form of government which had been developed by the Puritans and the Separatist [[Congregationalists]] in Massachusetts with religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Fennell (1998), ''Plymouth Colony Legal Structure'' (http://www.histarch.uiuc.edu/plymouth/ccflaw.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanover Historical Texts Project (http://history.hanover.edu/texts/masslib.html)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the [[Holy Spirit]], it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict [[separation of church and state]] has to be kept.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte der Christenheit'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 943&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded the disestablishment of state churches{{snd}} [[Anglican]] and [[Congregationalist]]{{snd}} and the protection of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], written in 1779 by [[Thomas Jefferson]], proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those sentiments also found expression in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the national constitution, part of the United States' [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] established the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

===Canada===
{{Further information|Freedom of religion in Canada}}
Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide [[reasonable accommodation]] to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a [[Sikh]] [[turban]], when there is a ''[[bona fide]]'' occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a [[hard hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-60-e.htm#a6 Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere. 2.2.2 Headcoverings].

===International===
On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]]. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/36/a36r055.htm|title=A/RES/36/55.

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states in its Article 14: ''"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{snd}} States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.{{snd}} Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr2int.htm Religious Rights – International Legal Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fb22.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal secular===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued in favour of freedom of religion.|alt=A man posing for a print]]
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] noted in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'', that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country.  That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this [[free competition]] amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 643–49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hindus]] believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal. One of the famous Hindu sayings about religion is: "Truth is one; sages call it by different names."&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained at Western Wall for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]
[[Judaism]] includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]]. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as  peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Erica|last2=Galperin|first2=Misha|title=The Case for Jewish Peoplehood: Can We be One?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-401-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC&amp;pg=PA71 71]|quote=The 'hood' is not only a geographic reference; it is a shared identity that may be characterized by joint assumptions, body language, certain expressions, and a host of familial-like behaviors that unite an otherwise dispirate groupe of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not [[ Israeli apartheid| equal ]] with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.

Possibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.

The State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current{{clarify timeframe|date=January 2017}} government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem.  Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having "high" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Global restrictions on Religion (2009" http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], have been arrested at the [[Western Wall]] for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. [[Women of the Wall]] have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-arrest-5-women-at-Western-Wall-for-wearing-tallitot-309436 "Police arrest 5 women at Western Wall for wearing tallitot"] ''Jerusalem Post'' (11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the [[Knesset]] synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: "paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel." MK [[Dov Lipman]] expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view "an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Maltz | first=Judy | title=Non-Orthodox Jews prohibited from praying in Knesset synagogue | date=26 November 2014 | newspaper=Haaretz | url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.628571 | accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.

===Christianity===
[[File:Worship-monument.jpg|left|thumb|Part of the [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar Straus]] Memorial in Washington, D.C. honoring the right to worship]] According to the Catholic Church in the [[Vatican II]] document on religious freedom, ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', "the human person has a right to religious freedom", which is described as "immunity from coercion in civil society".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |title=Declaration on religious freedom – ''Dignitatis humanae'' |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211202206/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of religious freedom "leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition, this right "is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Prior to this, [[Pope Pius IX]] had written a document called the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]. ''The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: "[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true" (15); "[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship"; "[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=The Syllabus|author=[[Pope Pius IX]]|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}, [http://www.ewtn.com/ Global Catholic Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|main line]] churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also affirms religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may"'', [http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng the eleventh Article of Faith].&lt;/ref&gt;

However others, such as African scholar [[Makau Mutua]], have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, "Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions."&lt;ref&gt;Mutua, Makau. 2004.

In their book ''[[Breaking India]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] and [[Aravindan Neelakandan]] discussed the "US Church" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to "save" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise{{snd}} a "network" of organizations, individuals, and churches{{snd}} that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India. They suggest that this nexus of players includes not only church groups, government bodies, and related organizations, but also private think tanks and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingindia.com/introduction/|title=Introduction|work=Breaking India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel Spring]] has written about the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the ''Imperium romanum''. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be "civilized" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, "just as the ''civitas''; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human{{snd}} to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature{{snd}} one had now also to be Christian." After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis|author=Joel H.

[[Conversion to Islam]] is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert  from Islam to another religion. Certain [[Muslim-majority countries]] are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries{{who|date=February 2012}} having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United States |first=Department of State|title=2010 International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/index.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012|reason=this may be supportable, but I don't see clear support in the source cited}} 

Islamic theologians{{Who|date=October 2009}} quote the [[Qur'an]] ({{Cite quran|2|256|expand=no|q=There is no compulsion in religion}} and {{Cite quran|109|1|end=6|expand=no|q=Say: O you who reject faith, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship...To you be your religion, and to me be mine}}, i.e., Sura [[Al-Kafirun]]) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.

{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, "Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good." In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; "The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.{{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims.

===Changing religion===
{{Main article|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls "proselytizing universalist faiths" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|format=PDF|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy in Islam====
{{Main article|Apostasy in Islam|Takfir|Mutaween}}
[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Legal opinion on apostasy by the [[Fatwa]] committee at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], the highest Islamic institution in the world, concerning the case of a man who converted to Christianity: "Since he left Islam, he will be invited to express his regret. If he does not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law."]]
In Islam, apostasy is called "''ridda''" ("turning back") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a "''murtad fitri''" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a "''murtad milli''" (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }} from "Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out" by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd" /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A.

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: "Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not."&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266.

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education. The court ruled in favor of Schempp and the Pennsylvania law was overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/abington-school-district-v-schempp|title=Abington School District V Schempp - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's rights==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2017}}
The law in Germany provides the term of "religious majority" (''Religiöse Mündigkeit'') with a minimum age for [[Minor (law)|minors]] to follow their own religious beliefs even if their parents don't share those or don't approve. Children 14 and older have the unrestricted right to enter or exit any religious community. Children 12 and older cannot be compelled to change to a different belief. Children 10 and older have to be heard before their parents change their religious upbringing to a different belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/kerzg/BJNR009390921.html|title=Gesetz über die religiöse Kindererziehung|publisher=Bundesrecht.juris.de|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar laws in Austria&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familienrecht.at/fileadmin/gesetze/abgb/rekerz.pdf Bundesgesetz 1985 über die religiöse Kindererziehung] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze.ch/sr/210/210_025.htm|title=Schweizerisches Zivilgesetzbuch Art 303: Religiöse Erziehung|publisher=Gesetze.ch|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Religious Freedom Day==
27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]], a group of [[Quakers]] executed by the [[Puritans]] on [[Boston Common]] for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] between 1659–1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margery Post Abbott|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7088-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-9.html Religious Freedom Day, 2006 – A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/library/hot_releases/January_16_2001_6.html Religious Freedom Day, 2001 – Proclamation by the President of the United States of America 15 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concerns==
In its 2011 annual report, the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]]'' designated fourteen nations as "countries of particular concern". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were [[Rohingya people|Burma]], China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=10154|title=US commission names 14 worst violators of religious freedom|accessdate=11 July 2011|publisher=Christianity Today|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;^ {{Cite press release|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3595|title=USCIRF Identifies World's Worst Religious Freedom Violators: Egypt Cited for First Time|publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;

There are concerns about the restrictions on public religious dress in some European countries (including the [[Hijab]], [[Kippah]], and [[Christian cross]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/france.passes.religious.symbol.ban/17.htm|title=France Passes Religious Symbol Ban|accessdate=29 April 2011|publisher=Christianity Today|date=9 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5414098.stm|title=The Islamic veil across Europe

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="prc-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2" /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the "very high" category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of Sri Lanka states under Chapter II, Article 9, "The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_02_Amd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221202/http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_02_Amd.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 10 and 14(1)(e) provide all citizens the freedom to adopt, practice and teach any religion of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/new-constitution-state-religion-buddhism/&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently in 1978, Buddhism was declared as the [[State religion]] by President [[J. R. Jayawardene]]. This preferential treatment to Buddhism is therefore highly controversial in Sri Lanka,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/new-constitution-state-religion-buddhism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/Foremost-place-for-Buddhism-in-new-Constitution-says-Ranil/article16069387.ece&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen as the prime factor in the rise of [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil separatism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Matters related to family law, e.g., divorce, child custody and inheritance are adjudicated under customary law of the applicable ethnic or religious group.  For example, the minimum age of marriage for women is 18 years, except in the case of Muslims, who continued to follow their customary religious practices of girls attaining marrying age with the onset of puberty and men when they are financially capable of supporting a family.&lt;ref name="StateDpt2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2011religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department International Religious Freedom Report 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, local police and government officials appeared to be acting in concert with Buddhist nationalist organizations. In addition, in 2013 NGOs allege that government officials provided assistance, or at least tacitly supported the actions of societal groups targeting religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2013religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department Religious Freedom Report 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the government established a special religious police unit to deal with religious complaints. The new unit reports to the Ministry of Law and Order, although it is housed in the Buddhist Division of the Ministry of Buddhist Sasana and Religious Affairs. Critics argue that it will bolster and strengthen the violent Buddhist groups.eg:-BBS (srilankan buddhist terror group) &lt;ref name="StateDpt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department International Religious Freedom Report 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no existing legislation which restricts the right of individuals to proselytize members of one faith to convert them to another religion. Foreign clergy may work in the country, but for the last three decades, the government has limited the issuance of temporary work permits. Work permits for foreign clergy are issued for one year (rather than five years as in the past). It is possible to obtain extensions of work permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=http://www.religlaw.org/index.php?blurbId=22271&amp;table=Blurb|website=ReligLaw – International Center for Law and Religious Studies,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coexistence has been recently marred by isolated incidents and attacks on religious places by Buddhist terrorists [[wiktionary:mob|mobs]] and by LTTE. Similarly Sri Lankan air force particularly has air raided Hindu, Christian shrines during the peak of war thinking that LTTE is taking shelter in there. 

Several Hindu temples were attacked in the riots of 1983 in [[Colombo]] and South of Sri Lanka.

Two of the holiest sites for Buddhists in Sri Lanka, the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree and the [[Temple of the Tooth]], have been attacked and bombed by the [[LTTE]]. In recent times, the LTTE have also attacked several Muslim [[mosques]] in the North-Eastern parts of the country. 

[[Navaly church bombing]] is one instance where the bombing of a church was blamed on the Sri Lankan air force, although there was no adequate evidence to clearly establish whether the Sri Lankan air force or the LTTE terrorists were responsible for this bombing incident.

'''Freedom of religion in [[Sri Lanka]]''' is however claimed to have been historically upheld through [[Freedom of religion|religious tolerance]] {{citation needed|reason=Sri Lanka is a home to ethnic religious riots. Provide citation to prove it|date=April 2016}}. The practice of [[Hinduism]] was allowed under [[Sinhala people|Sinhala]] kings since the Anuradhapura era. [[Buddhist]] Sinhala kings gave protection to [[Muslims]] fleeing from Portuguese persecution and to [[Catholics]] fleeing from persecution by the Dutch after having been defeated by the Portuguese.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Great Big God''' is a Children's Christian music series from [[Vineyard Records UK]].

== History ==
In 2000, [[Nigel Hemming (Musician and Songwriter)|Nigel Hemming]] was approached by [[Vineyard Records UK]] to co-produce the first [[Vineyard Churches UK and Ireland|Vineyard UK]] children’s worship album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song entitled 'Great Big God', written by Nigel and Jo Hemming,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://songselect.ccli.com/Songs/3373437/great-big-god|title=SongSelect by CCLI|website=songselect.ccli.com|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recorded and became the title track of the first album to be released under the brand ('''Great Big God''' – released in September 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following Easter, the song was chosen for use in the all age worship slot at [[Spring Harvest]], a national worship and teaching event in UK, and was featured on the live recording, ''Spring Harvest - Kids Praise 2002''.

Since the launch of the album in 2001 Great Big God as a series has grown and to date six albums, a DVD and three-disc best of compilation CD have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vineyardrecords.co.uk/web/profiles/great-big-god/|title=Great Big God - Vineyard Records UK|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the series has been noted by many Christian music reviewers. For example, in February 2006 [[Cross Rhythms]] said that the "''Great Big God'' CDs have been amongst the most popular British-made children's worship albums of recent years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Great_Big_God/Backing_Tracks/13706/|title=Review: Backing Tracks - Great Big God {{!}} Cross Rhythms|website=www.crossrhythms.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Cross Rhythms again reiterated the popularity of the series saying "Great Big God CDs and DVDs...have been hugely popular with both parents and kids".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Great_Big_God/Great_Big_God_Live/77983/|title=Review: Great Big God Live - Great Big God - DVD {{!}} Cross Rhythms|website=www.crossrhythms.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hierophany''' is a manifestation of the [[sacred]]. The word is a formation of the Greek adjective ''hieros'' ({{lang-gr|ἱερός}}; sacred/holy) and the verb ''phainein'' (φαίνειν; to reveal / to bring to light).

When the sacred is revealed in some form or other to an entity, it brings with it great pleasure and suffering, as one who has become familiar with the [[Divinity|Godhead]] would ascribe. This information can be then used by the recipient to assist others on their own path.

==In Mircea Eliade's writings==
The word ''hierophany'' recurs frequently in the works of the religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]], which he preferred to the more constrictive word ''[[theophany]]'' (an appearance of a god).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that religion is based on a sharp distinction between the sacred (God, gods, mythical ancestors, etc.) and the profane.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, for traditional man, myths describe "breakthroughs of the sacred (or the 'supernatural') into the World"—that is, hierophanies.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the hierophanies recorded in myth, the sacred appears in the form of ideal models (the actions and commandments of gods, heroes, etc.). By manifesting itself as an ideal model, the sacred gives the world value, direction, and purpose: "The manifestation of the sacred, ontologically founds the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, all things need to imitate or conform to the sacred models established by hierophanies, in order to have true reality: to traditional man, things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Comos and History'', pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''His Holiness''' is a style and form of address (in the variant form '''Your Holiness''') for some supreme religious leaders. The title is  most notably used by the [[Pope]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[Patriarch]]s, and [[Dalai Lama]].

== Christianity ==
''His Holiness'' ({{lang-lat|Sanctitas}}) is the official [[style (manner of address)|style]] used to address the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Pope]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[ Patriarch]]s. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] of Constantinople has the title of ''His All-Holiness'' (abbreviation HAH).

In February 2013, the [[Holy See]] announced that former [[Pope Benedict XVI]] would retain the style "His Holiness" after resigning and becoming [[Pope Benedict XVI#Pope Emeritus|Pope Emeritus]].
 
The term is sometimes abbreviated to "HH" or "H.H." when confusion with "His/Her Highness" is unlikely. The associated [[form of address]] is "Your Holiness".

Later, it is also used for certain other Eastern Patriarchs, notably those who head a church or rite which recognizes neither Rome's nor Constantinople's primacy.

== Other religions ==
The English language honorific "His Holiness", and as female version "Her Holiness", has commonly been used for [[religious leader]]s from other traditions, including [[Buddhism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/dalai-lama/default.aspx Royal Albert Hall ticket office: His Holiness the Dalai Lama, 19 June 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715035111/http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/dalai-lama/default.aspx |date=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (for figures such as the [[Dalai Lama]], the [[Karmapa]], and the [[Je Khenpo]] in [[Bhutan]]), [[Shinto]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2012/07/02/visit-most-venerable-revudugama-sri-buddharakkitha-thero-japan Asian Tribune: example of reference to "Her Holiness Shinso Ito, the Head Priest of Shinnyo en Temple in Tachikawa, Tokyo", 3 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ahmadiyya]] Islam for the [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] and in [[Dawoodi Bohra]] sect of [[Ismaili]] Shia for esteemed office of [[Da'i Al-Mutlaq]], [[Syedna]].
 
It is also used in certain new [[religious]] movements such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] of [[Hinduism]].

{{Refimprove|date = July 2013}}

'''Impiety''' is a perceived lack of proper respect for something considered sacred.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/impiety&lt;/ref&gt; Impiety is often closely associated with [[sacrilege]], though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a [[Cult (religion)|cult]], as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to [[Christianity]] was that, unlike other [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than religious. It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods. 
==Historical relevance==

The issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Filonik|first = Jakub|date = 2013|title = Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal|url = http://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/Dike/article/view/4290|journal = Dike|language = en|volume = 16|pages = 11–96|doi = 10.13130/1128-8221/4290|issn = 1128-8221}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Athenian men, including [[Alcibiades]], were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution ([[Andocides]] was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events). Most famously, the philosopher [[Socrates]] was executed for impiety (as well as corrupting Athenian youth) in 399 BC. An Athenian philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] taught that the sun and the stars were fiery stones whose heat we did not feel because of their distance, and was allegedly accused of impiety in Athens. [[Diagoras of Melos]] was reportedly accused of atheism and had to flee Athens after being charged with impiety for revealing the content of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] to the uninitiated. Philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] might have been accused of impiety as well.

[[File:Wodden Carvings of the Bululs.jpg|thumb|Wooden images of the ancestors (''[[Bulul]]'') in a museum in [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Mountain Province]], [[Philippines]]]]
Various terms have been used to refer to the '''religious beliefs of the 175 ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines''', where each had their own form of indigenous government prior to colonization from Islam and Spain. They are characterized as being [[Animism|animistic]], and have been collectively referred to as '''Anitism''' or '''Bathalism''' or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric '''Dayawism'''.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

The profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs.   While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a "''common structural framework of ideas''" which can be studied together.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

Some writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the [[Shinto]] religion of [[Japan]], although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez2017"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mYEoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=anito+Philippines+shinto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXCig7dTQ9&amp;sig=1HJUBcwvyTpVNsBipF2PStnEh-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-sLWXt9TXAhWBuZQKHam4BhQQ6AEIggEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=anito%2520Philippines%2520shinto&amp;f=false |title=Mixed Magic: Global-local Dialogues in Fairy Tales for Young Readers |last=Gutierrez |first=Anna Katrina |date=2017-06-15 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027265456 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | coauthors =  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where [[Islam]], [[Catholicism]], or [[Protestantism]] have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Philippines]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called "[[Folk Catholicism]]"&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt; and "[[Folk Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called [[Philippine mythology]], and is an important aspect of the study of [[Philippine culture]] and [[Filipino psychology]].

== Religious worldview ==
{{Main|Anito}}
[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|15th century ''[[bulul]]'', an ''[[anito]]'' representation, with a ''pamahan'' (ceremonial bowl) in the [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Historian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world.  Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (''[[anito]]'') everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

''Anito'' were the [[ancestor spirit]]s (''umalagad''), or nature spirits and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. ''Paganito'' (also ''maganito'' or ''anitohan'') refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan''). ''Anito'' can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''paganito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") has been further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]", and thus ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (''taotao'') of ancestral and nature spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as [[anitism]] in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K. Hislop|year=1971|title=Anitism: a survey of religious beliefs native to the Philippines |journal=Asian Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144&amp;ndash;156|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deities and spirits ==
{{Main|Deities of Philippine mythology}}

=== Creator gods in Filipino religions ===
Many indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;  Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as [[Bathala]], who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or  Lumikha (the creator).  Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as [[Laon]], meaning "the ancient one."  Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama.  Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as [[Kabuniyan]].&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;

In most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach.&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;  People thus tended to pay more attention to "lesser gods" or "assistant deities" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;

=== "Lower gods" in Filipino religions===
Lesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes.  These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;

==Filipino folk healers==
{{Unreferenced section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'', functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were for folk healers.  At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

''Albularyos'' employ herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the ''albularyo'' became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the ''albularyos'' to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the role of the ''albularyo'' was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the ''albularyos'' with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, ''albularyos'' flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

===Rituals===
Some of the rituals observed by Filipino Folk Healers include:
*''Pangalap'' - the aforementioned yearly search for concoction ingredients
*''Halad'' - ritual offering of food and drink to honor the spirits of the dead
*''Palínà'' - ritual fumigation; called ''tu-ob'' in the islands of [[Panay]] and [[Negros Island|Negros]]
*''Pangadlip'' - the chopping or slicing of ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*''Pagpagong'' - burning or reducing the ingredients into charcoal or ashes
*Making of ''Minasa'' - concoctions made from the ''pangalap'' ingredients 
*Rubbing with ''Lana'' - medicinal oil concocted from [[coconut]]

'''The International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief (IPPFoRB)''' is a network of parliamentarians from around the world committed to combating religious persecution and advancing freedom of religion or belief, as defined by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com|title=The IPPFoRB's website|last=|first=|date=|website=ippforb.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IPPFoRB was established on 8 November 2014 with the signing of the Oslo Charter for Freedom of Religion or Belief at the [[Nobel Peace Center]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/30-parliamentarians-meet-oslo-sign-freedom-religion-charter|title=30 Parliamentarians Meet with USCIRF in Oslo to Sign a Freedom of Religion Charter|last=|first=|date=2014-11-13|work=World Religion News|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steering committee of the IPPFoRB was composed of Baroness [[Elizabeth Berridge, Baroness Berridge|Elizabeth Berridge]] (UK [[House of Lords]]), [[David Anderson (Saskatchewan politician)|David Anderson]] ([[House of Commons of Canada]]), [[Abid Raja]] ([[Parliament of Norway]]), [[Aykan Erdemir]] ([[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]]), Leonardo Quintao ([[National Congress of Brazil]]).

== Activities ==

In September 2015, IPPFoRB convened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organized' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=2015-09-22|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 parliamentarians from 50 countries in [[New York City|New York]], alongside the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and issued the New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief to "enhance global cooperation by working across geographical, political, and religious lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com/new-york-resolution/|title=New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=IPPFoRB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the New York meeting, IPPFoRB founder Aykan Erdemir stated that this global network is "idea for which the time is right," adding that people advocating rights should be as "outspoken, organised and transnational" as the violent extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organised' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2015|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=December 15, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, IPPFoRB assembled 100 parliamentarians from 60 countries in [[Berlin]] with the attendance of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2016/09/freedom-of-religion-or-belief-the-defining-issue-of-our-time/|title=Freedom of religion or belief 'the defining issue of our time'|last=|first=|date=|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, IPPFoRB parliamentarians have written advocacy letters to heads of state of Burma, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/religious-rights/305900-legislators-abroad-unite-for-religious-freedom|title=Legislators abroad unite for religious freedom|last=|first=|date=2016-11-14|work=The Hill|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPPFoRB steering committee members have received awards in recognition of their efforts: Aykan Erdemir was awarded the [[Stefanus Prize]] by the [[Stefanus Alliance International]] in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/nyheter/norge/2016/Stefanusprisen+2016.b7C_wlLQ2N.ips|title=Stefanusprisen 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=The Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baroness Elizabeth Berridge is the recipient of the 2017 International Religious Liberty Award of the [[International Center for Law and Religion Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iclrs.org/index.php?pageId=1&amp;contentId=1&amp;blurbId=86128|title=Baroness Elizabeth Berridge Receives 2017 International Religious Liberty Award|last=|first=|date=|website=International Center for Law and Religion Studies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abid Raja]] was named the 2018 recipient of the [[International Religious Liberty Association]]'s International Award for Outstanding Leadership in Religious Freedom Advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irla.org/norwegian-parliamentarian|title=Norwegian Parliamentarian to be Recognized for Global Efforts to Promote Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=The International Religious Liberty Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Harwood Hick''' (20 January 1922 – 9 February 2012) was a [[Philosophy of religion|philosopher of religion]] and [[Theology|theologian]] born in England who taught in the United States for the larger part of his career. In [[philosophical theology]], he made contributions in the areas of [[theodicy]], [[eschatology]], and [[Christology]], and in the philosophy of religion he contributed to the areas of [[epistemology]] of religion and [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref name=peters&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Peters |first=Richard |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Man of Many Mysticisms }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
John Hick was born on 20 January 1922 to a middle-class family in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], England. In his teens, he developed an interest in philosophy and religion, being encouraged by his uncle, who was an author and teacher at the [[University of Manchester]]. Hick initially pursued a [[law degree]] at the [[University of Hull]], but, having converted to [[Evangelical Christianity]], he decided to change his career and he enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1941.

During his studies, he became liable for [[military service]] in [[World War II]], but, as a [[conscientious objector]] on moral grounds, he enrolled in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].

After the war, he returned to Edinburgh and became attracted to the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and began to question his fundamentalism. In 1948 he completed his MA thesis, which formed the basis of his book ''Faith and Knowledge''.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; He went on to complete a [[D. Phil]] at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[Oxford University]] in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/hick-john.aspx|title=John Hick Centre for Philosophy of Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[DLitt]] from Edinburgh in 1975.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]''. Ed. Walter A. Elwell. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2001.) 552.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Theology  at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he married Joan Hazel Bowers, and the couple had four children. After many years as a member of the [[United Reformed Church]], in October 2009 he was accepted into membership of the [[Quakers|Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)]] in Britain. He died in 2012.&lt;ref name="University of Birmingham"&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/hick-john.aspx]: ''University of Birmingham'' website.

==Career==
Hick's academic positions included Danforth Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the [[Claremont Graduate University]], California (where he taught from 1979 to 1992); H.G. Wood Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]]; and Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Research in Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theology.bham.ac.uk/emeritistaff/hick.htm |title=University of Birmingham |accessdate=25 February 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While at the University of Birmingham Hick played important roles in a number of organizations centered on community relations.  Non-Christian communities, mostly Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, had begun to form in this central England community as immigration from the Caribbean Islands and Indian subcontinent increased. Due to the influx of peoples with different religious traditions, organizations focused on integrating the community became necessary. During his fifteen years at the University of Birmingham, Hick became a founder, as well as the first chair, for the group All Faiths for One Race (AFFOR); he served as a chair on the Religious and Cultural Panel, which was a division of the Birmingham Community Relations Committee; and he also chaired the coordinating committee for a 1944 conference convened under the new Education Act with the aim of creating a new syllabus for religious instruction in city schools.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also held teaching positions at [[Cornell University]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 Gifford Lecture Series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032902/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 |date=16 February 2008 }} – Biography – John Hick&lt;/ref&gt; During his teaching stay at Princeton Seminary, Hick began to depart from his conservative religious standings as he began to question "whether belief in the Incarnation required one to believe in the literal historicity of the Virgin Birth".&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.  "A Pluralist View."  "More Than One Way? Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World".  Eds. Dennis L. Okholm and Timothy R. Phillips.  Grand Rapids, MI:  Zondervan Publishing House, 1995. 27–59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This questioning would open the door for further examination of his own Christology, which would contribute to Hick's understanding of religious pluralism. He was the Vice-President of [[the British Society for the Philosophy of Religion]], and Vice-President of The World Congress of Faiths.&lt;ref name="giffordlectures"&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 Full name, year of birth and other biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032902/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=219 |date=16 February 2008 }}: ''Gifford Lecture Series'' website. Retrieved on 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick delivered the 1986–87 [[Gifford lectures]]&lt;ref name="giffordlectures" /&gt; and in 1991 was awarded the prestigious [[Grawemeyer Award]] from the [[University of Louisville]] and the [[Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary]] for Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Authors/Author.htm?ContributorID=HickJ&amp;QueryStringSite |title=Zondervan |accessdate=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick was twice the subject of [[heresy]] proceedings. In 1961 or 1962, he was asked whether he took exception to anything in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith|Westminster Confession of 1647]] and answered that several points were open to question. Because of this, some of the local ministers appealed against his reception into the presbytery. Their appeal was sustained by the Synod. A year later, a counter-appeal was sustained by the Judicial Committee of the General Assembly, and Hick became a member of the presbytery.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Hick's philosophy==
Robert Smid states that Hick is regularly cited as "one of the most – if not simply the most – significant philosopher of religion in the twentieth century".&lt;ref name=smid/&gt; [[Keith Ward]] once described him as "the greatest living philosopher of global religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhick.org.uk/ Keith Ward], Regius Professor of Divinity, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his advocacy of [[religious pluralism]],&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; which is radically different from the traditional Christian teachings that he held when he was younger.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt; Perhaps because of his heavy involvement with the inter-faith groups and his interaction with people of non-Christian faiths through those groups, Hick began to move toward a pluralistic outlook. He notes in both ''More Than One Way?'' and ''God and the Universe of Faiths'' that, as he came to know these people who belonged to non-Christian faiths, he saw in them the same values and moral actions that he recognized in fellow Christians.  This observation led him to begin questioning how a completely loving God could possibly sentence non-Christians who clearly espouse values that are revered in Christianity to an eternity in hell.  Hick then began to attempt to uncover the means by which all those devoted to a theistic religion might receive salvation.

Hick has notably been criticized by then-Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], later Pope between 2005 and 2013, when he was head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]. Ratzinger had examined the works of several theologians accused of [[relativism]], such as [[Jacques Dupuis (priest)|Jacques Dupuis]] and [[Roger Haight]], and found that many, if not all, were philosophically inspired by Hick. Therefore, the declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' was seen by many at the time as a condemnation of Hick's ideas and theories.

===Kantian influences===
Having begun his career as an evangelical, he moved towards pluralism as a way of reconciling God’s love with the facts of cultural and religious diversity. He was primarily influenced by Immanuel Kant in this regard, who argued that human minds obscure actual reality in favor of comprehension (see [[Immanuel Kant#Theory of perception|Kant's theory of perception]]). According to Richard Peters, for Hick, "[the] construal of the relationship of the human mind to God...is much like the relationship that Kant supposed exists between the human mind and the world".&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;

It isn't fair to say that Hick is strictly Kantian, however. Peters notes "the divide between the '[[noumenal]]' and '[[phenomenal]]' realms (so far as nature is concerned) is not nearly so severe for Hick as it was for Kant".&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Hick also declares that the [[God|Divine Being]] is what he calls 'transcategorial'. We can experience God through categories, but God Himself obscures them by his very nature.

===Pluralism===
In light of his Kantian influences, Hick claims that knowledge of the Real (his generic term for Transcendent Reality) can only be known as it is being perceived. For that reason, absolute truth claims about God (to use Christian language) are really truth claims about perceptions of God; that is, claims about the phenomenal God and not the noumenal God. Furthermore, because all knowledge is rooted in experience, which is then perceived and interpreted into human categories of conception, cultural and historical contexts which inevitably influence human perception are necessarily components of knowledge of the Real. This means that knowledge of God and religious truth claims pertaining thereof are culturally and historically influenced; and for that reason should not be considered absolute. This is a significant aspect of Hick's argument against Christian [[exclusivism]], which holds that although other religions might contain partial goodness and truth, [[salvation]] is provided only in Jesus Christ, and the complete truth of God is contained only in Christianity.

Perhaps the simplest manner in which to understand Hick's theory of pluralism of religions is to share the comparison he makes between his own understanding of religion and the Copernican view of our solar system.  Before [[Copernicus]] disseminated his views of the solar-centered universe, the [[Geocentric model#Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic system]] ruled in which the stars were painted in the sky, and the sun rose and set around the earth.  In short, the rest of the universe existed for and was centered on earth.  On the other hand, Copernicus asserted that the earth, and other planets as well, circled the sun, which in fact, did not move, but only appeared to move due to the revolution of our planet.  Copernicus introduced our world to the understanding that other planets took similar paths around the sun; while each path differed, all served the same purpose and generated the same result:  every planet makes a full path around our central star. Rotation of a planet about its axis creates day and night for that planet, just as day and night occur on earth.  Although the time frames for a full trip around the sun and for a full day-night cycle differs on a planet-by-planet basis, the concept remains constant throughout our solar system.

Similarly, Hick draws the metaphor that the Ptolemaic view of religion would be that Christianity is the only way to true salvation and knowledge of the one true God. Ptolemaic Christianity would assert that everything exists and all of history has played out in specific patterns for the glory of the Christian God, and that there is no other possible path that will lead to salvation.  Hick appears as Copernicus, offering the belief that perhaps all theistic religions are focused toward the one true God and simply take different paths to achieve the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John.  ''God and the Universe of Faiths''.  Oxford:  OneWorld Publications Ltd., 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

A speaker on religious pluralism, Keith E. Johnson, compares Hick's pluralistic theology to a [[Blind men and an elephant|tale of three blind men attempting to describe an elephant]], one touching the leg, the second touching the trunk, the third feeling the elephant's side.  Each man describes the elephant differently, and, although each is accurate, each is also convinced of their own correctness and the mistakenness of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Keith E. [http://wri.leaderu.com/theology/hick.html "John Hick's Pluralistic Hypothesis and the Problem of Conflicting Truth-Claims"]. Retrieved 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Smid states that Hick believes that the tenets of Christianity are "no longer feasible in the present age, and must be effectively 'lowered'".&lt;ref name=smid&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smid |first=Robert |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Harwood Hick |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_875_hick.htm#John%20Harwood%20Hick |accessdate= February 2008  |edition= |date= |year=1998–1999 |month= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Mark Mann notes that Hick argues that there have been people throughout history "who have been exemplars of the Real".&lt;ref name=mann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Mann |first=Mark |encyclopedia=Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology |title=John Hick: Mann's Quick Notes |url=http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_875_hick.htm#John%20Hick:%20Mann's%20Quick%20Notes |accessdate= February 2008  |year=1996–1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Here the author uses "Real" in the sense of how Hick defined it: "the referent of the world['s] religion." See Smid, reference 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick's position is "not an exclusively Christian inclusivism [like that of Karl Rahner and his ‘Anonymous Christian’], but a plurality of mutually inclusive inclusivism." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''A Christian Theology of Religion'' (KY: Westminster John Knox press, 1995), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick contends that the diverse religious expressions (religions) are the result of diverse historically and culturally influenced responses to diverse perceptions of the Real. He states that "the different religious traditions, with their complex internal differentiations, have developed to meet the needs of the range of mentalities expressed in the different human cultures." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''God Has Many Names'' (PA: Westminster Press, 1980), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many rebuttals to Hick's pluralism &lt;ref&gt;Keith Ward, "Truth and the Diversity of Religions." Philip L. Quinn and Kevin Meeker, eds. The Philosophical Challenge of Religious Pluralism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hick's Christology===
In his ''God and the Universe of Faiths'' (1973), Hick attempts to pinpoint the essence of Christianity.  He first cites the [[Sermon on the Mount]] as being the basic Christian teaching, as it provides a practical way of living out the Christian faith.  He says that "Christian essence is not to be found in beliefs about God...but in living as the disciples who in his name feed the hungry, heal the sick and create justice in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Hick, John. ''God and the Universe of Faiths''. Oxford:  Oneworld Publications Ltd., 1973, pp.109–110&lt;/ref&gt; However, all of the teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount, that form what Hick calls the essence of Christianity, flow directly from Jesus' ministry.  In turn, this means that the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus form the permanent basis of the Christian tradition.  Hick continues in this work to examine the manner in which the deification of Jesus took place in corporate Christianity following his crucifixion and questions whether or not Jesus actually thought of himself as the [[Messiah]] and the literal Son of God.

In several places (e.g. his contributions to ''The Metaphor of God Incarnate'', and his book ''[[The Myth of God Incarnate]]'') Hick proposes a reinterpretation of traditional Christology—particularly the doctrine of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. Hick contends "that the historical Jesus of Nazareth did not teach or apparently believe that he was God, or God the Son, Second Person of a Holy Trinity, incarnate, or the son of God in a unique sense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article16.html Believable Christianity]: A lecture in the annual October series on Radical Christian Faith at Carrs Lane United Reformed Church, Birmingham, 5 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It is for that reason, and perhaps for the sake of religious pluralism and peace, Hick proposes a metaphorical approach to incarnation. That is, Jesus (for example) was not literally God in the flesh (incarnate), but was metaphorically speaking, the presence of God. "Jesus was so open to divine inspiration, so responsive to the divine spirit, so obedient to God's will, that God was able to act on earth in and through him. This, I (Hick) believe, is the true Christian doctrine of the incarnation." &lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "A Pluralist View" in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'' eds. Dennis Ockholm and Timothy Phillips (MI: Zondervan, 1995), p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; Hick believes that a metaphorical view of the incarnation avoids the need for faulty Christian paradoxes such as the duality of Christ (fully God and fully human) and even the [[Trinity]] (God is simultaneously one and three).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither the intense christological debates of the centuries leading up to the Council of Chalcedon, nor the renewed christological debates of the 19th and 20th Centuries, have succeeded in squaring the circle by making intelligible the claim that one who was genuinely and unambiguously a man was also genuinely and unambiguously God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/gre3.htm "The Myth of God Incarnate"] from N. F. Gier, ''God, Reason, and the Evangelicals'' (University Press of America, 1987), chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Problem of evil==
Hick has identified with a branch of theodicy that he calls "[[Irenaean theodicy]]" or the "Soul-Making Defense".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Davis, ed. ''Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy'' (KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2001), 38–72.&lt;/ref&gt; A simplification of this view states that suffering exists as a means of spiritual development. In other words, God allows suffering so that human souls might grow or develop towards maturation. For Hick, God is ultimately responsible for pain and suffering, but such things are not truly bad. Perhaps with a greater degree of perception, one can see that the "evil" we experience through suffering is not ultimately evil but good, as such is used to "make our souls" better.

Therefore, Hick sees the evils of pain and suffering as serving God’s good purpose of bringing "imperfect and immature" humanity to itself  "in uncompelled faith and love."&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "D. Z. Phillips on God and Evil," ''Religious Studies '', Vol. 43, No. 2, posted on www.johnhick.org.uk/article18.html  (accessed 3 September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the after-life, Hick asserts that "God will eventually succeed in His purpose of winning all men to Himself."&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', Palgrave Macmillan, (2nd edition), 1977, p.342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of evil in Hick has been challenged by a number of theologians and moral philosophers including [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]] and [[John K. Roth]]. Using Hick's own words, Roth has stated, "Hick's theodicy is implausible to me because I am convinced that his claims about God's goodness cannot stand the onslaught of what he calls the principal threat to his own perspective: 'the sheer amount and intensity of both moral and natural evil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Roth, John. ''Encountering Evil'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Encountering Evil'', Stephen Davis has stated his four criticisms of Hick, "First, while no theodicy is free of difficulties, I believe Hick's is not entirely convincing in its handling of the amount of evil that exists in the world... Second, I am dubious about Hick's hope of a gradual spiritual evolution till human beings reach a full state of God-consciousness... Third, I believe Hick also faces what I call the 'cost-effective' criticism of the free will defense... My final and most serious criticism of Hick concerns his commitment to universalism."&lt;ref&gt;''Encountering Evil'', p. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3166">'''The Joshua Project''' (formerly part of '''AD2000''') is an organization seeking to highlight the ethnic groups of the world with the least followers of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]]. The Joshua Project maintains [[Ethnic group|ethnologic]] data to support [[Christian missions]] and is based in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], United States. The project began in 1995 within the former [[AD2000]] and Beyond Movement. From 2001 through 2005 the Joshua Project was at different times informally connected with Caleb Project, ICTA and World Help. In 2006, the Joshua Project officially became part of the [[U.S. Center for World Mission]], now called the [[Venture Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frontierventures.org/ministries/joshua-project frontierventures.org, Joshua Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Focusing on [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], the project maintains a database of "[[Unreached people group|unreached peoples]]" listed by country and language. As of 2010, they list 9,803 ethnic groups. These are further divided into 16,350 peoples-by-countries, counting national minorities individually for each of 236 countries, of which 6,642 are classified as "unreached peoples". Ethnic groups are organized hierarchically in 251 "People Clusters" which in turn are divided in 16 "Affinity Blocs" ([[Arab World]], [[East Asians]], [[Eurasia]]ns, [[Cushitic|Horn of Africa-Cushitic]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian-Median]], [[Jews]], [[Latin America#Ethnic groups|Latin-Caribbean Americans]], [[Malay peoples]], [[Demographics of North America|North American peoples]], [[Pacific Islanders]], [[South Asians]], [[Southeast Asians]], [[Sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Ethnic groups in Asia#Central Asia|Tibetan / Himalayan peoples]], [[Turkic peoples]] and Unclassified). Each ethnicity is listed as speaking at least one of 6,510 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/great-commission-statistics.php |title=Great Commission Statistics |publisher=Joshua Project |date= |accessdate=2010-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplegroups.org/Documents/26-6-joshua-project.pdf peoplegroups.org, Joshua Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/joshua-project Mission Frontiers Joshua Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of religious slurs''' in the English language that are, or have been, used as insinuations or allegations about adherents of a given [[religion]] or to refer to them in a derogatory (critical or disrespectful), [[pejorative]] (disapproving or contemptuous), or insulting manner.

==Christians==
; Bible beater: a [[dysphemism]] for Christian fundamentalists; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, US|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199888771|page=286|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=FwmQpyibKkAC&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a slang term for an evangelizing Christian fundamentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eble|first1=Connie|title=Slang &amp; sociability in-group language among college students|date=1996|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-1469610573|page=157|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=0mSJYH9KC-UC&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[wikt:Bible thumper|Bible thumper]] (also "[[wikt:Bible basher|Bible basher]]"; mainly US): Someone perceived as aggressively imposing their [[Christian beliefs]] upon others. The term derives from preachers thumping their hands down on the [[Bible]], or thumping the Bible itself, to emphasize a point during a [[sermon]]. The term's target domain is broad and can often extend to anyone engaged in a public show of religion, fundamentalist or not. The term is most commonly used in English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Robert E.|title=Ronald Reagan's Presidency: The Impact of an Alcoholic Parent|journal=Political Psychology|date=1 October 2008 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=737–765 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00662.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Cafeteria Christianity|Cafeteria Christian]]: a derogatory term used by some [[Christianity|Christians]], and others, to accuse other Christian individuals or [[Christian denominations|denominations]] of selecting which [[Christian doctrine]]s they will follow, and which they will not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The archbishop warned that “based on a relativistic understanding of the Christian faith and a conditional adherence to the Church, some Catholics seek to construct a Christianity and, consequently, a Church to their own liking, unilateral and outside the identity and mission that Jesus Christ has fundamentally given us.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Fundie]]: (US) Shortening of [[fundamentalist]]. Usually used to mean a Christian fundamentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n35_7HAYRWEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Language of Defamation Cases | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=[[Roger Shuy|Shuy, Roger W.]] | year=2009 | pages=81| isbn=9780199742318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestants===
; Bible basher: (UK, Australia, New Zealand) a Protestant, particularly one from a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] denomination, who believes in the fundamentalist authority of the Bible; also commonly used universally against Christians who are perceived to go out of their way to force their faith upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|title=The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203962114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UIjVGcSe8MC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22bible+thumper%22+etymology#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bible%20thumper%22%20etymology&amp;f=false|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Holy Roller]]: (US) an enthusiastic Protestant prone to rolling on the floor, suffering from fits or "speaking in tongues" ([[Pentecostal]]s during worship or prayer). The term ''holy roller'', however, is applied to some Evangelical Protestants, especially charismatics, if they are vocal about their own religious views or critical of individuals who do not meet their moral standards. Similar to Bible thumper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50208190?query_type=word&amp;queryword=roller "roller, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;", definition 17b,]{{dead link|date=July 2016}} ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' (account required for online access).

; [[Shakers|Shaker]]: (US) a member of the [[United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing]]. Originated as "Shaking Quakers", in reference to their similarity to Quakers as well as their charismatic worship practices, which involved dancing, shouting, and [[speaking in tongues]].

A '''military chaplain''' ministers to [[military personnel]] and, in most cases, their families and [[civilians]] working for the [[military]]. In some cases they will also work with local civilians within a military area of operations.

Although the term ''[[chaplain]]'' originally had [[Christian]] roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh H. |last=Morgan |url=http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |title=The Etymology of the Word Chaplain |work=International Pentecostal Holiness Church |accessdate=9 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905050247/http://chaplains.iphc.org/stories/etymology.html |archivedate=5 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally used today in military organizations to describe all professionals specially trained to serve any spiritual need, regardless of religious affiliation. In addition to offering [[pastoral care]] to individuals, and supporting their religious rights and needs, military chaplains may also advise the executive on issues of religion, and [[ethics]], [[morale]] and [[morals]] as affected by religion.  They may also [[wikt:liaison|liaise]] with local religious leaders in an effort to understand the role of religion as a factor both in hostility and war and in reconciliation and peace.&lt;ref name=TakingFaith&gt;{{cite web | first=Jane | last=Lampman | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1999/0304/p15s1.html | title=Taking faith to the 'new' front lines | quote=In all the hot spots – yet rarely mentioned – military chaplains are some of today's unsung heroes. | work=The [[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=4 March 1999 |accessdate=9 September 2010}} On the role of chaplains in multinational operations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military chaplains normally represent a religion or faith group but work with military personnel of all faiths and none. Some countries, like the Netherlands and Belgium,&lt;ref name="www2.canada.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/world/story.html?id=6a433205-7093-448b-b61e-d5be32aa3cb4 |title=Spiritual guidance without all that religion |publisher=.canada.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714113118/http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/world/story.html?id=6a433205-7093-448b-b61e-d5be32aa3cb4 |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also employ ''[[Secular humanism|humanist]]'' chaplains who offer a non-religious approach to chaplain support.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains, but their authority comes from their sending church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/chaplains/whoweare/endorsingauthorities.cfm |title=RAF Chaplains - Endorsing Authorities |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course, including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain.

In the United States, the term, ''nomination'', is not generally applied to the process of becoming a military chaplain. Individuals volunteer, and if they are accepted, they are ''commissioned'' as military staff officers in the Chaplain Corps. Members of the clergy who meet the qualifications for service as an officer in the military are free to apply for service with any of the three United States Chaplain Corps: the Army, Navy, and Air Force each has a Chaplain Corps, with Navy chaplains also assigned to serve with Marine Corps units, Coast Guard units, and the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]]. Some clergy, like rabbis, can apply without permission from any individual or organization within their faith group; others, in faith groups that have a hierarchy established to make decisions on the postings or positions of their members, must be granted permission from the appropriate official, such as the appropriate Bishop. As the application process proceeds, and the military determines whether the applicant will meet standards in areas such as health, physical fitness, age, education, citizenship, past criminal history, and ''suitability'' for service, which includes supporting the ''free exercise of religion'' for men and women of all faiths, an ''endorsement'' from an ''endorsing agency'' that is recognized by the Department of Defense, representing one or more faith groups in the United States, will be required, in part to ensure that the separation of church and state is honored. Neither the government as a whole nor the military in particular will be put into the position of determining whether an individual is a ''bona fide'' priest, minister, rabbi, imam, etc. (The requirement for such an endorsement has been in force since 1901, and today many of the various religious endorsing agencies work together under such non-governmental voluntary umbrella groups as the [[National Conference on Ministry to the Armed Forces]].) Although ordination is usually required for chaplain service, some "equivalent" status is accepted for individuals from religious groups which do not have ordination, such as the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]]. Additionally, in cases where an endorsing agency is not yet established for an individual's religion, it is possible for him or her to be endorsed by the endorsing agency of another group, a process which was followed for the first Muslim chaplains in the military. In any event, this endorsement is recognized as ''necessary, but not sufficient'' for acceptance as a chaplain: in other words, the military will not accept an individual for service as a chaplain, nor allow him or her to continue to serve, without such an endorsement remaining in force; however, the decision as to whether to accept that individual remains with the military service, and the individual can be rejected for a number of reasons, including the needs of the military, even with the endorsement of an endorsing agency.

==Non-combatant status==
The [[Geneva Conventions]] are silent on whether chaplains may bear arms. However, the Conventions do state ([[Protocol I]], 8 June 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]: they do not have the right to participate directly in hostilities.

It is generally assumed that during [[World War II]], chaplains were unarmed. Crosby describes an incident where a US chaplain became a trained tank gunner and was removed from the military for this "entirely illegal, not to mention imprudent" action.&lt;ref name="Crosby"&gt;{{cite book | last=Crosby | first=Donald F. | year=1994 | title=Battlefield Chaplains: Catholic Priests in World War II | place=Lawrence, KS | publisher=University Press of Kansas | isbn=0-7006-0814-1 | pages=xxi, xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least some British chaplains serving in the Far East, however, were armed: [[George MacDonald Fraser]] recalls&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fraser | first=G.M. | year=1995 | edition=trade paperback | title=Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma | place=London | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-272687-4 | pages=109, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the tall figure of the battalion chaplain, swinging along good style with his .38 on his hip" immediately behind the lead platoon during a battalion attack. Fraser asks, "if the padre shot [an enemy], what would the harvest be ... apart from three ringing cheers from the whole battalion?"&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;
The Reverend [[Leslie Hardman]], the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army's]] senior Jewish chaplain, who became well known for his work amongst the liberated prisoners after the capture of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], was another who insisted on being armed while on active service.&lt;ref name="GuardianObituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/secondworldwar-judaism | title=Obituary: The Rev Leslie Hardman | work=The Guardian | date=October 13, 2008 | accessdate=15 April 2014 | author=Alderman, Geoffrey | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not [[medical personnel]], to be unarmed in combat, although the US does not prohibit chaplains from earning marksmanship awards or participating in marksmanship competitions. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, and also Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDmclwxTEU&amp;list=UUuuTCooIMbBFHNbPcSS7 "Afghanistan: Chaplains provide comfort to troops"], ''[[SBS World News]]'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; make it an issue of individual conscience. There are anecdotal accounts that even US and UK chaplains have at least occasionally unofficially borne weapons: Chaplain (then Captain) James D. Johnson, of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], Mobile Riverine Force in Vietnam describes (''Combat Chaplain: A Thirty-Year Vietnam Battle'') carrying the M-16 rifle while embedded with a combat patrol. Since 1909 US chaplains on operations have been accompanied by an armed chaplain assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usachcs.army.mil/TACarchive/AC71M/before_the_chaplain_assistant.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624212250/http://www.usachcs.army.mil/TACarchive/AC71M/before_the_chaplain_assistant.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps on this occasion it was felt that an unarmed uniformed man would draw unwelcome attention.

Captured chaplains are not considered [[prisoners of war]] and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949, Chapter IV Art 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Inevitably, serving chaplains have died in action. The [[US Army]] and [[US Marines|Marines]] lost 100 chaplains killed in action during World War II: the third highest casualty rate behind the [[infantry]] and the [[Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref name="Crosby"/&gt; Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have been awarded Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]], and nine have received the [[Medal of Honor]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|US military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others.

In 2006, training materials obtained by US intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the training materials, there included an insurgent sniper training manual that was posted on the Internet. Among its tips for shooting US troops, there read: "Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare."

==Chief of chaplains/chaplain general==
[[File:Riley Chaplain-General.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anglican Archbishop Riley addressing a crowd as 'Chaplain-General to the AIF']]
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}

Military chaplains are often supervised by a [[chaplain general]] or chief of chaplains, on the staff of the leader of the nation's military forces. In some countries, like Israel, Canada, and South Africa, one chief of chaplains/chaplain general serves in that position for all chaplains of all religions, in all branches of the military.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In many other countries, such as France, there is a separate chaplain general/chief of chaplains for each faith group represented by chaplains.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In other countries, like the United States, there is one chaplain general/[[Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States|chief of chaplains]] for each branch of the military. So, for example, in the United States, there is an [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Army|Army]], [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Chief of Chaplains of the United States Air Force|Air Force]] chief of chaplains. They meet on as representatives to the [[Armed Forces Chaplains Board]],&lt;ref name=AFCB&gt;[http://www.mfr.usmc.mil/HQ/Chaplains/Instructions/DOD%205120.08p%20Armed%20Forces%20Chaplains%20Board.pdf Armed Forces Chaplains Board]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (AFCB). Instruction Number 5120.08 (August 20, 2007). US Department of Defense. Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss issues that cross service lines, but each reports as a staff officer of his or her service, to the Chief of Staff of the Army or Air Force, or the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] of the Navy. (In the United States, Navy chaplains serve Navy, [[Chaplain of the United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and [[Chaplain of the Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] personnel. Navy chaplains also assigned to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]], for Merchant Marine personnel.)

==International organization==
The [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] grew out of a conference [[NATO]] chiefs of chaplains organized by the [[United States European Command]] (USEUCOM) in 1990.&lt;ref name=OpeningOfTheFirstInternational&gt;{{cite web|first=S Lt L.A |last=Benjamin |title=Opening of the First International Military Chief of Chaplains Conference |url=http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0902/090204_Chaplains_conference/article.htm |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075245/http://www.navy.mil.za/archive/0902/090204_Chaplains_conference/article.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It welcomes any chief of chaplains (or ''chaplain general'', an equivalent term used by many nations).

==Religions and faith group organization==
===Christianity===

====Roman Catholic Church====
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
[[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] chaplains are generally organized into [[military ordinariate]]s, such as the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA|Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA]]. Potential Roman Catholic chaplains must seek permission from their [[diocesan bishop|diocesan]] [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] or [[religious superior]] to serve as a military chaplain. While serving as a chaplain, the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] or [[deacon]] remains [[incardinated]] in his home [[diocese]], but is temporarily under the direction of the [[prelate]] of the ordinariate for the duration of his service.

====Protestant denominations====
Each of the various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christian denominations may set its own requirements for certification as a minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.robis.net/uploads/JID44_Military%20Chaplaincy%20guidelines%20final.pdf Serving the Lord as a Chaplain in the Armed Forces of the United States of America]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (adopted by the Home Missions Commission, June 2000). North American Baptist Conference. Retrieved 2010-09-10. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Jewish service during World War I.jpg|thumb|Austrian Jewish military service during WWI (1914-18).]]
Besides the [[Military Rabbinate]] of Israel, today, military [[rabbi]]s serve throughout several countries of the world, most notably in the US military forces, and various European armies.
Since the rise of the Christian religion in Europe and worldwide, as a matter of course Christians fought against Christians over and over again. During World War I, for the first time a substantial number of Jews served on all sides of the war, and so did military rabbis. As a result of 18th and 19th centuries` emancipation, ''military field rabbis'' served on all fronts and in all combating nations.

==Badges and insignia==
[[File:Usnavy worshippennant.GIF|thumb|right|110px|Worship Pennant, flying over the National Ensign (American flag) on a US Navy ship.&lt;ref&gt;Per Navy customs, traditions and etiquette, [[Pennant (church)#United States Navy|Worship Pennants]] may be flown above the Ensign {{cite web | title=Naval Customs, Traditions, &amp; Etiquette – Church Pennant | url=http://www.public.navy.mil/usff/Pages/customs.aspx#churchpennant | work=US Fleet Forces | publisher=United States Navy | date= | accessdate= | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613045812/http://www.public.navy.mil/usff/Pages/customs.aspx#churchpennant | archive-date=2015-06-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Badges and insignia vary widely across nations and services; though generally include some form of symbol specific to the individual chaplain's religion.

In addition to badges and insignias for individual chaplains, certain nations, including the United States, fly a [[Pennant (church)|Church or Worship Pennant]] during the time a chaplain leads a religious worship service, especially on ships at sea.  On United States Navy ships it is the only pennant that flies above the United States flag.

==Military chaplains by country==

===Argentina===

Roman Catholic military chaplains served in the Argentine armed forces since the early nineteenth century, and wore officers´ uniforms and ranks.
However, the use of these was discontinued in the 1970s in the Army and the Air Force, and in the 2000s in the Navy, due to allegations of some chaplains supposedly abusing their military position and thus discouraging their subordinates to approach them when in need. Nevertheless, chaplains continue to wear combat uniform (but no rank insignia) when accompanying the troops in field operations or exercises, and are still considered as a part of the officers corps.
No specific provisions exist for the spiritual support to non-Catholics.

===Australia===

====Army and Air Force====
[[File:Small box respirator.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An Australian chaplain wearing the "Large Box Respirator" also known as the "Respiratory Tower" during the First World War, Bois Grenier Sector on 5th June 1916.]]

{{See also|Royal Australian Army Chaplains' Department}}
Chaplains in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have almost the same status as chaplains in the British armed services. Chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) are [[commissioned officers]] and wear the uniform of officers of their particular branch of the services as well as the rank to which they are qualified. Chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] begin their commission as a Captain (Army) or Flight Lieutenant (RAAF) respectively. There are five levels or "divisions" for the seniority of chaplains in the Australian Army and Air Force with each division corresponding to a worn rank. The highest "division" is Division 5 who are "principal chaplains," of which there are three per service representing the three major Christian denominations: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]]. The principal chaplains of the Army wear the rank of brigadier and in the RAAF, air commodore. Australian Army chaplains, whatever their rank, are mostly referred to as "Padre" by officers and soldiers alike. The title is also widely used in the RAAF for their chaplains.

====Navy====
:''See: [[Royal Australian Navy#Chaplains]]''
Like chaplains in the [[Australian Army]] and RAAF, [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) chaplains are [[commissioned officers]] and wear the uniform of an RAN officer, but like chaplains in the British Royal Navy (RN) they do not wear a rank. Rather they wear the same cross and anchor emblem worn by RN chaplains on their shoulder rank slides and do not have gold braided rings or executive loops on their winter sleeve coat or summer shoulder boards. Like other chaplains in the ADF, Navy chaplains have five divisions of seniority. Whilst Australian Navy chaplains do not wear rank, they are accorded a certain rank for protocol and ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes. Division 1, 2 and 3 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status as [[Commander]] (Lieutenant Colonel equivalent in the Australian Army). Division 4 Australian Navy chaplains are accorded the rank and status of Captain (equiv. of Colonel). Division 5 Australian Navy chaplains are "principal chaplains," and these three chaplains, representing the three major Christian denominations: [[Catholic]], [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]], are accorded the rank and status of [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]. The title "Padre" for chaplains is less common and not officially encouraged in the Royal Australian Navy, although it is known to be used by some sailors and Navy chaplains in preference to the more formal title of "chaplain" or form of address towards an officer such as "sir." Like British Royal Navy chaplains, Royal Australian Navy chaplains wear a slightly different peaked cap to other Navy officers which apparently was designed by [[Winston Churchill]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Heads of denominations====
In the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the heads of military chaplaincy for those Christian denominations and of the Jewish faith that have an official association with the ADF, are also members of the ADF's "Religious Advisory Committee" (RAC). With respect to the [[Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] churches, their Bishops are members of RAC and they and the other members of RAC have the status of a two star General (US) or Major General (Australian Army), or Rear Admiral (RAN) or Air Vice-Marshal (RAAF).

The Anglican and Roman Catholic strands of Australian Defence Force Chaplaincy have websites that explain their church's mission within the Australian Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceanglicans.org.au|title=Defence Anglicans - Home|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.catholic.org.au|title=Catholic Diocese of the Australian Defence Force|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Protestant strand does not have a website, one of their chaplains has a representative blog site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.padresponderings.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
Belgium has chaplains for its army, and is mainly a Catholic chaplaincy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army-chaplaincy.be/befr/&lt;/ref&gt;

*Offer a ministry of presence in a multitude of environments (at home and abroad)
*Participate in the life of the worshipping community
*Officiate at special functions
*Advise the Commanding Officer regarding the spiritual and ethical well-being and morale of their unit
*Liaise with civilian religious faith groups
*Collaborate with other care providers
*Provide directed care after critical incidents&lt;ref name="cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca"/&gt;
When offering prayers during parades and ceremonies, it is customary that the order to remove headdress be given to those on parade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/pub/oth-aut/rd-js/rd-js-eng.asp#par-14 |title=DHH - About DHH |publisher=Cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, [[Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada]] ruled that this order was "not lawful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Court Martial Appeals Court of Canada |url=http://decisions.cmac-cacm.ca/site/cmac-cacm/cmac-cacm/en/item/7837/index.do?r=AAAAAQAGcHJheWVyAAAAAAAAAQ |title=CMAC - Decisions |publisher=Decisions.cmac-cacm.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it unjustifiably required all attendees to show participation in a prayer that that may not believe. Following this ruling, non-believers are now permitted to retain their headdress just like [[Jews]] and [[Sikh]]s do in accordance with their faith.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Denmark===

===France===
[[File:Aumôniers militaires de la Place de Strasbourg, juin 2013.jpg|thumb|right|upright|French military chaplains Jewish, Muslim and Catholic, Place de Strasbourg 2013]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], the cloak of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] of Tours, (''cappa Sancti Martini''), one of the most sacred [[relic]]s of the Frankish kings, would be carried everywhere the king went, even into battle, as a holy relic upon which [[oath]]s were sworn. The clergyman who served as custodian for the cloak in its [[reliquary]] was called a ''capellānus'', and, by extension, all clergymen who officiated in reliquaries, sanctuaries, or chapels were eventually called ''cappellāni''. This eventually gave ''chapelain'' in Old French and was borrowed into English.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Henri Joseph Brahain Ducange|Ducange]], ''Glossarium'', s.v "Capella)", noted in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v.'' "Chapel".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] was the king who gave legal status to the military chaplains, since chaplains serving under their lord in the Crusades were the first to be militarized. In 1531, during the [[Battle of Kappel]], the Swiss reformist [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the very first Protestant military chaplain to be killed on the battlefield.

The modern French ''Aumônerie militaire'' (military chaplaincy) was created and instituted by a July 8, 1880 Act of Parliament, which sets forth how the chaplaincy functions with regard to the Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths. The Secularism Act (1905), which establishes a strict [[separation of church and state]] in the French government, does not however apply to the military. The defense minister appoints three command-level military chaplains—one per faith—in charge of all chaplains. The chaplains, serving in the army, are assigned by one of these three military chaplains. The first Muslim chaplain-general, Abdelkader Arbi, was commissioned in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2289423&amp;rubId=4078 |title=Ils sont les tout premiers aumôniers généraux musulmans |language=fr |publisher=La-Croix.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French military chaplains wear a uniform since [[World War II]], but have no rank or rank insignia. The modern military chaplaincy is rooted in that war, where military chaplains were incorporated in almost every [[Free French Forces]] fighting unit and made up of personnel from England, France, or any of its imperial domains. After the war, military chaplains were sent to occupation zones in Germany and Austria.

In the 1950s, military chaplains where sent in the [[French Union]]'s territories, including [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. In 1954, pastor Tissot was one of the last paratrooper volunteers to jump over the besieged [[Dien Bien Phu]] fortified camp in northern [[Vietnam]]. On May 7, he was made prisoner of the [[Viet Minh]] and sent to a re-education camp, deep in the jungle.

Since 1984, French military chaplains are involved in every military operation—including the [[Gulf War]]—from [[Rapid Reaction Force]] (''Force d'Action Rapide'') units to navy ships.

In [[France]], the existence of military chaplains has come under debate because of the separation of Church and State; however, their position has been maintained {{As of|2004|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925085650/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/orgs_ext/aumoneries/ |date=September 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially only Christian chaplains worked in German armies. Only after the [[French Revolution]] did Jews become citizens with equal rights in Germany for the first time. An integration of Jewish soldiers within the army gave the German Reich the opportunity to recognize the Jewish urge to fight for the German “Fatherland”. The times of common Christian suppression and supremachy status changed and more and more German Jews served in the liberal French Armies of the German territories under French influence, e.g. in the Bavarian army.

In Prussia, king [[Frederick the Great]] also showed religious tolerance, but in case of the Jews he exerted intolerance. The Jews were divided into six classes, and only the privileged first class had ''de facto'' equal rights as citizens. Very few Jewish soldiers in the Prussian army of the 18th century left historical traces, e.g. Konstantin Nathanel of Salomon, who was promoted to general in 1760. Although the Jewish presence in Germany is older than Christianity,&lt;ref name=bergerM&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Michael|title=Eisernes Kreuz und Davidstern : die Geschichte jüdischer Soldaten in deutschen Armeen|year=2006|publisher=Trafo|location=Berlin|isbn=3-89626-476-1|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first "field rabbinat" was introduced during World War I. The German Kaiserreich appointed c. 30 military rabbis. Field rabbi Dr. [[Leo Baeck]] wrote the “Israelite Field Prayer Book”.

====World War II====

Germany had a tradition of appointing Catholic and Evangelical military chaplains and Jewish military field rabbis. This was continued in the Army and Navy of the [[Wehrmacht]], for the Roman Catholic and Protestant denominations only. A total of 95% of all Germans being Christian, German soldiers during Nazi times continued to belong to the churches and had the words "Gott mit uns" (''God with us'') on the belt buckles of every Army and Navy enlisted men and non-commissioned officers.&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susannah_Heschel_2008"/&gt; Despite this proportion of Christians, the totalitarian national socialistic government of the German Reich tried to weaken the authority and influence of the churches over their German adherents. Besides the international ''[[Jewish question]]'', the international character of the Catholic church was another challenge. A few Catholics who devoutly resisted the Nazis, suffered imprisonment and hardship. The case was solved by the [[Reichskonkordat]] (1933) between the [[Holy See]] and Nazi Germany. The government of the German Reich early established an pastoral ministry for the German Army and the Reichskonkordat settled the appointment of an Army bishop. Therefore, the military chaplains could more freely operate out of the Catholic hierarchy. [[Franz Justus Rarkowski]], [[Society of Mary (Marists)|S.M.]], became ordained the Catholic military Field Bishop (''Feldbischof'') of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 until 1945.

German military chaplains who served the Wehrmacht were part of the German mainstream and lent the Nazi war effort legitimacy. The Christian military chaplains served between strange poles. While the Nazi ideology was at its core pagan (the elite [[SS]] units never allowed chaplains), 95% of Germans were baptized Christians. German soldiers during the Nazi era continued to belong to the churches and had the words "Gott mit uns" (''God with us'') on their belt buckles. “Being a chaplain in the German army had always been a prestigious position and the Nazis wanted people who represented that old military tradition (..) and not sow discord or division. They wanted people who were not troublemakers.2&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt; The German military chaplains mostly wanted to bring the word of the Christian God to men in the field and to deliver the sacraments, make their families proud and serve their country. “The motives of the chaplains were not unusual, (..) their noble, personal and professional motives turned them into a legitimating force in a war of annihilation.”&lt;ref name=bergen2013/&gt; Military chaplains in Nazi Germany were rigorously screened. First, names were put on the desks of the local civilian bishops, and then the names had to be approved by the according ministry for church affairs. Eventually the names were cleared by the military’s chaplaincy office and the [[Gestapo]] ("Secret State Police").&lt;ref name=bergen2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Bergen|first=Prof. Dr. Doris|title=German military chaplains caught between word of God and horror of man|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2011/11/06/military-chaplains-caught-between-word-of-god-and-horror-of-man/|work=Holy Post|publisher=2013 National Post|accessdate=26 August 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111107113447/http://life.nationalpost.com/2011/11/06/military-chaplains-caught-between-word-of-god-and-horror-of-man/|archive-date=2011-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bergen2&gt;{{cite web|last=BERGEN|first=Prof. Doris L.|title=German Military Chaplains in World War II and the Dilemmas of Legitimacy|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/German+Military+Chaplains+in+World+War+II+and+the+Dilemmas+of...-a076751697|publisher=2001 American Society of Church History|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Organization and clothing=====
Throughout the [[Third Reich]] period, only the Army and Navy had military chaplains. When needed, other branches of the armed forces acquired chaplains from the Army or Navy or from nearby parish. In the Heer (Army), military chaplains were organized into Group 3b (Pastoral Group) of the General Army Office under the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army High Command]]. In mid 1935, four groups of military chaplains were introduced. In 1936, similar groups were introduced for the [[Kriegsmarine]] although the evolution over time was different. The groups are as follow.&lt;ref name=hayden&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayden|first=Mark|title=German military chaplains in World War II|year=2005|publisher=Schiffer Pub.|location=Atglen, PA|isbn=9780764321566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oberpfarrer''' (Higher Priest)
* '''Pfarrer''' (Priest)
* '''Standortpfarrer im Hauptamt''' (Garrison Priest in Main Office)
* '''Standortpfarrer im Nebenamt''' (Garrison Priest for Outside Appointment)

German military chaplains did not get into the ordinary military rank system, but received privileges like any other regular officers. Army chaplains had four different types of clothing:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Uniformen der Deutschen Wehrmacht: einschließlich Ausrüstung und Seitenwaffen|year=1939|publisher=Verlag Otto Dietrich|location=Berlin|isbn=3931533379}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Feldbluse''' (''Field Dress''). Field dress was identical for enlisted men, non-commissioned officers, and officers, and was worn on the battlefield. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used.
* '''Dienstrock''' (''Service Dress''). Service dress was the typical dress for officers, with high quality materials and tailor made. For military chaplains, the field dress was worn with officer-quality collar patches and without shoulder boards. Service dress was normally used behind the lines although photographic evidences also show this kind of uniform was worn on the battlefield. Long trousers with shoes or breeches with officer boots could be worn. Two-pronged officer's belt was used, sometimes with cross strap.
* '''Überrock''' (''Frock Coat''). Frock coat was used for formal occasions and when ordered, and worn over the service dress. The piping was violet.
* '''Mantel''' (''Overcoat''). Overcoat worn by military chaplains was identical to those worn by officers. However, no shoulder boards were attached. This was worn over the field dress or service dress.

No weapon was permitted to be carried by chaplains, but one photographic evidence shows a chaplain with a pistol holster on his left waist.

For the headdresses of the Army chaplains, the most common were:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* '''Schirmmütze''' (''Visor Cap''). Officer-quality visor cap with violet as the branch color (''[[Waffenfarbe]]'') for military chaplains. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, either made of metal or embroidered.
* '''Feldmütze''' (''Field Cap''). Officer-quality field cap with silver pipings and violet soutache as the ''Waffenfarbe''. Between the national eagle and cockade, there was a small Gothic cross, usually embroidered.

All the buttons, national eagles, cockades, Gothic crosses, and cap chinstraps were silver for military chaplains and gold for Field Bishops.
The collar patches had violet underlay and violet piping for Catholic chaplains, and field grey underlay and violet piping for Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains.

For the Kriegsmarine, the uniform was identical to naval jacket of regular officers, but without sleeve laces and with chaplain collar patches. The collar patches were different to those of the Army. Two-prong officer's belt or brocade belt could be worn.

Although the official regulation states that military chaplains had to wear golden [[pectoral cross]], there were two standard-issue crosses that were worn:&lt;ref name=hayden/&gt;
* For Catholic chaplains, [[Crucifix|Corpus Christi]] was present on the cross. The cross itself was made either of metal or silver, with black wood insert. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck.
* For Protestant (Evangelist) chaplains, the cross was plain and made of metal or silver. Long metal chains went through a loop at the top of the cross to be worn around the neck.

Photographic evidences show numerous variety of pectoral crosses worn by German military chaplains during World War II.

Oftentimes, German military chaplains were issued an armband with a red cross sign and violet stripe to show their neutrality on the battlefield. This was called ''Armbinde mit Neutralitätsabzeichen '' (Armband with Neutrality Sign).

Among other things, military chaplains also wore standard liturgical [[Vestment|vestments]] such as chasuble, cope, and stole.

German religious constitutional law and its state-church law is involved in the democratic national identity of modern Germany, especially in various articles of the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. Initially, a "military-chaplaincy" contract was only signed between the state and the Protestant Church, but was extended to all other religious communities for reasons of parity.&lt;ref name=pschnabel&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnabel|first=Patrick Roger|title=About the Relationship of State and Religion|url=http://fit-for-gender.org/downloads/P-Schnabel-Staat-Religion_eng.pdf|publisher=2007 fit-for-gender.org|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the 1930s '''Reichskonkordat''' between the Holy See and Germany is still in force. In Germany, military chaplains of the [[Bundeswehr]] have no rank but have a special civilian status as part of the armed forces.

The Military Rabbinate is a unit in the Israel Defense Forces that provides religious services for military personnel, Jewish and non-Jewish, and makes decisions on issues of religion and military affairs. The Military Rabbinate is headed by the Chief Military Rabbi, who carries the rank of a Brigadier General.

The Military Rabbinate constitutes the body responsible for religious institutions in the military. In every unit or military base there are Military Rabbinate military personnel assigned responsibility for conducting or coordinating religious services, overseeing the [[Kashrut|kosher operation]] of the kitchen, and the maintenance of the synagogue and religious supplies. Actively serving military personnel can request Military Rabbinate representatives to perform marriage ceremonies and [[Brit Milah|''brit mila'']], circumcision ceremonies, for babies. The unit also oversees the legal and religious certification of marriages and divorces of individuals during their military service.

The Military Rabbinate is responsible for treating the bodies of soldiers in accordance with religious law, including the identifications and post-mortem treatment of bodies, and conducting military funerals. The Military Rabbinate also coordinates the burial of enemy soldiers and the exhuming of bodies in conjunction with prisoner exchanges.

The Military Rabbinate was founded in 1948 by Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who headed it until 1968.

===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands has chaplains of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and humanist faiths, provided by the De Diensten Geestelijke Verzorging (DGV) or the Spiritual Care Services. Chaplains are trained in Vormingscentrum Landgoed Beukbergen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.defensie.nl/onderwerpen/personeelszorg/geestelijke-verzorging&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
[[File:Military chaplain of the Norwegian Army.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Military chaplain of the Norwegian Army in front of a [[Crucifix|Christian Cross]], Oslo, 2010.]] The chaplain service in Norway is called the Feltprestkorpset, or the Field Priest Corps, and is a joint Norwegian Armed Forces service. &lt;ref&gt;https://forsvaret.no/organisasjon/forsvarets-fellestjenester&lt;/ref&gt;


===South Africa===
[[File:Fumanekile Gqiba.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Fumanekile Gqiba]], former Chaplain General of the S. African National Defense Force, and former South African Ambassador to Israel, 1998]]
Prior to 1968, chaplains wore badges of rank as [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniforminsignia.net/index.php?p=show&amp;id=42&amp;sid=1312 Rank Insignia – Army Land Forces: South Africa: Military Chaplains since 2002]. International Encyclopedia of Uniform Insignia Association. Retrieved 2010-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1968, however, all chaplains have been senior officers and accorded the protocol status of [[colonel]] / [[captain (navy)]]. They carry the military rank of [[chaplain]] and the rank insignia, which is unique to the Chaplains Service, comprises a [[Chi Rho]] monogramme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/Christianity/christian_symbols.html |title=Christian Symbols |publisher=Atschool.eduweb.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723094739/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/carolrb/christianity/christian_symbols.html |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by a triangle. The monogramme represents the first two letters of Christ in [[Greek language|Greek]]. It originates from the days of [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the first [[Roman Emperor|Emperor of Rome]] to grant religious freedom to [[Christian]]s. His own conversion to the Christian faith was initiated by a dream in which the Chi-Rho monogramme appeared to him. The triangle surrounding the monogramme is the symbolic representation of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].

During the vision of the monogramme, Constantine [[Constantine I#War against Maxentius|heard the Latin words ''in hoc signo vinces'']]. The English translation of these [[Latin]] words is: "In this sign, you will conquer". This is the motto of the Chaplains Service and forms part of the [[Corps]] Badge.

In 1998, after working as chaplain general in exile for the ANC, the [[African National Congress]], during the fight against apartheid, [[Fumanekile Gqiba]] was appointed as the first black chaplain general for SANDF, the [[South African National Defense Force]]. In 2004, Major General Gqiba left the military to accept his appointment as South African Ambassador to Israel.

In the SANDF Chaplain Service, the [[Hindu]] faith is represented by a Regular Force chaplain. The rank is Cpln (Vipra) and the mode of address Vipra. The rank insignia is a deepa (lamp) with flame. This is the symbolic representation of enlightenment, the life objective of all Hindus.

The [[Muslim]]s do not have Regular Force chaplains in the SANDF because they are small in number. They are however served by part-time workers through the Chaplains Service of the SANDF and are addressed according to their religious customs as [[imam]]s.

Christian chaplains are generally referred to and addressed as Padre. They may however, be addressed according to the practice of their religious bodies e.g., Father, [[Pastor]], Umfundisi ([[Zulu people|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]), Moruti ([[Sotho people|Sotho]]), Dominee ([[Afrikaans]]) etc. The official written form of address is ''Cpln'' (for chaplain) followed by the appropriate ecclesiastical title of the respective chaplain e.g., Cpln (Rev), Cpln (Fr), Cpln (Pastor), Cpln, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaplain.mil.za/aboutus/about_us.htm |title=SANDF |publisher=Chaplain.mil.za |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202091248/http://www.chaplain.mil.za/aboutus/about_us.htm |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with chaplains from many other nations in the southern region of the continent of Africa, South African chaplains participate in SARMCA, the ''South Africa Regional Military Chaplains Association'', which is a component organization of SADC, the ''[[Southern African Development Community]]''.

The first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the eighth century AD. Land based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]], although their duties included jobs that today would come under the jurisdiction of [[military engineer]]s and [[medical]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. A priest attached to a feudal noble household would follow his [[Feudalism|liege]] lord into battle. In 1796 the Parliament of [[Great Britain]] passed a [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] that established the [[Army Chaplains' Department]] in the [[British Army]]. The Department was awarded its "Royal" prefix in 1919 in recognition of their chaplains' service during World War I.

The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]]. A chaplain provides spiritual and pastoral support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea or in the field. In the Royal Navy chaplains are traditionally addressed by their Christian name, or with one of many nicknames (Bish; Sin-Bosun; Devil Dodger; Sky-Pilot etc.). In the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]], chaplains are traditionally referred to (and addressed) as ''padre'' or as Sir/Ma'am (although not the latter in the RAF).

In the [[Royal Navy]] chaplains have no rank other than "chaplain" while in the [[British Army]] they hold commissioned relative rank but are universally referred to as Padre.  On the foundation of the [[Royal Air Force]] Chaplains' Branch an attempt was made to amalgamate these differing systems creating "Relative Rank", where rank is worn but without executive authority. In practice chaplains of all three services work in similar ways using what influence and authority they have on behalf of those who consult them or seek their advice.

During World War II the head of chaplaincy in the British Army was an ([[Anglican]]) [[chaplain-general]], (a [[major-general]]), who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces&lt;/ref&gt; An assistant chaplain-general was a chaplain 1st class (full [[colonel]]) and a senior chaplain was a chaplain 2nd class ([[lieutenant colonel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) ''The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale''. London: Adam &amp; Charles Black&lt;/ref&gt;

All chaplains are [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] and wear uniform. [[British Army]] and [[Royal Air Force]] chaplains bear ranks and wear rank insignia, but [[Royal Navy]] chaplains do not, wearing a cross and a special version of the officers' [[cap badge]] as their only insignia.

Chaplains in the armed forces were previously all [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Judaism|Jewish]]. The first Jewish chaplain was appointed in 1892 and some 20 to 30 were commissioned during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Phil Groom |url=http://www.ccj-hillingdon.org.uk/news.htm |title=Military Chaplaincy, Christian and Jewish perspectives, November 2005 |publisher=Ccj-hillingdon.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625042626/http://ccj-hillingdon.org.uk/news.htm |archivedate=2014-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recent times, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) has employed only Christian chaplains, with the Jewish community providing an honorary chaplain under long-standing arrangements, although Jewish chaplains have served in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. In October 2005 the Ministry of Defence appointed four chaplains to the military; one each from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam|Muslim]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4355896.stm | work=BBC News | title=Non-Christian chaplains appointed | date=2005-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Museum of Army Chaplaincy]] holds information and archive material relating to the history of the [[RAChD|Army Chaplains' Department.]]

In the era before [[call sign]]s the radio "appointment title" for the Padre was "Sky pilot".

In the [[United States]], military chaplains have an officer's rank based on their years of service and promotion selection from among their peers. Chaplains serving in the US Armed Forces wear the uniform of their respective branch of service, and normally wear clerical attire only during the performance of a religious service. The position of rank and chaplain faith group insignia [[Religious symbolism in the United States military|varies in each military department]] and may vary significantly from one type of uniform to another within a military department.

The [[Civil Air Patrol]], the volunteer Auxiliary of the USAF, also has chaplains, who must meet the same standards for appointment as active-duty Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard chaplains.

The [[United States military chaplains#Constitutionality|constitutionality of the US chaplaincy]] has been the subject of legal challenges and scholarly dispute. One appellate case, ''Katcoff v. Marsh'' (1985) upheld the system as a permissible attempt to support service members in the "free exercise" of their religious beliefs, though others have described the details of the chaplaincy system as violations of the legal principles that the federal government maintain neutrality and avoid becoming entangled in religious affairs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42986">'''Morality and religion''' is the relationship between [[religion|religious]] views and [[morals]]. Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Gems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Zoroastrianism#Principal beliefs|Zoroastrianism's]] "good thoughts, good words, and good deeds" concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|edition= |last= Esptein|first= Greg M.|year= 2010|publisher= HarperCollins|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-06-167011-4|page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frameworks are outlined and interpreted by various sources such as holy books, oral and written traditions, and religious leaders. Many of these share tenets with [[secular]] value frameworks such as [[consequentialism]], [[freethought]], and [[utilitarianism]].

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not necessarily depend upon religion, though for some, this is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Rachels| first1 = (ed) James | last2 =  Rachels | first2 = (ed) Stuart | title = The Elements of Moral Philosophy | publisher = McGraw-Hill| edition = 7 | year = 2011| location = New York| page = | isbn = 0-07-803824-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'', religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress| first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie| first2 = (ed) John  | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press| edition = | year = 1986| location = Philadelphia| page = 401| isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the views of others, the two can overlap. According to one definition, morality is an active process which is, "at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason, that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing, while giving equal consideration to the interests of all those affected by what one does."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt;

[[Value judgment]]s can vary greatly between religions, past and present. People in various religious traditions, such as [[Christianity]], may derive ideas of right and wrong from the rules and laws set forth in their respective authoritative guides and by their religious leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|edition= | authorlink = Simon Blackburn|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equating morality to adherence to authoritative commands in a holy book is the [[Divine Command Theory]].&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"/&gt; [[Polytheistic]] religions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] generally draw from some of the broadest canons of religious works.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhippriya Subhadra Siriwardena, [http://www.lankaweb.com/dhamma/view12.html 'The Buddhist perspective of lay morality'], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; There has been interest in the relationship between religion and crime and other behavior that does not adhere to contemporary laws and [[social norm]]s in various countries. Studies conducted in recent years have explored these relationships, but the results have been mixed and sometimes contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Saint George, [http://www.prisoners.com/relcrime.html "Religion's Effects On  Crime Rates"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of religious faiths to provide value frameworks that are seen as useful is a debated matter. Religious commentators have asserted that a moral life cannot be led without an [[Divine law|absolute lawgiver]] as a guide. Other observers assert that moral behavior does not rely on religious tenets, and secular commentators point to ethical challenges within various religions that conflict with contemporary social norms.

== Relationship between religion and morality ==
Within the wide range of ethical traditions, religious traditions co-exist with secular value frameworks such as [[humanism]], [[utilitarianism]], and others. There are many types of religious values. Modern [[monotheistic]] religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (and to a certain degree others such as [[Sikhism]]) define right and wrong by the laws and rules set forth by their respective gods and as interpreted by religious leaders within the respective faith. [[Polytheistic]] religious traditions tend to be less absolute. For example, within [[Buddhism]], the intention of the individual and the circumstances play roles in determining whether an action is right or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Morgan, "Buddhism." In {{cite book |title = Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition = Second|editor1-first =  Peggy|editor1-last = Morgan|editor2-first = Clive A. | editor2-last = Lawton|year = 2007|publisher = Columbia University Press|location = |isbn = 978-0-7486-2330-3 |pages = 61, 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Stoler Miller]] points out a further disparity between the morals of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, "practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna's Counsel in Time of War |last =  Miller|first = Barbara Stoler|year = 2004|publisher = Random House|location = New York|isbn = 0-553-21365-2 |page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Gaukroger]]: "It was generally assumed in the 17th century that religion provided the unique basis for morality, and that without religion, there could be no morality."&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"&gt;{{cite book |title = Objectivity: A Very Short Introduction|edition = |last = Gaukroger|first = Stephen|year = 2012|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-960669-6|page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view slowly shifted over time. In 1690, [[Pierre Bayle]] asserted that religion "is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality".&lt;ref name="Gaukroger 2012 91"/&gt; Modern sources separate the two concepts. For example, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;For many religious people, morality and religion are the same or inseparable; for them either morality is part of religion or their religion is their morality. For others, especially for nonreligious people, morality and religion are distinct and separable; religion may be immoral or nonmoral, and morality may or should be nonreligious. Even for some religious people the two are different and separable; they may hold that religion should be moral and morality should be, but they agree that they may not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 =  Childress | first1 = (ed) James F. | last2 =  Macquarrie | first2 = (ed) John | title = The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics | publisher = The Westminster Press | edition = | year = 1986 | location = Philadelphia | page = 400 | isbn = 0-664-20940-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richard Paula and Linda Elder of the Foundation for Critical Thinking assert that, "Most people confuse ethics with behaving in accordance with social conventions, religious beliefs, and the law." They separate the concept of ethics from these topics, stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;The proper role of ethical reasoning is to highlight acts of two kinds: those which enhance the well-being of others—that warrant our praise—and those that harm or diminish the well-being of others—and thus warrant our criticism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Miniature Guide to Understanding the Foundations of Ethical Reasoning|edition = |last1 = Paul|first1 = Richard|last2 = Elder|first2 = Linda|year = 2006|publisher = Foundation for Critical Thinking Free Press|location = United States|isbn = 0-944583-17-2|pages = np}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; They note problems that could arise if religions defined ethics, such as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

# religious practices like "torturing unbelievers or burning them alive" potentially being labeled "ethical"
# the lack of a common religious baseline across humanity because religions provide different theological definitions for the idea of [[sin]]

They further note that various documents, such as the [[UN Declaration of Human Rights]] lay out "transcultural" and "trans-religious" ethical concepts and principles—such as slavery, genocide, torture, sexism, racism, murder, assault, fraud, deceit, and intimidation—which require no reliance on religion (or social convention) for us to understand they are "ethically wrong".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Armin Geertz suggests that "the age-old assumption that religion produces morals and values is neither the only, nor the most parsimonious, hypothesis for religion".&lt;ref&gt;

== Religious frameworks ==
Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, there is no absolute prohibition on killing in [[Hinduism]], which recognizes that it "may be inevitable and indeed necessary" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Menski, "Hinduism." In {{cite book |title= Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions |edition= Second|editor1-first=  Peggy|editor1-last= Morgan|editor2-first= Clive A. | editor2-last= Lawton|year= 2007|publisher= Columbia University Press|location= |isbn= 978-0-7486-2330-3 |page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian traditions, certain acts are viewed in more absolute terms, such as [[abortion]] or [[divorce]]. In the latter case, a 2008 study by the Barna Group found that some denominations have a significantly higher divorce rate than those in non-religious demographic groups (atheists and agnostics). However Catholics and Evangelical Christians had the lowest divorce rates and the agnostic/atheist group had by far the lowest number of married couples to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|title= New Marriage and Divorce Statistics Released|author= Barna Group|date= 31 March 2008|publisher= Barna Group|accessdate= 19 November 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141219120231/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/15-familykids/42-new-marriage-and-divorce-statistics-released|archivedate= 19 December 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Dixon, "Many today&amp;nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| pages = 115| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/Atheism.html|title=Strategies for Dialoguing with Atheists|author=Ron Rhodes|publisher=[http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/ Reasoning from the Scriptures Ministries]|accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Dixon states, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."&lt;ref name="Dixon 2008 115"/&gt;

== Religion and social dimensions ==

The study of religion and morality is contentious due to conceptual differences.  The ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definition of religiosity all contribute to conflicting findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=R|last2=Whitehouse|first2=H|title=Religion and morality.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=March 2015|volume=141|issue=2|pages=447–73|doi=10.1037/a0038455|pmid=25528346|pmc=4345965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=Does religious belief promote prosociality? A critical examination.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=876–906|doi=10.1037/a0028251|pmid=22925142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership of a religious group can accentuate biases in behavior toward in group versus out group members, which may explain the lower number of interracial friends and greater approval of torture among church members.  Furthermore, some studies have shown that religious prosociality is primarily motivated by wanting to appear prosocial, which may be related to the desire to further ones religious group.  The egoistically motivated prosociality may also affect self-reports, resulting in biased results. Peer ratings can be biased by stereotypes, and indications of a persons group affiliation are sufficient to bias reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galen|first1=LW|title=The complex and elusive nature of religious prosociality: reply to Myers (2012) and Saroglou (2012).|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=September 2012|volume=138|issue=5|pages=918–23|doi=10.1037/a0029278|pmid=22925145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are racially segregated, and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

According to global research done by Gallup on people from 145 countries, adherents of all the major world religions who attended religious services in the past week reported higher rates of generosity such as donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger than do their coreligionists who did not attend services (non-attenders). Even for people who were nonreligious, those who said they attended religious services in the past week exhibited more generous behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Rodney|last2=Smith|first2=Buster G.|title=Religious Attendance Relates to Generosity Worldwide|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122807/religious-attendance-relates-generosity-worldwide.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another global study by Gallup on people from 140 countries showed that highly religious people are more likely to help others in terms of donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers despite them having, on average, lower incomes than those who are less religious or nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crabtree|first1=Steve|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett|title=Worldwide, Highly Religious More Likely to Help Others|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/111013/worldwide-highly-religious-more-likely-help-others.aspx|publisher=Gallup|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study on [[Prosocial behavior|pro-social]] sentiments showed that non-religious people were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people were less inclined when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120430140035.htm Highly Religious People Are Less Motivated by Compassion Than Are Non-Believers] by Science Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura R.

A study by [[Harvard University]] professor [[Robert Putnam]] found that religious people were more charitable than their irreligious counterparts.&lt;ref name="Relgion &amp; Charity"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-05-14-church-community_N.htm|title =Religious citizens more involved -- and more scarce? |publisher = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="better neighbors"&gt;{{cite news | title =Religious people are 'better neighbors'| work = [[USA Today]] | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-11-15-column15_ST_N.htm |accessdate = 2007-10-18|first1=David|last1=Campbell|first2=Robert|last2=Putnam|date=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study revealed that forty percent of [[service of worship|worship service]] attending Americans volunteered regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed to 15% of Americans who never attend services.&lt;ref name="Relgion &amp; Charity"/&gt; Moreover, religious individuals were more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and for health care (21% vs. 13%).&lt;ref name="Relgion &amp; Charity"/&gt; Other research has shown similar correlations between religiosity and giving.&lt;ref name="Brooks Giving"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Arthur|title=Religious Faith and Charitable Giving|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific studies show that the degree of religiosity is generally associated with higher ethical attitudes&lt;ref name="KERLEY, KENT R. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kerley | first1= Kent R. | last2=Matthews | first2= Todd L. | last3= Blanchard | first3 = Troy C. | year= 2005 |title= Religiosity, Religious Participation, and Negative Prison Behaviors | journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 44 | issue=4 | pages= 443–457 | doi =10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00296.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAROGLOU, VASSILIS 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Prosocial Behavior and Religion: New Evidence Based on Projective Measures and Peer Ratings|url=http://researchgate.net/publication/227644145_Prosocial_Behavior_and_Religion_New_Evidence_Based_on_Projective_Measures_and_Peer_Ratings|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=44|issue=3|pages=323–348|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00289.x|last1=Saroglou |first1=Vassilis |last2=Pichon |first2=Isabelle |last3=Trompette |first3=Laurence |last4=Verschueren |first4=Marijke |last5=Dernelle |first5=Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Regnerus, Mark D. 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| year=2006| title=Religious Change and Adolescent Family Dynamics| journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=47|issue=1|pages=175–194 | doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.2006.00042.x|last1=Regnerus |first1=Mark D. |last2=Burdette |first2=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Conroy | first1=S.

The overall relationship between faith and [[crime]] is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found "The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://brewright.com/articles/If%20You%20Love%20Me,%20Keep%20My%20Commandments.pdf|title= "If You Love Me, Keep My Commandments": A Meta-analysis of the Effect of Religion on Crime|last1= Baier|first1= Colin J.|last2= Wright|first2= Bradley R.

A 2005 study by [[Gregory S.

Modern research in [[Relationship between criminology and sociology of education|criminology]] also acknowledges an inverse relationship between religion and crime,&lt;ref&gt;As is stated in: Doris C. Chu (2007). Religiosity and Desistance From Drug Use. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 2007; 34; 661 originally published online Mar 7, 2007; {{doi|10.1177/0093854806293485}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some studies establishing this connection.&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, "religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Baier, C. J.,&amp; Wright, B. R. (2001). "If you love me, keep my commandments":A meta-analysis of the effect of religion on crime. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,38,3–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in his books about the materialism in Americas Evangelical Churches [[Ron Sider]] accuses fellow Christians of failing to do better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Ronald J. Sider, ''The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience: Why Are Christians Living Just Like the Rest of the World?'' (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 2005). Sider quotes extensively from polling research by [[The Barna Group]] showing that moral behavior of evangelical Christians is unexemplary.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Georgia State University]] study published in the academic journal ''Theoretical Criminology'' suggests that religion helps criminals to justify their crimes and might "encourage" it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/03/08/faith_based_prison_programs_new_study_suggests_religion_may_help_criminals.html | title=New Study Suggests Religion May Help Criminals Justify Their Crimes | publisher=www.slate.com | accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research concluded that "many street offenders anticipate an early death, making them less prone to delay gratification, more likely to discount the future costs of crime, and thus more likely to offend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://tcr.sagepub.com/content/17/1/49.short?rss=1&amp;amp%3bssource=mfr | title=With God on my side: The paradoxical relationship between religious belief and criminality among hardcore street offenders |author1=Volkan Topalli |author2=Timothy Brezina |author3=Mindy Bernhardt | journal=Theoretical Criminology |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of religious values ==
Religious values can diverge from commonly-held contemporary moral positions, such as those on [[murder]], mass atrocities, and [[slavery]]. For example, [[Simon Blackburn]] states that "apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Christianity, he states that the "[[Bible]] can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provides examples such as the phrase in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18 that has "helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America": "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," and notes that the [[Old Testament]] God apparently has "no problems with a slave-owning society", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and "is keen on child abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn notes morally suspect themes {{which|date=February 2017}} in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Blackburn|first= Simon|authorlink=Simon Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|pages= 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Hume]] stated that, "The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hume]], "The Natural History of Religion." In {{cite book |title= The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever|last= Hitchens|first= Christopher|year= 2007|publisher= Da Capo Press|location= Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0-306-81608-6|page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said, "There are also, in most religions, specific ethical tenets which do definite harm. The Catholic condemnation of birth control, if it could prevail, would make the mitigation of poverty and the abolition of war impossible. The Hindu beliefs that the cow is a sacred animal and that it is wicked for widows to remarry cause quite needless suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts that &lt;blockquote&gt;You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs....You find as you look around the world that every single bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of war, every step toward better treatment of the colored races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral progress that there has been in the world, has been consistently opposed by the organized churches of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects |edition= |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1957 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. |location= New York |isbn=978-0-671-20323-8 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Paul Copan, Jewish laws in the bible show an evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing forced slavery and identifying slaves as persons and not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Copan |first=Paul |url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/201102/201102_108_slavery.htm.cfm |title=Does the Old Testament Endorse Slavery? An Overview |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bertrand Russell, "Clergymen almost necessarily fail in two ways as teachers of morals. They condemn acts which do no harm and they condone acts which do great harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites an example of a clergyman who was warned by a physician that his wife would die if she had another (her tenth) child, but impregnated her regardless, which resulted in her death. "No one condemned him; he retained his benefice and married again. So long as clergymen continue to condone cruelty and condemn 'innocent' pleasure, they can only do harm as guardians of the morals of the young."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|pages= 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell further states that, "The sense of sin which dominates many children and young people and often lasts on into later life is a misery and a source of distortion that serves no useful purpose of any sort or kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russel allows that religious sentiments have, historically, sometimes led to morally acceptable behavior, but asserts that, "in the present day, [1954] such good as might be done by imputing a theological origin to morals is inextricably bound up with such grave evils that the good becomes insignificant in comparison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Why I Am Not a Christian: And Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects|edition= |last= Russell|first= Bertrand|year= 1957|publisher= George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-671-20323-8|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of secular value frameworks, such as [[consequentialism]],  [[freethought]], [[humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Yet, there have been opposing views about the ability of both religious and secular moral frameworks to provide useful guides to right and wrong actions.

Various non-religious commentators have supported the ability of secular value frameworks to provide useful guides. [[Bernard Williams]] argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&amp;nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Morality|authorlink1=Bernard Williams|last= Williams|first= Bernard|year= 1972|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge|isbn= 0-521-45729-7|pages= 64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers criticize religious morals as incompatible with modern social norms. For example, popular atheist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that we now consider morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Religious aspects of Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The God Delusion]] |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston, New York |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |pages= 262–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Copan, the position of the Bible to slaves is a positive one for the slaves in that Jewish laws imposed a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treated slaves as persons, not property.&lt;ref name="Paul Copan"/&gt;

In a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, [[Romain Rolland]] coined the phrase "'''oceanic feeling'''" to refer to the sensation of being one with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Roberts |first=Robert |editor=[[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, Edward N.]] |title=Emotions in the Christian Tradition |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion-Christian-tradition/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |volume=Winter 2016 |date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Ontology of Religiosity: The Oceanic Feeling and the Value of the Lived Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Freud discusses the feeling in his ''[[The Future of an Illusion|Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FreudS-CIVILIZATION-AND-ITS-DISCONTENTS-text-final.pdf pp. 11–13].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a [[Romain Rolland#Correspondence with Freud|letter to Freud]]:

{{quote|''Mais j'aurais aimé à vous voir faire l'analyse du sentiment religieux spontané ou, plus exactement, de la ''sensation'' religieuse qui est...le fait simple et direct de ''la sensation de l'Eternel'' (qui peut très bien n'être pas éternel, mais simplement sans bornes perceptibles, et comme océanique).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |last=Masson |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Oceanic Feeling.

In strict translation:

{{quote|But I would have liked to see you doing an analysis of ''spontaneous religious sentiment'' or, more exactly, of religious ''feeling'', which is...the simple and direct fact ''of the feeling of the ‘eternal’'' (which can very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and like oceanic, as it were).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William B. |last=Parsons |title=The Enigma of the Oceanic Feeling.

Freud ends ''The Future of an Illusion'' with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of ''Civilization and Its Discontents'', answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.

Freud argues that the "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the preserved "primitive ego-feeling" from infancy.  The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it.  Therefore, the infant has no concept of a "self" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist.  Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the "oceanic feeling" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.

== Neuroscientific explanation ==
{{Main article|Neuroscience of religion}}

"Neurotheology" is a [[neologism]] that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Burton |authorlink=Robert A.

What [[Andrew B.

'''Omnipresence''' or '''ubiquity''' is the property of being present everywhere. The term omnipresence is most often used in a [[religious]] context as an attribute of a [[deity]] or [[God|supreme being]], while the term ubiquity is generally used to describe something "existing or being everywhere at the same time, constantly encountered, widespread, common." Ubiquitous can also be used as a synonym for words like worldwide, universal,  global, pervasive, all over the place. 

The omnipresence of a supreme being is conceived differently by different religious systems. In [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] beliefs like [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] the divine and the universe are separate, but the divine is present everywhere. In [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] beliefs the divine and the universe are identical. In [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] beliefs the divine interpenetrates the universe, but extends beyond it in time and space.

==Introduction==
[[Hinduism]], and other religions that derive from it, incorporate the theory of ''transcendent and immanent omnipresence'' which is the traditional meaning of the word, [[Brahman]]. This theory defines a universal and fundamental substance, which is the source of all physical existence.

Divine omnipresence is thus one of the divine attributes, although in [[Western Christianity]] it has attracted less philosophical attention than such attributes as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or being eternal.

In Western theism, omnipresence is roughly described as the ability to be "present everywhere at the same time",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]: http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/omnipresent&lt;/ref&gt; referring to an unbounded or universal presence. Omnipresence means minimally that there is no place to which God’s knowledge and power do not extend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 9)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-9|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the concept of ubiquity, the ability to be everywhere or in many places at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquity|title=ubiquity |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes unlimited temporal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06612a.htm#IIB |title=Nature and Attributes of God |work= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | publisher=NewAdvent.org |date=September 1, 1909 |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Lane Craig]] states that we shouldn’t think of God as being in space in the sense of being spread out like an invisible ether throughout space. He is not like an invisible gas that is everywhere present in space. This would be incorrect for several reasons. For one, it would mean that if the universe is finite, which is perfectly possible, then God would be finite. We do not want to say that because God is infinite. More seriously, if God is spread out throughout space, like an invisible ether, that means that he is not fully present everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 8)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-8|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=June 2010}} argue that omnipresence is a derived characteristic: an [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]] deity knows everything and can be and act everywhere, simultaneously. Others propound a deity as having the "Three O's", including omnipresence as a unique characteristic of the deity. Most [[Christian denominations]] — following [[theology]] standardized by the [[Nicene Creed]] — explain the concept of omnipresence in the form of the "Trinity", by having a single deity (God) made up of three omnipresent persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

==Omnipresence in religions==
&lt;!--''Comment: It is unclear as to what is meant by "Vedic religion" or labels such as "Indian Vedics." The article seems to claim omnipresence originated in South-east Asia. Possible, but highly unlikely.'' --&gt;
Several ancient cultures such as the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and the [[Native American religion|Native American]] civilizations share similar views on omnipresent nature; the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptians]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Romans]] did not worship an omnipresent being. While most [[Paleolithic]] cultures followed [[Paleolithic religion|polytheistic practices]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, a form of omnipresent deity arises from a worldview that does not share ideas with [[mono-local deity]] cultures. Some omnipresent religions see the whole of [[existence]] as a manifestation of the deity. There are two predominant viewpoints here: [[pantheism]], deity is the summation of Existence; and panentheism, deity is an emergent property of existence. The first is closest to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]' worldview; the latter resembles the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] outlook.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In traditional Jewish monotheism belief of panentheism, or an omnipresent God, is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saadia Gaon]] in his ''HaNivchar BaEmunot U'va-Deot'', II, 11 (English translation of portion free online at end of [https://forthodoxy.org/2015/11/23/parashat-vayetze-yaakov-hamakom-gods-place-or-the-place-of-god/ this post]; Rosenblatt translation [The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, Yale University, 1948], p. 124-125; Arabic/Hebrew Kafih ed. [הנבחר באמונות ובדעות, Jerusalem, 1970] p. 106). Cf. [[Maimonides]]' rejection of panentheism in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Tractate Sanhedrin, 10:1, third principle (English translation by Rosner in ''Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah: Tractate Sanhedrin'' [New York, 1981], p. 151; p. 141 in Kafih's Hebrew edition of the Order of Neziqin with Maimonides' Commentary [Jerusalem, 1963]) and [https://forthodoxy.org/2016/02/03/is-judaism-panentheistic-a-mekori-perspective/ Is Judaism Panentheistic? – A Brief Mekori Perspective].&lt;/ref&gt; While the "entire concept of God occupying physical space, or having any category of spatial reference apply to him was completely rejected by pure Judaic monotheism," [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] teachings, along with certain [[Kabbalistic]] systems, diverged to postulate belief in panentheism.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan, Yehudah B. [https://forthodoxy.org/2015/11/23/parashat-vayetze-yaakov-hamakom-gods-place-or-the-place-of-god/ Parashat Vayetze: HaMakom – God’s Place or the Place of God?] Retrieved 2016-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic beliefs, pantheism is also rejected and omnipresence is described to transcend the physical. According to Shia tradition in [[Nahj al-Balagha]], a compilation of [[Ali]]'s teachings and letters, with commentary by [[Morteza Motahhari]], the only territory that God does not enter is that of nothingness and non-existence. God is with everything, but not in anything, and nothing is with him. God is not within things, though not out of them. He is over and above every kind of condition, state, similarity and likeness.  [[Ali]] says about God's omnipresence: 
* "He is with everything but not in physical nearness.  He is different from everything but not in physical separation." 
* “He  is  not  inside  things  in  the  sense  of  physical  [pervasion  or] penetration  and  is  not  outside  them  in  the  sense  of  [physical]  exclusion [for exclusion entails a kind of finitude].” 
* “He is distinct from things because He overpowers them, and the things are distinct from Him because of their subjection to Him.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duas.org/pdfs/Nahjul-Balagha.pdf pg 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity, as well as in Kabbalistic and Hasidic philosophy, God is omnipresent. However, the major difference between them and other religious systems is that God is still [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] to His [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] and yet [[immanence|immanent]] in relating to creation. God is not immersed in the substance of creation, even though he is able to interact with it as he chooses. He cannot be excluded from any location or object in creation. God's presence is continuous throughout all of creation, though it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to people everywhere. At times, he may be actively present in a situation, while he may not reveal that he is present in another circumstance in some other area. God is omnipresent in a way that he is able to interact with his creation however he chooses, and is the very essence of his creation. While contrary to normal physical intuitions, such omnipresence is logically possible by way of the classic geometric point or its equivalent, in that such a point is, by definition, within all of space without taking up any space. The [[Bible]] states that God can be both present to a person in a manifest manner ([[Psalm]] 46:1, [[Isaiah]] 57:15) as well as being present in every situation in all of creation at any given time (Psalm 33:13-14). Specifically, Oden states that the Bible shows that God can be present in every aspect of human life:

* God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural order, in every level of [[causality]], every fleeting [[Moment (time)|moment]] and momentous event of [[natural history]]...(Psalm 8:3, Isaiah 40:12, [[Nahum]] 1:3)
*God is bodily present in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)]] of his Son, [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] ([[Gospel of John]] 1:14, [[Colossians]] 2:9)
*God is sacredly present and becomes known in special places where God chooses to meet us, places that become set apart by the faithful remembering community ([[1 Corinthians]] 11:23-29) where it may said: "Truly the Lord is in this place" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:16, Matthew 18:20)" &lt;ref&gt;Oden, Thomas C.  ''The Living God''.  ''Systematic Theology'' Vol. 1, 67-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Marbaniang points out that omnipresence doesn't mean divine occupation of all space, nor divine distribution over all space, nor indwelling of every entity, nor that God cannot move in space, nor the divinification of the universe; but means that God is fully present every-where, and that God can do different things at different places at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "Omnipresence", &lt;i&gt;Light of Life&lt;/i&gt;, Mumbai, February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], '''probabilism''' (from [[Latin]] ''probare'', to test, approve) is an ancient Greek doctrine (''πιθανισμός'') of [[academic skepticism]].&lt;ref name="runes2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Runes |first=Dagobert D. |authorlink=Dagobert D. Runes |year=2006 |title=The Dictionary of Philosophy |series=Kessinger Publishing's rare reprints |isbn=978-1-4286-1310-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5g0FOsGwUwC&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;pg=PA251 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that in the absence of certainty, [[probability]] is the best criterion. It can also refer to a 17th-century religious thesis about ethics, or a modern physical-philosophical thesis.

==Philosophy==
In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], probabilism referred to the doctrine which gives assistance in ordinary matters to one who is skeptical in respect of the possibility of real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptics]] of the [[New Academy]] (see [[Academic skepticism]] and [[Carneades]]).

Academic skeptics accept probabilism, while [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|Pyrrhonian skeptics]] do not.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In modern usage, a probabilist is someone who believes that central epistemological issues are best approached using probabilities.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}  This thesis is neutral with respect to whether knowledge entails certainty or whether skepticism about knowledge is true.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Probabilist doctrines continue to be debated in the context of [[artificial general intelligence]], as a counterpoint to the use of [[non-monotonic logic]], as the proper form for [[knowledge representation]] remains unclear.

==Theology==
{{main|Catholic Probabilism}}

In [[Christian ethics|moral theology]], especially [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], it refers especially to the view in [[casuistry]] that in difficult matters of [[conscience]] one may safely follow a doctrine that is [[probability (moral theology)|probable]], for example is approved by a recognized [[Doctor of the Church]], even if the opposite opinion is more probable.

This view was advanced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[theologian]] [[Bartolomé de Medina]] (1527–1581) and defended by many [[Jesuits]] such as [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]] (1528–1581). It was heavily criticised by [[Blaise Pascal]] in his [[Lettres provinciales|''Provincial Letters'']] and by [[St. Alphonsus Ligourí]] in his ''Theologia Moralis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ligourí|first1=Alphonsus, St.|title=Theologia Moralis|date=1852|location=Paris|pages=No. 12, 69.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as leading to moral laxity. Opposed to probabilism is [[probabiliorism]] (Latin ''probabilior'', "more likely"), which holds that when there is a preponderance of evidence on one side of a controversy one is obliged to follow that side, and [[tutiorism]] (Latin ''tutior'', "safer"), which holds that in case of doubt one must take the morally safer side. A more radical view, "minus probabilissimus", holds that an action is permissible if a single opinion allowing that action is available, even if the overwhelming weight of opinion proscribes it.

The doctrine became particularly popular at the start of the 17th century, as it could be used to support almost any position or council any advice.  By mid-century, such thinking, termed [[Laxism]], was recognized as scandalous.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-8018-7109-3}}, "The Scandal of Laxism" p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regunta Yesurathnam''' (16 October 1941 – 8 August 2011)&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;[[Senate of Serampore College (University)]], ''Minutes of the Eighty-sixth meeting of the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]] held on 9 and 10 February 2012 at the New Theological College, [[Dehradun]]'', 2012.  [http://www.senateofseramporecollege.edu.in/docs/senateminutes2012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[priest]] hailing from the [[Diocese of Medak of the Church of South India]], headquartered in [[Medak]], notable as a [[Systematic theology|systematic theologian]]&lt;ref name="Contextualization"&gt;Charles E. Van Engen, ''Five Perspectives of Contextually Appropriate Missional Theology'' in Charles H. Kraft (Edited), ''Appropriate Christianity'', William Carey Library, Pasadena, 2005,
 p.194.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=RysiXCZ7JJgC&amp;pg=PA194]&lt;/ref&gt; who served as Faculty Member from 1974 through 2001 in [[Secunderabad]], [[Telangana]], India, at the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], affiliated to the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]].

Yesurathnam has been acknowledged for his contribution to the disciplines of [[Interfaith dialogue|Dialogical Theology]]&lt;ref name="Sonia"/&gt; and [[Comparative religion]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Swami Raju, ''The Study of Religion: Methods of Perspectives'', BTESSC, SATHRI, Bangalore, 2004, p.54.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VpnXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=r.yesuratnam&amp;dq=r.yesuratnam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio_IW4p-nVAhVKRo8KHXDtAXoQ6AEINTAE]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a pupil of another CSI systematic theologian, [[Joshua Russell Chandran]], under whom he was groomed in the 1960s, Yesurathnam established himself as a scholar and during the subsequent decade, as evidenced by his interest in Dialogical Theology, Yesurathnam seemed to have been influenced by the religious scholars [[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]], of the [[Church of South India]] (CSI), Herbert Jai Singh, of the [[Methodist Church in India]] (MCI)&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Jai Singh, ''The Teaching of Religions in the Indian Context'', ''[[Indian Journal of Theology]]'', Volume 29, Numbers 3 and 4, July–December 1980, pp.149-159.[https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ijt/29-3-4_149.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and David C. Scott, also of the MCI.&lt;ref name="Bob"/&gt;  During the initial years of his doctoral research in the 1970s, it was [[Arvind P. Nirmal]], [[Church of North India|CNI]] (the proponent of [[Dalit theology]]) who supervised and enabled Yesurathnam to push through his doctoral studies.

==Contribution==
===Dialogical theology===
{{Main article|Interfaith dialogue}}
Professor Jutta Sperber, of the [[University of Münster]], Germany, in a work about Dialogical Theology with special reference to the activities of the [[World Council of Churches]] and its unit on Dialogue, has quoted the work of Yesurathnam on the Christian-[[Muslim]] dialogue.  Similarly, Sonia Calza&lt;ref name="Sonia"&gt;Sonia Calza, ''La contemplazione: via privilegiata al dialogo cristiano-induista : Sulle orme di [[Jules Monchanin|J. Monchanin]], [[Henri Le Saux|H. Le Saux]], [[Raimon Panikkar|R. Panikkar]] e [[Bede Griffiths|B. Griffiths]]'', Pauline, Milan, 2001, p.359.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UDa57qubFoIC&amp;lpg=PA165]&lt;/ref&gt; while researching on interfaith dialogue with reference to [[Hinduism]] and Christianity, referred to Yesurathnam's work on Dialogical Theology while writing about the contribution of [[Henri Le Saux]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cornille (Edited), ''The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Inter-Religious Dialogue'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2013.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=UHdgFhRKCOsC&amp;pg=PA1931]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative religion===
{{Main article|Comparative religion}}

Yesurathnam, also wrote on the work on the concept of Avatara, which has been cited by other scholars. Bob Robinson&lt;ref name="Bob"&gt;Bob Robinson, ''Christians Meeting Hindus: An Analysis and Theological Critique of the Hindu-Christian Encounter in India'', Regnum, [[Oxford]], 2004, p.275.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jYsVCItO7tAC&amp;pg=PR4]&lt;/ref&gt; noted this work with special emphasis on the relationship to [[Christianity]] and Steven Tsoukalas quoted Yesurathnam's work on the forms of Avatara.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Tsoukalas, ''Krishna and Christ: Body-divine Relation in the Thought of [[Shiva|Sankara]], [[Ramanuja]] and Classical Christian Orthodoxy'', [[Paternoster Press|Paternoster]], [[Milton Keynes]], 2007, pp.23, 227, 240, 241.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=djIlAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=regunta+yesuratnam&amp;dq=regunta+yesuratnam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGhNCvysXVAhXGMo8KHR9sDPkQ6AEIQzAG]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contextualization===
{{Main article|Contextualization (Bible translation)}}
Inter-disciplinary writings by Yesurathnam have struck new ground in [[inculturation]] as espoused by [[Swamy Amalorananda]] and the [[New Testament]] Scholar [[Suppogu Joseph]], [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches|STBC]] (2007)&lt;ref name="Adaptation"&gt;[http://www.printsasia.it/book/adaptation-of-the-gospel-tradition-in-luke-suppogu-joseph-8184580029-9788184580020 S. Joseph, ''Adaptation of the Gospel Tradition in Luke'', ISPCK, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924081817/http://www.printsasia.it/book/adaptation-of-the-gospel-tradition-in-luke-suppogu-joseph-8184580029-9788184580020 |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had made a sustained research exploring possibilities for the [[Gospel]] to adapt itself to the multi-religious ethos of India.  Earlier proponents who experimented with [[Contextualization (Bible translation)|Contextualization]], emphasizing on the presentation of [[Christ]] adapting to the [[Indian culture]], were [[Robert de Nobili]], [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], [[E. Stanley Jones]], [[Methodist Church in India|MCI]], and [[B. V. Subbamma]], [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church|AELC]], who together were known for their contribution to the [[Christian Ashram Movement]] in India.

Yesurathnam's definition of [[Contextualization (Bible translation)|Contextualization]] has been acknowledged by scholars as a resourceful addition.  Charles E. Van Engen&lt;ref name="Contextualization"/&gt; and Akintunde E. Akinade&lt;ref&gt;Akintunde E. Akinade, ''The Crucible of Faith:  Justice and Liberation in the work of Engelbert Mvent'' in ''Religions - A Scholarly Journal'', Issue 3, 2012, pp.107-116.  [http://www.qscience.com/doi/pdf/10.5339/rels.2012.justice.17]&lt;/ref&gt; refer to the word ''contextualization'' as defined by Yesurathnam.

===Renewal of the Church===
{{Main article|Church renewal}}
Yesurathnam cautioned the Church against falling into traditionalism.  During the Golden Jubilee of the founding of the [[Uniting church]], the CSI held in [[Chennai]] in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;John C. B. Webster, ''The Church of South India Golden Jubilee'' in  ''[[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]]'', Volume 22, Number 2, 1998, pp.50-54.[http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1998-02/1998-02-ibmr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Yesurathnam spoke on the ills befalling the Church in India,
{{quotation|(Adapted) ''The church hierarchy of [[Bishop]]s, [[Presbyter]]s, [[Deacon]]s and [[Laity]] is turning into a [[Varna (Hinduism)|Chaturvarna system]], with the [[Laity]] and [[Women]] as the [[Shudras]], the bottom-most caste.''&lt;ref&gt;R. Yesurathnam, ''Liberation from Jubilee Perspective'' in ''South India Churchman'', July 1997, pp.7-8.[http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1998-02/1998-02-ibmr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fv|date=May 2018}}}}  Echoing the apprehensions by Yesurathnam, [[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]] who was also present at the Jubilee in [[Chennai]], pointed out that one must first introspect before raising [[cudgels]] against the [[Indian caste system]] and believed that one failed to notice the gradual transformation of the [[episcopacy]] into such a system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]], "Vision and Reality: Reflections on the Church of South India" in ''[[People's Reporter]]'', 1–15 September 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yesurathnam, in an introduction to the book ''Jesus' Tears!'' by Elizabeth Thelma Johnson (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Thelma Johnson, ''Jesus' Tears!'', ISPCK, New Delhi, 2007, p.xv.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nlbUf3gPPl0C&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=r.yesuratnam&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted the work of a [[Laity]] and appreciated their contribution towards the [[Christian missions]].

==Studies==
From his youth, Yesurathnam was inspired by the work of the [[Roman Catholic missionaries|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant missionary|Protestant]] [[Christian mission]]s in Telangana. He entered the ministry of the [[Catholic Church]] through the [[Diocese of Medak]], becoming a ministerial candidate during the bishopric of [[Frank Whittaker]], the first Bishop-in-Medak. He studied at a [[seminary]] in [[Bangalore]] for spiritual formation and was ordained in 1967 by [[Bishop]] [[Eber Priestley]], the then Bishop-in-Medak.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Graduate===
After initial schooling at the mission schools founded by the [[English Wesleyan Mission|Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society]] (WMMS) in Telangana, Yesurathnam decided to take up [[priesthood]]. Bishops [[Frank Whittaker]] and [[Eber Priestley]], successively, became his Spiritual Confessors and led him to take up spiritual studies at the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] during 1963-1967.&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; He was awarded a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B. D.]] degree.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Postgraduate===
{{Main article|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin}}
In 1969, Yesurathnam was recalled from parish work and sent to the Protestant Regional Theologiate in [[Bangalore]] for further spiritual studies that lasted until 1972 and resulted in the award of a [[Master of Theology]] degree after research under [[Joshua Russell Chandran]] of the CSI.&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt;

===Doctoral===
{{Main article|Henri Le Saux}}
[[File:Swami Abhishiktananda.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Henri Le Saux]], [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] (1910-1973) ([[Swami Abhishiktananda]]);  Yesurathnam researched during 1978-1982 on [[Benedictine monk|Benedictine monk's]] experiences of [[spirituality]] as found in [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]]]]
After a five-year teaching ministry that began in 1974&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; at the Andhra Christian Theological College, Secunderabad, Yesurathnam qualified to undertake doctoral level research in 1978&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; and was granted a five-year study leave.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;R. Yesurathnam, ''Religious Pluralism: Some Implications for the Mission of the Church'' in [[H. S. Wilson]] (Edited),  ''The Church on the Move: A Quest to Affirm the Biblical Faith'', Christian Literature Society, Chennai, 1988.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=S-wrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=h.+s.+wilson+victor+premasagar&amp;dq=h.+s.+wilson+victor+premasagar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF3fKC7NnVAhVMrY8KHVgyCyMQ6AEIJzAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Yesurathnam's Bishop during that period, [[B. G. Prasada Rao]], made efforts to ensure that Yesurathnam was able to join his ''[[alma mater]]'', the United Theological College, Bangalore, where he was able to take up research in the discipline of systematic theology under the guidance of Arvind P. Nirmal, [[Church of North India|CNI]].  Yesurathnam also came under the tutelage of [[Stanley Jedidiah Samartha]], a leading authority on Dialogical Theology.&lt;ref name="Hans"&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Theology in a Global Context: The Last Two Hundred Years'', William B. Eerdmans, [[Grand Rapids]], 2005. pp.523-526. [https://books.google.com/books?id=gtkvQxB-6lsC&amp;pg=PA524]&lt;/ref&gt;  During the research period between 1978-1982,&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; Yesurathnam was also sent to the [[University of Birmingham]], England, in 1979 for a two-year research exposure through the efforts of Gordon Shaw&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; who ensured his overseas travel and stay in England at Kingsmead College under the [[Selly Oak Colleges]], where he was supervised by [[Walter Jacob Hollenweger]], a leading authority on [[Pentecostalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Jacob Hollenweger]], ''My Pilgrimage in Mission'', ''[[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]]'', Volume 29, Number 2, 2005, p. 85-88.[http://www.wjhollenweger.ch/files/2005-02-085-hollenweger-my-pilgrimage-in-mission.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1981, Yesurathnam returned to the United Theological College and began shaping his doctoral dissertation under the guidance of David C. Scott and by 1982, he rejoined the Andhra Christian Theological College, which by then was being led by the [[New Testament]] scholar,&lt;ref&gt;David Komaravalli, ''Divine Operation and Human Response: A Comparison Between [[Rudolf Bultmann]]'s Understanding of the Pauline Perspectives and Certain Elements in Recent Indian Thought'', [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Edinburgh]], 1973.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Iq8UMwEACAAJ&amp;dq=komaravalli+david&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3abo_f_VAhXMvY8KHTj8AoEQ6AEIJzAA]&lt;/ref&gt; K. David, [[CBCNC]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Mar Aprem Mooken]], ''Indian Christian who is who'', Bombay Parish Church of the East, Bombay, 1983, p.106.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=u2s5AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=komaravalli+david&amp;dq=komaravalli+david&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3abo_f_VAhXMvY8KHTj8AoEQ6AEIMDAC]&lt;/ref&gt; and took up his teaching role in systematic theology, but was able to submit his doctoral thesis to the university through his supervisor at the United Theological College and finally in 1987, much before nearing a decade of registering with the university, it awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Theology]].&lt;ref name="DTH"&gt;Senate of Serampore College, ''List of the Recipient of the Degree of Doctor of Theology''.  [http://www.senateofseramporecollege.edu.in/hall-of-fame/doctor-of-theology/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Yesurathnam sought permission from the Senate of Serampore College to publish his doctoral work nearly two decades later, in 2006.&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; His thesis was already being referred by research scholars&lt;ref&gt;Antony Kalliath, ''The Word in the Cave: The Experiential Journey of Swami Abhishiktānanda to the Point of Hindu-Christian Meeting'', Intercultural Publications, New Delhi, 1996, p.436.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tgPkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=antony+kalliath+dialogical+theology&amp;dq=antony+kalliath+dialogical+theology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLnIur8f_VAhUBOY8KHXaEBUkQ6AEILDAB]&lt;/ref&gt; on works relating to the contribution of [[Swami Abhishiktananda]].

==Ministry==

===Pastoral ministry===
[[File:Medakcathedralsideview.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Church of South India|CSI]]-Medak Cathedral,[[Medak]] where Yesurathnam was ordained in 1967 by Bishop [[Eber Priestley]], [[Diocese of Medak|Bishop - in - Medak]].]]
{{Main article|Diocese of Medak of the Church of South India}}
Yesurathnam was ordained in 1967 by Priestley, then Bishop-in-Medak, and was assigned ministerial functions in the parishes falling under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak and served in [[Sangareddy]]&lt;ref name="Hope"/&gt; and other towns shepherding congregations for nearly a decade&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; until he was recalled in 1974 by then Bishop, [[H. D. L. Abraham]], and reassigned the role of a Spiritual Formator.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1992, when [[Victor Premasagar]] vacated the bishopric of Medak on attaining superannuation, the ensuing [[Sede vacante]] was contested among whom Yesurathnam stood in the fray for the vacant bishopric, which was overseen by [[Ryder Devapriam]], then Moderator of the [[Church of South India Synod]] and a former colleague of Yesurathnam at the Protestant Regional Theologiate.  However, the sudden death of Devapriam on 4 September 1992&lt;ref name="Nandyal"&gt;[http://dioceseofnandyal.org/ Diocese of Nandyal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106141716/http://dioceseofnandyal.org/ |date=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Council of Churches Review]]'', Volume 112, 1992, p.774.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MgnZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ryder+devapriam+germany&amp;dq=ryder+devapriam+germany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixraOg4eHXAhWBv48KHfPuDxgQ6AEIJTAA]&lt;/ref&gt; turned the tides for those in fray, resulting in the appointment and subsequent consecration of [[B. P. Sugandhar]].

===Teaching===

The Andhra Christian Theological College (ACTC) relocated from [[Rajahmundry]] to Secunderabad. Yesurathnam was invited to join the college in 1974,&lt;ref name="Punthi"/&gt; during the Principalship of [[Victor Premasagar]].&lt;ref name="Carder"&gt;William Gordon Carder, ''On theological education in [[Andhra Pradesh]] of the [[Canadian Baptist Mission]] [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]] 1880-1975'' in ''Indian Church History Review'', Volume 13, Issue 1, 1979, pp.70-84.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wsTYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Christian+Ministerial+Training+in+the+Convention+of+Baptist+Churches+of+Northern+Circars+from+1882+to+1971&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=jeremiah]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 he was appointed guest professor at the [[Kirchliche Hochschule Wuppertal/Bethel]] in Germany,&lt;ref name="Matthias"&gt;Matthias Freudenberg, ''Anniversary letter to [[Jürgen Fangmeier]]'', 2011, p.6.[http://www.reformiert-info.de/daten/File/Upload/doc-10788-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; where he taught until 1994.{{cn|date=May 2018}} He then returned to ACTC and was appointed principal under the institution's policy of rotating that office between the various constituent churches in four-year cycles.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Yesurathnam took a year's sabbatical leave in 1998 to the Overseas Ministries Study Center,&lt;ref name="IBMR"/&gt; [[New Haven, Connecticut]] to continue his research pursuits&lt;ref name="IBMR1"&gt;R. Yesurathnam, ''Book Review: Relevant Patterns of Christian Witness in India: People as Agents of Mission'', [[International Bulletin of Missionary Research]], Volume 25, Issue 88, 2001.  [http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/2004-04/2004-04-191-index.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and rejoined the Theologiate in Secunderabad to teach for two more years until 2001.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Missionary service===
When the [[Council for World Mission]] (CWM) sought missionaries from the CSI, Yesurathnam moved to the [[International University of the Caribbean]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]], where he began his sojourn in the [[New millennium]] and served as a theological educator for nearly a decade&lt;ref&gt;[[Council for World Mission]] Annual Review 2009'', ''Missionaries serving with CWM, 2009, pp. 18, 23.[http://www.cwmission.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AnnualReport2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; until his death on 8 August 2011&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; at the [[Yashoda Hospitals]], [[Hyderabad]].

==Writings==
Yesurathnam's works are available in nearly 35 [[research institute]]s, comprising seminaries, [[State university (India)|state universities]] and research academies across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America.&lt;ref name="WC"&gt;[[WorldCat]] search on "Regunta Yesurathnam".[https://www.worldcat.org/title/christian-dialogical-theology-the-contribution-of-swami-abhishiktananda/oclc/607753147&amp;referer=brief_results]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
The [[Sangam period]] in [[Tamilakam]] (c. 500 BCE to 300 CE) was characterized by the coexistence of many religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] alongside the [[ethnic religion]]s of the [[Tamil people]].

==Tamil religions==
Tamil religions denotes the religious traditions and practices of Tamil-speaking people. The Tamils are native to modern state of India known as [[Tamil Nadu]] and the northern and eastern part of [[Sri Lanka]]. Tamils lives also outside their native boundaries due to migration such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Réunion]], [[Myanmar]], [[Mauritius]] and in countries in [[Europe]]. Many emigrant Tamils retain elements of a cultural, linguistic, and religious tradition that predates the Christian era.

===Early Tamil religion===
A Neolithic cattle-herding culture existed in [[South India]] several millennia prior to the Christian era. By the first century, a relatively well-developed civilization had emerged. It is described in some detail in Tamil texts such as the [[Tholkappiyam]] (third BCE) and by the Sankam poets—an "academy" of poets who wrote in the first two centuries of the Common Era.

Ancient Tamil grammatical works [[Tholkappiyam]], the ten anthologies [[Pathuppāṭṭu]], the eight anthologies [[Eṭṭuttokai]] sheds light on early religion of ancient Tamil people. [[Murugan]] was glorified as, ''the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,'' as ''the favored god of the Tamils.''&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"&gt;Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiva]] was also seen as the supreme God.&lt;ref name="Kanchan Sinha 1979"/&gt; Early iconography of [[Murugan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery|year=2006|publisher=harappa.com|url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904034700/http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shiva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E.

Simoons| year = 1998| page = 363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangam landscape]] was classified into five categories, ''thinais'', based on the mood, the season and the land. [[Tolkappiyam]], mentions that each of these ''thinai'' had an associated deity such [[Murugan]] in ''Kurinji''-the hills, [[Thirumal]] in ''Mullai''-the forests, [[Kotravai|Kaali]] in ''Pālai''-the deserts, [[Indra]] in ''Marutham''-the plains and [[Varuna]] in ''Neithal''-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] who were all assimilated into Sangam religion over time. Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed to [[Dravidian languages]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}} This represents an early religious and cultural fusion{{sfn|Lockard|2007|p=50}}{{refn|name=Lockard|Lockard: "The encounters that resulted from Aryan migration brought together several very different peoples and cultures, reconfiguring Indian society.

The cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiruchandran|first=Selvy|title=Ideology, caste, class, and gender|year=1997|publisher=Vikas Pub.

===Veriyattam===
"Veriyattam" refers to [[spirit possession]] of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=Srinivasa|title=History of the Tamils: from the earliest times to 600 A.D.|year=1929|publisher=Asian Educational Services|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers.

===Nadukkal===
Among the early Tamils the practice of erecting [[hero stone]]s (''nadukkal'') had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shashi|first=S. S.|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh: Volume 100|year=1996|publisher=Anmol Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Subramanium|first=N.|title=Śaṅgam polity: the administration and social life of the Śaṅgam Tamils|year=1980|publisher=Ennes Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theyyam===

[[Theyyam]] is a ritual shaman dance popular in [[Kerala]] and parts of Tamil Nadu and [[Karnataka]]. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors,  is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains.

The early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence—a growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners.

The layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male [[Village deities of Tamil Nadu|guardian deity]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic= காவல் கடவுள்|trans=kāval kaṭavuḷ}}) has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 14|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divinity of kings==

===Pre-Sangam and Sangam age===
Throughout Tamil Nadu, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=William P.|title=The sacred marriage of a Hindu goddess|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King was 'the representative of God on earth' and lived in a ''koyil'', which means the "residence of God". The Modern Tamil word for temple is [[koil]] ({{lang-ta|கோயில்}}). Titular worship was also given to Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anand|first=Mulk Raj|title=Splendours of Tamil Nadu |year=1980|publisher=Marg Publications|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;noj=1&amp;prmdo=1&amp;biw=1067&amp;bih=565&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Koyil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;oq=The+king+is+%27the+representative+of+God+on+earth%27+and+lives+in+a+palace+called+%27+Kovil%27%2C+which+means+the+residence+of+God.+The+ritual+worship+of+God&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3...0.0.0.8227.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0.DdIt9d1ZNjo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Pran Nath|title=History of South India|year=1979|publisher=S.

Words meaning 'King', like ''kō'' ({{lang-ta|கோ}} "King"), ''iṟai'' ({{lang|ta|இறை}} "Emperor") and ''āṇḍavan'' ({{lang|ta|ஆண்டவன்}} "Conqueror") now primarily refer to Gods.

[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Murugan]] temple at Salavanakuppam near [[Mahabalipuram]]]]

The brick temple excavated in 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/21/stories/2005092104692000.htm&lt;/ref&gt; dates to the [[Sangam period]] and is believed to be the oldest Hindu temple to be found in Tamil Nadu. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples which face either east or west and is believed to have been constructed even before ''shilpa shastras'' were written

[[File:Skanda, from Kannuaj.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|Sculpture of the god Murugan]]
During the Sangam period, [[Shiva]], [[Murugan]], [[Thirumal]] and Kotravai were some of the popular [[deity|deities]]. The poetic division of the landscape into [[Sangam landscape#Poetic Attributes of the Landscapes|five regions]] also associated each region with its own patron deity.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=381}}
The people of the pastoral lands or the [[Sangam landscape#Mullai .E2.80.93 Forests|Mullai]] regions worshipped [[Thirumal]]. The [[Sangam landscape#Marutham .E2.80.93 Cropland|Marutham]] people worshipped [[Indra]] or ''Ventan'', while the [[Sangam landscape#Neithal .E2.80.93 Seashore|Neithal]] people considered [[Varuna]]n or ''Katalon'' to be their patron deity and the [[Sangam landscape#Paalai .E2.80.93 Wastelands|Palai]] people worshipped [[Korravai]] or [[Kali]]. Other popular deities of this age were [[Kama]] the god of love, [[Surya]] the sun, [[Chandra]] the moon and [[Yama]] the god of death. The [[Brahmin]]s of the Tamil country attached great importance to the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Priests learned in the Vedic rites typically performed them under the patronage of the kings.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=231}}

The temples of the Sangam age were built out of perishable materials such as plaster, timber and brick, which is why little trace of them is found today.{{sfn|Subrahmanian|1972|p=382}} The only public structures of any historical importance belonging to this age that have survived to this day are the rock-beds hewn out of natural rock formation, that were made for the ascetics. The ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' and the Sangam poems such as ''[[Kaliththokai]]'', ''[[Mullaippāṭṭu]]'' and ''[[Purananuru]]'' mention several kinds of temples such as the ''Puranilaikkottam'' or the temple at the outskirts of a city, the ''Netunilaikkottam'' or the tall temple, the ''Palkunrakkottam'' the temple on top of a hill, the ''Ilavantikaippalli'' or the temple with a garden and bathing ghat, the ''Elunilaimatam'' or a seven storeyed temple, the ''Katavutkatinakar'' or the temple city.{{sfn|Gopalakrishnan|2005|p=19}}

Some of the popular festivals of this age were [[Karthikai Deepam|Karthigaideepam]], Tiruvonam, Kaman vizha and Indira vizha. Karthigaideepam was otherwise known as Peruvizha and was celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai every year. The Kaaman vizha was held in the spring and during this festival, men and women dressed up well and participated in dancing. Indravizha included the performance of Vedic sacrifices, prayers to various gods, musical recitals and dancing.{{sfn|Balambal|1998|p=6}}

==Jainism==
{{Main article|Tamil Jain}}
The exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the [[Sangam period]]. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), [[Tolkāppiyam]], was a Jain.&lt;ref name=Encyclopaedia&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Singh  | first = Narendra   | title = Encyclopaedia of Jainism  | publisher = Anmol Publications  | year = 2001  | pages = 3144  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pHZwgrLlOkUC&amp;dq  | isbn = 978-81-261-0691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the 2nd century BCE. They are regarded to be associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.&lt;ref&gt;Early Tamil epigraphy from the earliest times to the sixth century A.D. Iravatham Mahadevan, Harvard University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=595&amp;cat=42 Recent Discoveries of Jaina Cave Inscriptions in Tamilnadu by Iravatham Mahadevan&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars consider the [[Tirukkural]] by [[Valluvar]] to be the work by a Jain.&lt;ref&gt;Tirukkural, Vol. 1,  S.M. Diaz, Ramanatha Adigalar Foundation, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiruvalluvar and his Tirukkural, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kural, P. S. Sundaram, Penguin Classics, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It emphatically supports vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than a thousand offerings in fire (verse 259).

[[Silappatikaram]], a major work in Tamil literature, was written by a Camaṇa, [[Ilango Adigal]]. It describes the historical events of its time and also of the then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and [[Shaivism]]. The main characters of this work, [[Kannagi]] and [[Kovalan]], who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.

According to [[George L. Hart]], the legend of the [[Tamil Sangams]] or "literary assemblies: was based on the Jain ''sangham'' at [[Madurai]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend."&lt;ref&gt;The Milieu of the Ancient Tamil Poems, Prof. George Hart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jainism began to decline around the 8th century, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially [[Shaivism]]. Still, the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Pandya Dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties embraced Jainism.

==Buddhism==
{{Main article|Tamil Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.6|Footprint of Buddha engraved on stone, c. 1st century CE]]

The [[Buddhist]]s worshiped the impressions of [[Buddha]]’s feet engraved on stone and platforms made of stone that represented his seat. The pious Buddhist walked round them, with his right side towards them and bowed his head as a token of reverence.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=232}} The [[Cilapatikaram|Silapatikaram]] mentions that the [[monk]]s worshipped Buddha by praising him as the wise, holy and virtuous teacher who adhered to his vows strictly, as the one who subdued anger and all evil passions and as the refuge of all mankind. [[Manimekalai]] is a sequel to the Silapathikaram, which tellst the story of [[Buddhism]] of the daughter of [[Kovalan]] and [[Madhavi (Silappatikaram)|Madhavi]].

In the Buddhist [[Viharas]] or monasteries, learned monks preached their sermons, seated in a place which was entirely concealed from the view of the audience. The Buddhists did not observe the distinctions of caste and invited all ranks to assemble on a footing of equality. Self-control, wisdom and charity were among the virtues preached and practiced by the monks, who were numerous in the ancient Tamil country.{{sfn|Kanakasabhai|1904|p=233}}

The still-functioning [[Paradesi Synagogue|synagogue in Mattancherry]] belongs to the [[Paradesi Jews]], the descendants of [[Sephardim]] that were expelled from Spain in [[Spanish Inquisition|1492]].&lt;ref name="TheShengold" /&gt;

==Philosophies of religion==

===Secularism===
The secular identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Tamil Literature: Introductory articles|year=1990|publisher=Institute of Asian Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[Sangam literature]] is often celebrated to represent the tolerance among [[Tamil people]]. Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai, concludes in his ''History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piḷḷai|first=Es Vaiyāpurip|title=History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.|year=1956|publisher=New Century Book House}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cquote|&lt;center&gt;Thus the Tamil land became a fertile nursery and the several religions... throve in friendly rivalry.|author= Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai|source= ''History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.''&lt;center&gt;}} Most scholars agree that the lack of 'god' should not be inferred to be atheistic. The [[Tamil books of Law]], particularly the [[Tirukkural]], is considered as the [[Perennial philosophy]] of [[Tamil culture]] because of its universalisability.

===Ūzh and Vinai===
Ūzh meaning 'fate' or 'destiny'  and vinai meaning 'works' concerns the ancient [[Tamil people|Tamil]] belief of differentiating what man can do and what is destined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Tamil studies, Issues 31–32|year=1987|publisher=International Association of Tamil Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaṭavuḷ and Iyavuḷ===
Sangam [[Tamil people]] understood two distinct characteristics of Godhood. [[Transcendence (religion)|God who is beyond all]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=கடவுள்|trans=Kaṭavuḷ}}) and the [[Primum movens|God who sets things in motion]] ({{indic|lang=ta|indic=இயவுள்|trans=Iyavuḷ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singam|first=S.

===Protestantism===
[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], a [[Presbyterian]], performed a [[Eucharist|communion]] service for himself using a kit provided by his church. Aldrin had told flight director [[Chris Kraft]] of his plans and intended to broadcast the service back to Earth but opted not to at the request of [[Deke Slayton]], due to the continuing controversy over Apollo 8's reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Communion in Space|date=October 1970|publisher=Guideposts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A microfilm [[Bible]] that had been to the surface of the Moon was auctioned off in 2011.&lt;ref name=nicola&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/news/nasas-first-bible-on-the-moon-to-be-auctioned-off-54968/ Nicola Menzie - '''NASA's First Bible on the Moon to Be Auctioned Off''' (2011) - Christian Post Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[King James Version]] created after three astronauts lost their lives in the [[Apollo 1]] fire.&lt;ref name=nicola/&gt; [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], one of the astronauts who perished, had wanted to take a Bible to the Moon.&lt;ref name=nicola/&gt;

===Roman Catholicism===
A signed message from [[Pope Paul VI]] was included among statements from dozens of other world leaders left on the moon on a silicon disk during the [[Apollo 11]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following the mission [[William Donald Borders]], Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando]], told the Pope that the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]] placed the moon within his diocese, as the first explorers had departed from Cape Kennedy which was under his jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orlandodiocese.org/fno-diocesan-news/13768-remembering-the-bishop-of-the-moon&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] of the Catholic Church talked to the crew of the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] while it was in Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=thom&gt;[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/07/the-surprising-history-of-prayer-in-space/ Thom Patterson - The surprising history of prayer in space (2011)- CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Orthodoxy===
Russian Orthodox Christmas was celebrated on the [[International Space Station]], on January 7, 2011.&lt;ref name=russianchristmas&gt;[http://www.space.com/9719-christmas-russians-space.html Tariq Malik - '''Christmas Comes Twice for Russians in Space''' (07 January 2011) - SPACE.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cosmonauts had the day off, but one of the other crew [[Twitter|tweeted]], "Merry Christmas to all Russia."&lt;ref name=russianchristmas/&gt; The whole crew also celebrated on December 25, two weeks prior.&lt;ref name=russianchristmas/&gt;

==Islam==
Muslims in space struggle with fulfilling their religious obligations including kneeling and facing Mecca to pray in microgravity traveling at several kilometres per second. The issue first came up when [[Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], a [[House of Saud|Saudi]] prince, flew aboard [[STS-51-G]] and again when [[Anousheh Ansari]] flew as a tourist to the [[International space station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1010/p16s02-stss.html|title=How does an Islamic astronaut face Mecca in orbit?|last=Gartner|first=Bettina |date=October 10, 2007|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for Malaysian  [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]]'s trip to the ISS in 2007, the [[National Fatwa Council]] created  "Muslim Obligations in the International Space Station" outlining permissible modifications to rituals such as kneeling when praying (not required in space), facing Mecca when praying (left to the astronaut's best abilities at the start of prayer), and washing (a wet towel will suffice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20894077/|title=Astronaut to grapple with daily prayer ritual|date=September 20, 2007|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE){{clarify |date=August 2017 |reason=no country specified }} issued a [[fatwa]] forbidding devout Muslims from participating as crew members in [[Mars One]]'s proposed one way mission to [[Mars]]. Speaking for the clerical group, Farooq Hamada explained that, "Protecting life against all possible dangers and keeping it safe is an issue agreed upon by all religions and is clearly stipulated in verse 4/29 of the Holy Quran: Do not kill yourselves or one another. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/22/muslim_clerics_issue_fatwa_banning_the_devout_from_mars_one_suicide_mission/|title=Muslim clerics issue fatwa banning the devout from Mars One 'suicide' mission|date=February 22, 2014|publisher=The A Register|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
An example of Judaism in space occurred in 2003, when a [[Microform|microfilm]] [[Torah]] and a written copy of the [[Kiddush|Shabbat kiddush]] were brought into orbit by [[Ilan Ramon]].&lt;ref name=thom/&gt;

[[Theologians]] however have questioned the utility of an approach to religion by way of a so-called instinct;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Berkhof, ''Systematic Theology'' (1996) p. 111-2&lt;/ref&gt;[[psychologists]] have disputed the existence of any such specific [[instinct]];&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Pratt, ''The Religious Consciousness'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  while others would point to the advance of [[secularization]] in the modern world as refuting the assumption of a specific religious instinct inevitably leading to the establishment of religion as a fundamental human institution.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
{{main|Paleolithic religion}}
There are no religious [[ritual]]s observed in animals, including our close relatives, chimpanzees and other apes, although chimps were observed to have sometimes collective excitements for no reason.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/Alcorta_Sosis,_Signals_and_rituals_of_humans_and_animals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologists have established the existence of [[Funeral|burial rituals]] among [[Neanderthal]]s some 50,000 years ago:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDHsE_Efy0EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=NEANderthal+religious+rituals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tiAUESD11q&amp;sig=Wc-0NamAlVujLYC6fwaxW9ku6ZM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZFu4TMDmHMP38AaX8I3DDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Prayer: A History| authors=Philip Zaleski, Carol Zaleski| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-618-77360-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their appearance has sometimes been taken as evidence of the human capacity to ''transform'' instinct, rather than to be driven by it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and Jung==
[[Sigmund Freud]] saw human weakness and helplessness as a fundamental force behind the establishment of religion&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; - a view which might seem to draw support from the [[World Values Survey|Inglehart-Welzel]] thesis that links the insecurities of traditional economies to a search for spiritual certainty, the affluence of modernisation to a declining stress on religion.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Foster, ''Luck of the Irish'' (2008) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) theorized the existence of a [[collective unconscious]], as a residue of what has been learned in humankind's evolution and ancestral past, which contains the instinctual potential for [[creativity]] as well as the spiritual heritage of mankind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22596676/Jung-and-Religion-The-Opposing-Self| title=Jung and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which unconsciously dictates our behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locke |first=John |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780892540495 |title=Jung's Thoughts on God: The Religious Depths of Our Psyches (Jung on the Hudson Book Series) by Donald Dyer - Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date=2010-10-02 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he recognized in man a genetic predisposition to order experience in mythological, religious or symbolic terms,&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Jung reserved judgement as to what bearing this had for the truth-value of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 75-82&lt;/ref&gt; 

He never ceased however to stress the important challenge all such factors presented to any shallowly rationalistic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p.90-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Durkheim]] saw the social, not the instinctual side of mankind as the key to their religious experience.&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Religious intolerance''' is [[Toleration|intolerance]] against another's religious beliefs or practices or lack thereof.

==Definition==
The mere statement on the part of a religion that its own beliefs and practices are correct and any contrary beliefs are incorrect does not in itself constitute intolerance (i.e., ideological intolerance).

Religious intolerance, rather, is when a group (e.g., a society, religious group, non-religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate practices, persons or beliefs  on religious grounds.

==Historical perspectives==
The modern concept of intolerance developed out of the religious controversies between Protestants and Catholics in 17th- and 18th-century England. The doctrine of 'religious toleration' at this time, sought to eradicate religious sentiments and dogmas from the political demesne.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobolt|first=Sara B.|authorlink=Sara Hobolt|last2=Brug|first2=Wouter Van der|last3=Vreese|first3=Claes H. De|last4=Boomgaarden|first4=Hajo G.|last5=Hinrichsen|first5=Malte C.|date=2011-09-01|title=Religious intolerance and Euroscepticism|url=http://eup.sagepub.com/content/12/3/359|journal=European Union Politics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=359–79|doi=10.1177/1465116511404620|issn=1465-1165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 19th century British historian [[Arnold Toynbee]], for a religious establishment to persecute another religion for being "wrong" ironically puts the persecuting religion in the wrong, undermining its own legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toynbee|first=Arnold|title=A Study of History: Abridgment of Volumes I–VI|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-19-505081-9|editor=Dorothea Grace Somervell|page=300|chapter=Failure of Self-Determination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[constitution]]s of some countries contain provisions expressly forbidding the state from engaging in certain acts of religious intolerance or preference within its own borders, examples of such include the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States]] [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the Article 4 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of [[Germany]], Article 44.2.1 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] of [[The Republic of Ireland]], Article 40 of the [[Estonia]]n Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/en00000_.html ''"Estonia - Constitution"''], ICL Document 28 June 1992, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 24 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution]] of [[Turkey]], Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution]] of the [[People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html|title=Constitution of the People's Republic of China|website=en.people.cn|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 3 Section 5 of the [[1987 Constitution|Constitution of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/8-philippineconstitutions/70-1987-constitution.html 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines], [http://thecorpusjuris.com CorpusJuris], retrieved 24 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states, whilst not containing constitutional provisions directly related to religion, nonetheless contain provisions forbidding discrimination on religious grounds (see, for example, Article 1 of the [[France|French]] [[Constitution of France|Constitution]], article 15 of Canada's [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and article 40 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|Constitution]] of Egypt). These constitutional provisions do not necessarily guarantee that all elements of the state remain free from religious intolerance at all times, and practice can vary widely from country to country.

Other countries, meanwhile, may allow for religious preference, for instance through the establishment of one or more [[state religion]]s, but not for religious intolerance. [[Finland]], for example, has the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] as its official state religions, yet upholds the right of free expression of religion in article 11 of its [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]].

Some countries retain laws forbidding [[defamation]] of religious belief. Some retain laws forbidding all forms of [[blasphemy]] (e.g., [[Germany]] where, in 2006, [[Manfred van H.]] was convicted of blasphemy against [[Islam]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/Suspended-prison-for-German-who-insulted-Koran_135903.html|title=Suspended prison for German who insulted Koran|website=www.expatica.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by some as official endorsement of religious intolerance, amounting to the criminalization of religious views. The connection between intolerance and blasphemy laws is closest when the laws apply to only one religion. In [[Pakistan]] blasphemy directed against either the tenets of the [[Qur'an]] or the Prophet [[Mohammed]] is punishable by either life imprisonment or death. [[Apostasy]], the rejection of one's old religion, is also criminalized in a number of countries, notably [[Afghanistan]] with [[Abdul Rahman (convert)|Abdul Rahman]] being the first to face the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for converting to [[Christianity]].

The [[United Nations]] upholds the right to free expression of religious belief in articles and 18 and 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] while article 2 forbids [[discrimination]] on the basis of religion. Article 18 also allows for the freedom to change religion. The Declaration is not legally binding, however the United States chose in 1998 to pass the International Religious Freedom Act, creating the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|Commission on International Religious Freedom]], and mandating that the United States government take action against any country found to violate the religious freedoms outlined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/intlrel.htm "International Religious Freedom Act of 1998"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608190937/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/intlrel.htm |date=2007-06-08 }}, 27 January 1998, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Council in 2011 adopted Resolution 16/18 on "Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief"&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A.HRC.RES.16.18_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was hailed by stakeholders from all regions and faiths as a turning point in international efforts to confront religious intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = URG Policy Report: Combatting global religious intolerance|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/combatting-global-religious-intolerance-the-implementation-of-human-rights-council-resolution-1618/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is legally binding on all [[European Union]] states (following the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), makes restricting the rights of an individual to practice or change their religion illegal in article 9, and discrimination on the basis of religion illegal in article 14.

In its 2000 annual report on international religious freedom, the U.S. [[State Department]] cited China, [[Myanmar]], Iran, Iraq and [[Sudan]] for persecuting people for their religious faith and practices.  The report, which covers July 1999 through June 2000, details U.S. policy toward countries where religious freedom is violated in the view of the U.S. State Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/mediaroom/press/2000.html "United States Commission on International Freedom of Religion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103150009/http://uscirf.gov/mediaroom/press/2000.html |date=2005-11-03 }}, Press Releases 2000, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[advocacy group]] [[Freedom House]] produced a report entitled "Religious Freedom in the World" in 2000 which ranked countries according to their religious freedom. The countries receiving a score of 7, indicating those where religious freedom was least respected, were [[Turkmenistan]], Iran, Saudi Arabia, [[Sudan]], [[Myanmar]] and [[North Korea]]. China was given a score of 6 overall, however [[Tibet]] was listed separately in the 7 category. Those countries receiving a score of 1, indicating the highest level of religious freedom, were [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2000|title=Freedom in the World 2000 {{!}} Freedom House|website=freedomhouse.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within those countries that openly advocate religious tolerance there remain debates as to the limits of tolerance. Some individuals and religious groups, for example, retain beliefs or practices which involve acts contrary to established law, such as the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by members of the [[Rastafari movement]], the religious use of eagle feathers by non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (contrary to the [[eagle feather law]], 50 CFR 22), or the practice of [[polygamy]] amongst the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1 "Official Declaration"], Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6 October 1890, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Australia ==
Religious freedom has developed partly due to the agreeable relationship between religious groups in its society. Several non-governmental organizations promoted tolerance and better understanding among religions in the country, both indigenous and non-indigenous. These groups included the Columbian Centre for Christian-Muslim Relations, the National Council of Churches in Australia and its affiliated Aboriginal and Islander Commission, and the Australian Council of Christians and Jews. In Victoria, Australia the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 makes illegal "conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons" on the grounds of religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/rarta2001265/|title=Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, in response to an increase in anti-Islamic sentiment, the HREOC undertook a project involving national consultations on eliminating prejudice against Arab and Muslim citizens. As part of the consultations, the commission considered whether Muslim citizens shared an ethnic origin or race, as well as a religion, which would entitle them to comprehensive protection under the Federal Race Discrimination Act. The commission's report, made public in June 2004, contained no findings on the racial status of Arab and Muslim citizens. In January 2005 the leader of the neo-Nazi Australian Nationalist Movement was connected to incidents in 2004 in which several Asian-owned businesses and a synagogue in Perth were firebombed or sprayed with racist graffiti. On December 11, 2005, there was a riot in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla, that erupted because a group of Lebanese-Australian youths had assaulted two lifeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib101068/2gb%2520-%2520report%25201485.pdf|title=Error {{!}} ACMA|website=www.acma.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrators against the assault displayed anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans. When the gathering turned violent, bystanders perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin or Muslim were attacked. The following day, retaliatory vandalism and other assaults were reported around Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71333.htm|title=Australia|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an alternate form of religious paranoia of a psychiatric nature, the patient can suffer from a permanent delusion of a primarily religious nature. He could, for example, believe that he is the messenger of God who has been sent to the world to propagate some religion.

{{Bertrand Russell}}

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God? [1952]|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Slater|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 11: Last Philosophical Testament, 1943–68|year=1952|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/cpbr11p69.pdf|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=542–548|isbn=9780415094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9–22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Łukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78–80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J.

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence in religious parodies ==
The concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly [[Parody religion|religion-parodying]] concepts such as the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]]&lt;ref name = "goddel"/&gt; and the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2006"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Church of the Non-Believers | first=Gary | last=Wolf | date=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Wired News]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2006/11/atheism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s musician and psychedelic poet [[Daevid Allen]] of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]] employed the image of a flying teapot in his [[Gong (band)#Mythology|Planet Gong Universe]] and the ''[[Flying Teapot (album)|Flying Teapot]]'' album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book ''Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories &amp; Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15041">'''Spiritual direction''' is the practice of being with people as they attempt to deepen their relationship with the [[divinity|divine]], or to learn and grow in their own personal [[spirituality]].  The person seeking direction shares stories of his or her encounters of the divine, or how he or she is cultivating a life attuned to spiritual things.  The director listens and asks questions to assist the directee in his or her process of [[Introspection|reflection]] and spiritual growth. Spiritual direction advocates claim that it develops a deeper awareness with the spiritual aspect of being human, and that it is not [[psychotherapy]], counseling, or financial planning.

== Forms ==
While there is some degree of variability, there are primarily two forms of spiritual direction: regular direction and [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] direction. They differ largely in the frequency of meeting and in the intensity of reflection.

Regular direction can involve a one- to two-hour meeting every four to eight weeks, and thus is slightly less intense than retreat direction, although spiritual exercises and disciplines are often given for the directee to attempt between meetings.

If the directee is on a retreat (lasting a weekend, a week or even 40 days), he or she will generally meet with his or her director on a daily basis for one hour. During these daily meetings, exercises or spiritual disciplines such as [[lectio divina]] are given to the directee as fodder to continue his or her spiritual growth. Alternatively, retreat centres often offer direction or companionship to persons visiting the centre alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510043839/http://www.rivendellretreat.org/personal.html |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola]] are a popular example of guidelines used for spiritual direction.

== Historical traditions ==

=== Western Christianity ===
Within [[Christianity]], spiritual direction has its roots in [[early Church|Early Christianity]].  The [[gospel]]s describe [[Jesus]] serving as a mentor to his disciples. Additionally, [[The Book of Acts|Acts of the Apostles]] Chapter 9 describes Ananias helping [[Paul of Tarsus]] to grow in his newfound experience of Christianity.  Likewise, several of the [[Pauline epistles]] describe Paul mentoring both Timothy and Titus among others.  Tradition tells us that [[John the Evangelist]] tutored [[Polycarp]], the 2nd-century bishop of [[Smyrna]].

Theologian [[John Cassian]] who lived in the 4th century provided some of the earliest recorded guidelines on the Christian practice of spiritual direction.&lt;ref name=christ&gt;{{cite web | title = Got Your 'Spiritual Director' Yet? |publisher= [[Christianity Today]] | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/aprilweb-only/4-28-51.0.html?paging=off 
|date=April 1, 2003| accessdate = 2014-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced mentoring in the monasteries. Each novice was put under the care of an older monk. [[Benedict of Nursia]] integrated Cassian's guidelines into what is now known as the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]].

Spiritual direction is widespread in the Catholic religion: a person with wisdom and spiritual discernment, usually but not exclusively a priest or consecrated in general, provides counsel to a person who wishes to make a journey of faith and discovery of God's will in his life. The spiritual guide aims to discern, understand what the Holy Spirit, through the situations of life, spiritual insights fruit of prayer, reading and meditation on the Bible, tells the person accompanied. The spiritual father or spiritual director may provide advice, give indications of life and prayer, resolving doubts in matters of faith and morals without replacing the choices and decisions to the person accompanying.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Eastern Orthodoxy comes from the same pre-schism traditions, but the role of a "spiritual director" or "elder" in Orthodoxy has maintained its important role.  The original Greek term geron (meaning "elder", as in gerontology) was rendered by the Russian word [[starets]], from Old Church Slavonic starĭtsĭ, "elder", derived from starŭ, "old". The Greek tradition has a long unbroken history of elders and disciples, such as [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] and [[John Moschos]] in the seventh century, [[Symeon the Studite|Symeon the Elder]] and [[Symeon the New Theologian]] in the eleventh century, and contemporary charismatic gerontes such as [[Porphyrios (Bairaktaris) of Kafsokalivia|Porphyrios]] and [[Paisios (Eznepidis)|Paisios]]. [[Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[Nil Sorsky]] were two most venerated startsy of Old [[Muscovy]]. The revival of elders in the Slavic world is associated with the name of [[Paisius Velichkovsky]] (1722–94), who produced the Russian translation of the [[Philokalia]]. The most famous Russian starets of the early 19th century was [[Seraphim of Sarov]] (1759-1833), who went on to become one of the most revered Orthodox saints.
The [[Optina Pustyn]] near [[Kozelsk]] used to be celebrated for its startsy (Schema-Archimandrite Moses, Schema-Hegumen Anthony, Hieroschemamonk Leonid, Hieroschemamonk Macarius, Hieroschemamonk Hilarion, Hieroschemamonk Ambrose, Hieroschemamonk Anatole (Zertsalov)).[1] Such writers as [[Nikolay Gogol]], [[Aleksey Khomyakov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Konstantin Leontyev]] sought advice from the elders of this monastery. They also inspired the figure of Zosima in Dostoyevsky's novel [[The Brothers Karamazov]]. A more modern example of a starets is Archimandrite [[John Krestiankin]] (1910-2006) of the [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]] who was popularly recognized as such by many [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] living in [[Russia]].

=== Judaism ===
In [[Judaism]], the Hebrew term for spiritual director differs among traditional communities. The verb ''Hashpa'ah'' is common in some communities though not all; the spiritual director called a ''mashpi'a'' occurs in the [[Habad]]-Lubavitch community and also in the [[Jewish Renewal]] community. A  ''mashgiakh ruchani'' is the equivalent role among [[mitnagedim]] (adherents of the ''[[Musar movement|mussar]]'' tradition). The purpose of hashpa'ah is to support the directee in her or his personal relationship with God, and to deepen that person's ability to find God's presence in ordinary life. Amongst [[Lubavitchers]] this draws on the literature and praxis of [[Hasidism]] as it is practiced according to Habad standards, and to Jewish mystical tradition generally. Spiritual mentorship is customary in the Hasidic world, but not necessarily in the same way.

=== Sufism ===
In [[Sufism]], the term used for spiritual master is ''[[murshid]]'', Arabic for "guide" or "teacher". He is more than a spiritual director and believed to be guiding the disciples based on his direct connectivity with the Divine. The murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path after the disciple takes an oath of allegiance or [[Bay'ah]] (''bai'ath'') with him. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as Insan-e-Kamil) is significant in most [[tariqa]]s. The doctrine states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a [[Qutb]] or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet [[Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="Murshid Kamil Akmal (Perfect Spiritual Guide)"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Perfect Spiritual Guide (Murshid-e-Kamil Akmal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVxlAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=murshid+kamil+akmal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=murshid%20kamil%20akmal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Reckoning of Time''''' ({{lang-la|De temporum ratione}}) is an [[Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxon era]] [[treatise]] written in [[Medieval Latin]] by the [[Northumbrian]] monk [[Bede]] in 725. The treatise includes an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the cosmos, including an explanation of how the spherical Earth influenced the changing length of daylight, of how the seasonal motion of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] influenced the changing appearance of the [[new moon]] at evening twilight, and a quantitative relation between the changes of the tides at a given place and the daily motion of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (2004:82–85;307–312).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Reckoning of Time'' describes a variety of ancient calendars, including the [[Germanic calendar|Anglo-Saxon calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html Chapter XV, De mensibus Anglorum.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallis (2004:82–85;307–312).&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of ''{{lang|la|De temporum ratione}}'' was calculation of the date of Easter, for which Bede described the method developed by [[Dionysius Exiguus#Easter tables|Dionysius Exiguus]]. ''{{lang|la|De temporum ratione}}'' also gave instructions for calculating the date of the Easter [[full moon]], for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the [[zodiac]], and for many other calculations related to the calendar.

Bede based his reasoning for the dates on the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The functions of the universe and its purpose are generally referenced by scripture. According to the introduction by [[Faith Wallis]] in the 1999 English translated edition of ''The Reckoning of Time'', Bede aimed to write a Christian work that integrated the astronomical understanding of computing with a theological context of history. The book is also regarded by Bede to be a sequel to his works ''The Nature of Things'' and ''On Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Faith |title=Bede: The Reckoning of Time |year=1999 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=0853236933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
The work is divided into six sections:

===1. Technical preparation (Chapters 1–4)===
This section familiarizes the reader with terminology regarding measurements.

In chapter 3 Bede defines a day as being 12 hours long. An hour consists of increments of ''{{lang|la|puncti}}'', ''{{lang|la|partes}}'' and ''{{lang|la|mementa}}''. Each of which are small increments of time within the hour. The smallest increment of time is the atom.

===2. The Julian calendar (Chapters 5–41)===
Here, Bede gives an exhaustive overview of the date of the Earth's creation, the months, the weeks and the Moon.

He argues that the first day did not, as it was generally believed, take place at the time of an equinox. According to the religious accounts of God's creation of the universe, light was created on the first day. It wasn't until the fourth day, however, that God created the stars and therefore there was no measurement of hours.

Much of this section is devoted to the Moon. Bede goes into extensive detail about measuring the moon's cycles, the Moon's relationship to the Earth and Sun. Bede discusses the Moon's relationship to the tide and calculating ''{{lang|la|kalends}}''.

===3. Anomalies of lunar reckoning (Chapters 42–43)===
These two chapters pick up where the previous section left off on examining the irregularities of the Moon creating a leap year as well as why, according to Bede, the Moon appears older than it actually is.

===4. The Paschal table (Chapters 44–65)===
This section explores different year cycles that include varying numbers of months and days, determining the year cycle of Christ's incarnation, Easter, and other moon cycles.

===5. The Minor Chronicle (Chapter 66)===
Bede gives an exhaustive description of the Six Ages of the World.

Bede details the First Age, from Adam to Noah, as being 1,656&amp;nbsp;years long according to the Hebrew Bible or 2,242&amp;nbsp;years according to the Septuagint.

The Second Age, from Noah to Abraham, is 292&amp;nbsp;years or 272&amp;nbsp;years long based on Bede's evaluation of the Hebrew Bible and Septuagint respectively.

The Third Age is said to be 942&amp;nbsp;years long according to both the Hebrew Bible and Septuagint spanning from the Abraham to David.

The Fourth age is from David until the Babylonian exile. This is 473&amp;nbsp;years according to the Hebrew Bible or 485 according to the Septuagint.

The Fifth age is from the Babylonian exile to the advent of Christ.

The Sixth age is the current age lasting from the advent of Christ until the end of days.

===6. Prophecy (Chapters 67–71)===
Finally, Bede goes on to discuss the end of the Sixth Age, discusses the second coming of Christ, the Antichrist, Judgement Day, and the Seventh and Eighth ages of the world to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Faith |title=Bede: The Reckoning of Time |year=1999 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |isbn=0853236933 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''theophoric name''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|θεόφορος}}, ''theophoros'', literally "bearing or carrying a god")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theophoric|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theophoric|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster online dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|qeo/foros|θεόφορος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; embeds the name of a god, both invoking and displaying the protection of that deity. For example, names embedding [[Apollo]], such as ''Apollonios'' or ''Apollodorus'', existed in Greek antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Shendge, Malati J. ''The Language of the Harappans: From [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]'', 1997. p 24. "It may also be interpreted as theophorous names, i.e. the name of the god forming part of the name of an individual. The usage is theophorous because besides the [[eponymous]] Asura, each individual of high or low status has a [[personal name]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophoric personal names, containing the name of a god in whose care the individual is entrusted (or a generic word for ''god''), were also exceedingly common in the [[ancient Near East]] and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Zadok, R. ''The Pre-[[Hellenistic period|hellenistic]] [[Israelite]] [[Anthroponymy]] and [[Prosopography]]'', 1988. p 16. "The Period of the Judges (J) The theophorous names constitute a sizable minority (almost 40%). Many of the hypocoristica possibly originate from compound theophorous names (e.g., Abdon, Gerd, J21 1 1 1 1, 2141 12)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Frank L. ''Personal Names in the [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Punic language|Punic]] Inscriptions''. p 233. "Any one of the three major types of elements, [[divine name]] or theophorous, nominal, or verbal can make up a Phoenician-Punic [[hypocoristic name]]. The divine name [[hypocoristic]] is the least attested. The simplest formation is that of a single ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drijvers, H. J. W. ''Cults and Behafs at Edessa'', 1980. p 21. "The proper names, which are mainly theophorous ones, may increase our knowledge of the religious feeling of the people of [[Edessa]] and of the [[cult]]s practiced by them, insofar as their theophorous elements reflect existing beliefs."&lt;/ref&gt;  Some names of theophoric origin remain common today, such as [[Theodore (given name)|Theodore]] (''theo-'', "god"; ''-dore'', origin of word compound in Greek: ''doron'', "gift"; hence "God's gift"; in Greek: ''Theodoros'') or less recognisably as ''[[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]]'' (from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] Yonatan, meaning "Yahweh has given").

==Classical theophoric names==
* [[Demetrius]] and its derivatives mean "follower of [[Demeter]]."
* [[Dennis]], in Latin ''Dionysius'', and its relatives mean "of [[Dionysus]]."
* [[Martin (name)|Martin]] and its relatives mean "of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]."
* [[Zeno (disambiguation)|Zeno]] and Diodoros or Diodorus from [[Zeus]] (genitive of Zeus is 'dios'); Poseidonios from [[Poseidon]]; Athenodoros/Athenodora from [[Athena]] and Minervina from [[Minerva]]; Apollodoros/Apollodora and Apollonios from [[Apollo]]n; Artemisia and Artemidoros/Artemidora from [[Artemis]]; Aphrodesia from [[Aphrodite]]; Hephaistion from [[Hephaistos]]; Aria from [[Ares]]; Hermione from [[Hermes]]; Heliodoros/a from [[Helios]]; Fortunatus from [[Fortuna]]; Serapion from [[Serapis]] and Isidoros or Isidora from [[Isis]].
* Certain names of classical gods are sometimes given as personal names. The most common is [[Diana (given name)|Diana]] and its variants, such as [[Diane (given name)|Diane]]; others include [[Minerva (mythology)|Minerva]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Isis]], or [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. The first [[pope]] to take a [[regnal name]], [[Pope John II]], had the given name [[Mercury (god)|Mercurius]] and changed his name as he considered it inappropriate for the Pope to have the name of a pagan deity.

Some Christian saints have polytheistic theophoric names (such as [[Saint Dionysius]], [[Saint Mercurius]], [[Saint Saturninus (disambiguation)|Saint Saturninus]], [[Saint Hermes]], Saint [[Martin of Tours]], [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]],).

==Germanic theophoric names==
* [[Aesir|Os]], meaning "god"
** [[Oslac (name)|Oslac]]
** [[Oswald (given name)|Oswald]]
** [[Oswine (disambiguation)|Oswin]]
* [[Thor]], the god of thunder
** [[Torsten|Thorstein]] means "Thor's stone"
** [[Thorkel]] means "Thor's craft"
** Thorulf means "Thor's wolf"
** [[Thordis]]
** [[Thora (given name)|Thora]]
* [[Yngvi|Ing]], an old name for [[Freyr]] (an epithet meaning "lord")
** [[Ingrid (given name)|Ingrid]]
** [[Ingeborg]]
** [[Inger (given name)|Inger]]
** [[Ingunn]]

Rarely, Germanic names contain the element ''[[odhr|Wod]]'' (such as ''Woðu-riðe''), potentially pointing to an association with the god [[Odin]]. In connection, numerous names containing ''wulf'' "wolf" have been taken as totemistic, expressing association with Odin in the earliest period, although ''-ulf'' degenerated into a mere suffix from an early time (Förstemann 1856).

==Hinduism==
Some traditional Hindu names honor Hindu gods or goddesses. Often, the same name is ascribed to multiple deities.

It is not uncommon to find Hindus with names of gods. Shiva, Krishna, Ganesh, Durga, Radha, and Sita are all names of Hindu gods or goddesses as well as being personal names for Hindus. Hindu gods themselves have multiple names, so it is not always apparent if an Indian name is the name of a god or not.

==Judaism and biblical==
{{Main|Theophory in the Bible}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}
Much [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] theophory occurs in the [[Bible]], particularly in the [[Old Testament]]. The most prominent theophory involves
* names referring to [[El (god)|El]], a word meaning ''might'', ''power'' and (a) ''god'' in general, and hence in Judaism, ''God'' and among the Canaanites the name of the god who was the father of Baal.
* names referring to [[Names of God in Judaism#Yah|Yah]], a shortened form of [[Yahweh]].
* names referring to Levantine deities (especially the storm god, [[Hadad]]) by the [[epithet]] ''[[Baal]]'', meaning ''lord''. 

In later times, as the conflict between [[Yahweh#Origins and_adoption as "God of Israel"|Yahwism]] and the more popular pagan practices became increasingly intense, these names were censored and ''Baal'' was replaced with ''Bosheth'', meaning ''shameful one''. However the name Yahweh does not appear in theophoric names until the time of Joshua, and for the most part is very rare until the time of King Saul, when it began to be very popular.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Haughwout, "Personal Names Before Exodus 6:2-3" [http://markhaughwout.com/Bible/Prefixes_suffixes_divine_names_Genesis.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===El===
{{See also|El (deity)}}
* [[Ariel (given name)|Ariel]]: "lion of God"
* [[Daniel]]: "God is my judge" or "justice from God"
* [[Elias]]/Elijah: "my God is Yahweh"
* [[Elisha (given name)|Elisha]]: "my God is salvation"
* [[Elizabeth (given name)|Elizabeth]]: Hebrew [[Elisheba]] = "my God is an oath" or "my God is abundance"''
* Emmanuel/[[Immanuel]]: "God is with us"
* [[Ezekiel (name)|Ezekiel]]: "God will strengthen"
* [[Gabriel]]: "God is my strength"
* [[Ishmael]]: "God has heard"
* [[Israel (name)|Israel]]: "who prevails with God"
* [[Joel (given name)|Joel]]: "Yahweh is God"
* [[Lemuel]]: "Dedicated/Devoted to God"
* [[Michael]]: "Who is like God?"
* [[Nathaniel]]: "God-given" or "gift of God"
* [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]]: "God heals"
* [[Samuel]]: "name of God"
* [[Uriel]]: "God is my light"

===Yahweh===
{{See also|Yahweh|YHWH}}
The name of the Israelite deity YHWH (usually shortened to Yah or Yahu, and Yeho or Yo) appears as a prefix or suffix in many theophoric names of the [[First Temple Period]]. For example, ''Yirme-yahu'' ([[Jeremiah]]), ''Yesha-yahu'' ([[Isaiah]]), ''Netan-yah'', ''Yedid-yah'', ''Adoni-yah'', ''Nekhem-yah'', ''Yeho-natan'' ([[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]]), ''Yeho-chanan'' ([[John (given name)|John]]), ''Yeho-shua'' ([[Joshua]]), ''Yeho-tzedek'', ''Zekharya'' ([[Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]).

"Yahū" or "Yah" is the abbreviation of YHWH when used as a suffix in Hebrew names; as a prefix it appears as "Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hō-", or "Yo". It was formerly thought to be abbreviated from the [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pronunciation "[[Yehovah]]". There is an opinion&lt;ref&gt;Anson F. Rainey, [http://members.fortunecity.com/yahuwthah/Resource-577/AnsonLetter.htm How Yahweh Was Pronounced] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202034811/http://members.fortunecity.com/yahuwthah/Resource-577/AnsonLetter.htm |date=December 2, 2011 }}, QUERIES &amp; COMMENTS.&lt;/ref&gt; that, as Yahweh is likely an [[imperfective]] verb form, "Yahu" is its corresponding [[preterite]] or [[jussive]] short form: compare ''yiŝt&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;hawe&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;'' (imperfective), ''yiŝtáhû'' (preterit or jussive short form) = "do obeisance".

* Elijah/[[Elias]]: "my God is YHWH"
* [[Hezekiah]]: "YHWH strengthens"
* [[Isaias (given name)|Isaiah]]: "YHWH is salvation"
* [[Jedediah]]: "friend of YHWH"
* Jeremy/[[Jeremiah (given name)|Jeremiah]]: "YHWH will raise"
* [[Joel (given name)|Joel]]: "YHWH is God"
* [[Yohanan|John]]: "graced by YHWH"
* [[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]]: "YHWH has given"
* [[Joseph]]: "YHWH shall increase"
* [[Josiah (given name)|Josiah]]: "healed by YHWH"
* [[Matthew (given name)|Matthew]]: "gift of YHWH"
* [[Book of Micah|Micah]]: "who is like YHWH?"
* [[Nehemiah]]: "YHWH comforts"
* [[Obadiah]]: "servant of YHWH"
* [[Tobias]]: "the goodness of YHWH"
* [[Uriah (disambiguation)|Uriah]]: "flame of YHWH"
* [[Uzziah]]: "YHWH is my strength"
* Zachary/[[Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]: "YHWH has remembered"
* [[Zephaniah]]: "hidden by YHWH"

However, the name [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] (Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hūda&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;) is not an example.  The name Judah, comes from the root word Yadah = Yud-Dalet-Hey, which means "praise".  The letter Yud is also a prefix pronoun in Hebrew, thus not every name or word beginning with Yud or Yud-Hey is theophoric.

In the table below, 13 theophoric names with "Yeho" have corresponding forms where the letters ''eh'' have been omitted. There is a theory by [[Christian Ginsburg]] that this is due to Hebrew scribes omitting the "h", changing Jeho ({{hebrew|יְהוֹ}}) into Jo ({{hebrew|יוֹ}}), to make the start of "Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ho-" names not sound like an attempt to pronounce the Divine Name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Ginsburg]], Introduction To the Massoretico-Critical Edition Of The Hebrew Bible, p 369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jones, [http://www.lamblion.net/Articles/ScottJones/jehovah1.htm Jehovah] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215095417/http://www.lamblion.net/Articles/ScottJones/jehovah1.htm |date=December 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Referring to other gods===
* [[Abijam]]: "my father is [[Yam (god)|Yam]]"
* [[Nebuchadnezzar]] (in [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], ''[[Nabu]]-kudurri-usur'')
* [[Ishbaal]]: "man of [[Baal]]".
* [[Mark (given name)|Mark]]: "dedicated to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]".
* [[Jezebel]]: "glory to Baal".

Theophoric names containing "[[Baal]]" were sometimes "censored" as ''-bosheth'' = "shameful one", whence [[Ishbosheth]] etc.

Some names might be controversial theological statements: ''[[Bealiah]]'' could mean ''Baal is Yahweh'' and ''[[Elijah]]'' could mean ''Yahweh is El'' (and vice versa, respectively).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} On the other hand, as traditionally understood, these names simply mean "YHWH is Master" and "YHWH is God." {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{Jewish feminism}}
'''Women of the Wall''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נשות הכותל, ''Neshot HaKotel'') is a multi-denominational feminist&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=644}}: "The Women of the Wall believed themselves to be liberal feminists."&lt;/ref&gt; organization based in [[Israel]] whose goal is to secure the rights of women to pray at the [[Western Wall]], also called the Kotel, in a fashion that includes singing, reading aloud from the [[Torah]] and wearing religious garments (''[[tallit]]'', ''[[tefillin]]'' and ''[[kippah]]''). Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that place "high" restrictions on religion,&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208392.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of those restrictions is that the Rabbi of the Western Wall has enforced gender segregation and limitations on religious garb worn by women.  When the "Women of the Wall" hold monthly prayer services for women on [[Rosh Hodesh]], they observe gender segregation so that Orthodox members may fully participate.  But their use of religious garb, singing and reading from a Torah have upset some members of the Orthodox Jewish community, sparking protests and arrests. In May 2013 a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html|title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|date=December 25, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-western-wall-prayer.html|title=Israel Approves Prayer Space at Western Wall for Non-Orthodox Jews|date=1 February 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan faced opposition from other factions, including some ultra-Orthodox members of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s governing coalition, who threatened to withdraw over the government's plan to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the [[Western Wall]] in deference to the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-facing-crisis-as-Haredim-vow-to-quit-over-Western-Wall-pluralism-447102 Netanyahu facing crisis as haredim vow to quit over Western Wall pluralism]. The Jerusalem Post, March 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Kotel within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is access to the Kotel.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-sweeping-decision-high-court-rules-for-womens-western-wall-prayer/ |title=In landmark decision, High Court rules for women's Western Wall prayer |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition for women to read from the Torah at the Kotel had been brought by a group that split off from the Women of the Wall, calling itself the "Original Women of the Wall".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sales |first=Ben |url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/06/26/suspension-of-western-wall-deal-leaves-jewish-leaders-feeling-betrayed/ |title=Suspension of Western Wall deal leaves Jewish leaders feeling betrayed – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2017-06-26 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/06/25/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/netanyahu-rescinds-pluralistic-western-wall-agreement |title=Israel freezes Western Wall compromise that was to create egalitarian prayer section &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronit Kampf, the group's struggle has been "the most covered women's issue in the history of the Israeli media."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haberman|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Western Wall before sunset.jpg|thumb|250px|The Western Wall (August 2012)]]
From the start, Women of the Wall included Orthodox members and opted to run their service according to "Orthodox standards." Nevertheless, some Orthodox individuals were offended, including some who call themselves Orthodox feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|p=184}}: "A third reason for choosing Orthodox services was out awareness that if we did not adopt Orthodox standards, Orthodox women would not attend our services or, in all likelihood, support our struggle. Non-Orthodox women who have been involved in the Kotel struggle have been most generous in allowing Orthodox practice to prevail, and our services at the Kotel as well as the solidarity services we sponsored elsewhere therefore have been conducted in accordance with Orthodox standards. Despite this many Orthodox women, even those who were active in women's ''tefillah'' groups and leaders of Orthodox feminism, remained reticent and ambivalent about our struggle to pray at the Kotel, and Orthodox rabbis, even those who permitted women's ''tefillah'' their synagogues, did not support our right to pray in an identical fashion at the Kotel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "The movement, which is controversial, even among Orthodox feminists, myself included..."&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall is a multi-denominational group, including Reform, Conservative and Orthodox members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.679974 Amid Violence, Women of the Wall Vote Not to Engage Police This Month] Haaretz, Oct 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, the group has faced a legal battle for recognition of their right to pray at the Western Wall. Their presence is deemed offensive by Orthodox worshippers at the site and there have been numerous court proceedings to settle the issue. On the [[Fast of Esther]] 1989, ultra-Orthodox men, outraged by the women's singing, hurled chairs and verbal insults at the women, which resulted in the deployment of tear gas to quell the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, police arrested two [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the first woman was arrested for praying with a ''tallit''. The struggle by the Women of the Wall is seen by the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment as an attempt to undermine their influence in an effort to introduce religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition from the Orthodox also stems from Halachic concerns and from a general disdain for non-traditional ritual in an area they claim serves as an Orthodox synagogue. Orthodoxy does not permit women to constitute a ''[[minyan]]'' (prayer quorum) and while the women have not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|Young|1999|p=207}}: "Known as "the Women of the Wall," these women, out of deference to the group's Orthodox members, have used traditional liturgical texts and have not considered themselves to be a ''minyan''. Halakhically, at least as understood by Orthodoxy, women cannot constitute or count as members of a prayer quorum. Nonetheless, they have become the target of great opposition and occasional violence from ultra Orthodox Jews. [...] Women of the Wall continue to face opposition from ultra Orthodox Jews who are against women's prayer groups in general.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|Rubio-Marin|2005|p=214}}: "The Women of the Wall organization represents a group of observant Jewish women who pray together in a ''minyan'' -  a religious quorum traditionally reserved for men. This form of collective worship is not acceptable to ultra-Orthodox Jews when practiced by women."&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the group did not receive support from Israel's primarily Orthodox religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambré|2002|p=12}}: "But, at the kotel, where tradition trumps individual choice, the guidelines have not changed because they are not only a matter of acknowledging the desires of this group, which itself would radically alter Jewish tradition, but because the group lacks the support of any major religious authority. At the same time, acceding to their requests might also mean giving parity to non-Orthodox denominations."&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters highlighted the fact that only in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "Supporters of the Women of the Wall note the irony that "only in Israel, and at the site most holy to Jews...are Jewish women prohibited from praying aloud in a group with a Torah."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|2005|p=552}}: "In 2003, the Women of the Wall, a group of more than 100 Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform women, lost their 14-year legal battle to hold formal women's prayer services at the Western Wall. The High Court ruled that the group could not hold prayer services at the Western Wall and instead would be permitted to hold them at nearby Robinson's Arch."&lt;/ref&gt; was overturned in 2013.

Some Orthodox feminist organisations have voiced support for their right to pray at the Kotel.&lt;ref name=Maltz0613&gt;{{cite news|last=Maltz|first=Judy|title= The new Orthodox face of Women of the Wall|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/the-new-orthodox-face-of-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.516416/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=April 19, 2013}}: "Although Women of the Wall is widely associated with the Reform movement, it is very much based on an Orthodox model, says Elana Sztokman, the executive director of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, an international organization based in New York."&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was created by Jewish women, including some from the diaspora,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}: "Initiated in 1988 by North American women, the Women of the Wall have been trying to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem with Torah reading as the women's tefillah (prayer) groups do in America."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=202}}: "The story of the Women of the Wall began on December 2, 1988, when a group of approximately 100 women participants in the First International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem held a prayer service at the Western Wall. American-born women for the most part, they were accustomed to the more egalitarian religious practises that characterize American Judaism."&lt;/ref&gt; and a significant number of participants are American immigrants or part of the English-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}: "The Israeli women, most of whom were American-born, pledged to return to the Wall on the first day of each month in order to carry out a prayer service."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ben-David|2003|p=26}}: "It is not surprising that a disproportionate number of the Women of the Wall are, like Ner-David, American immigrants, or part of the larger native English-speaking Israeli community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}: "While noted in Israel, these incidents receive far more attention in the United States. The main reason for the publicity is that the worshipers drawing ire are disproportionately American."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|1991|p=298}}: "Women of the Wall, organized to literally and metaphorically break down the barriers to women's prayer at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. Most of the initiators and participants in these activities have been immigrants from English-speaking countries."&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the differing social conditions of Orthodox women in the United States and Israel respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Satlow|2006|p=67}}: "By and larger, Israeli Orthodox women focus their religious life domestically. The growing difference between the roles of women in Western and Israeli Orthodoxy is in part due to social conditions. Whereas in the United States, for example, the push toward increasing female participation in religious services is primarily driven by highly educated, professional women who experience a gap between their high-status place in the secular world and their confinement behind the mechitza in the synagogue, the achievement of higher education and high-status jobs by Orthodox women in Israel is far rarer."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Rosner]] describes the phenomena as an "American-imported battle" for religious pluralism, religious moderation and tolerance. He notes that civil rights and feminism are American imports, late in coming to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;(Renee Ghert-Zand). [http://www.timesofisrael.com/where-rock-star-anat-hoffman-turns-raging-feminist/ Where ‘rock star’ Anat Hoffman turns raging feminist], ''Times of Israel'',(April 20, 2013). ""The whole battle for the Western Wall is an Americanized and American-imported battle for religious moderation and tolerance," explains Shmuel Rosner, senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and L.A. Jewish Journal columnist. "Women wearing a tallit is not something Israelis are used to. They don't necessarily have negative feelings about it, but it's just strange and feels like it doesn't belong here."" and "Many Israelis dismiss Women of the Wall as foreign interlopers, "but there is something to be said about Women of the Wall appearing non-native," Sztokman offers. "Civil rights and feminism are American imports — and late in coming. But now these things are being adapted to the local context."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:WOW Torah Reading.jpg|thumb|WOW Torah Reading]]
Twenty-five years after the founding of WoW, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute in May 2013 found that about half of the Israel public supports the Women of the Wall, and that men (51.5%) are more inclined to support the women's prayer group than women (46%) The poll was conducted by Professor Tamar Hermann, who noted that Women of the Wall received highest levels of support from educated, secular, Ashkenazi Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/poll-half-of-israelis-support-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.523651|title=Poll: Half of Israelis support Women of the Wall|date=13 May 2013|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group was not always met with support from the majority of Israelis, as it is today.

Women of the Wall was founded in December 1988 at the first International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1988, during the conference, Rivka Haut organized a group of multi-denominational women to pray at the Western Wall. 70 women carried a Torah scroll to the [[Western Wall]], and Rabbi [[Deborah Brin]] led a prayer service for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahalatshalom.org/who-we-are/our-rabbi/78-about/163-women-of-the-wall-founding-rabbi-deborah-brin.html|title=Women of the Wall founding Rabbi Deborah Brin - Nahalat Shalom|author=Judy B|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francine Klagsbrun]] was the one chosen to carry the Torah at the head of the group, making her the first woman to carry a Torah to the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/klagsbrun-francine |title=Francine Klagsbrun &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the conference ended, a group of Jerusalem women led by Bonna Devora Haberman continued to meet at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] and formed Women of the Wall to assert their right to pray there without hindrance.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/WOW.html |first=Sarah |last=Szymkowicz |title=Women Of The Wall |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall has fought a legal battle asserting a right to conduct organized prayer at the Kotel and challenging government and private intervention in its efforts. After demanding police protection, the government was given nine months to make arrangements that would allow them to pray unhindered. At the end of this period, the Ministry of Religion ruled that only prayer according to the "custom of the place" was to be permitted and that "the sensitivities of other worshippers" must not be offended.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Women of the Wall then petitioned the Supreme Court to recognize their right to pray at the Wall. A temporary ruling was given which stated that the ''status quo'' should be enforced until they reached a final verdict.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"/&gt;

The legal battles between the High Court of Justice and the Women of the Wall continued between 1995 and 2000. The Israeli government did not uphold the position that they would find a way for the Women of the Wall to pray, which resulted in an appeal from the Women of the Wall to the High Court of Justice in 1995. This concluded in April 1996, determining the solution was to move the Women of the Wall's prayer from the Western Wall to the Robinson's Arch. Robinson's Arch was not in the area of main prayer. The Women of the Wall appealed this decision to the Ne'eman Committee in 1998, who reaffirmed the previous decision of the High Court Justice. The Women of the Wall accepted the decision on the condition that the area they were being moved to be set up to be a proper prayer area. The government did not do such preparations of the prayer area in Robinson's Arch, resulting in the appeal to the Supreme Court in 2000 by the Women of the Wall. In this appeal, the supreme court ruled that the Israeli government was required to allow the Women of the Wall to exercise their religious freedom and practices at the Western Wall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=2016-04-02|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=79–107|doi=10.1353/sho.2016.0001|issn=1534-5165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle has led to two Israeli Supreme Court decisions and a series of debates in the [[Knesset]]. In its first decision, on May 22, 2002, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that it is legal for Women of the Wall to hold prayer groups and read Torah in the women's section of the main Kotel plaza undisturbed. Four days later, [[Haredi]] political parties including [[Shas]] introduced several bills to overturn the decision, including a bill that would have made it a criminal offense for women to pray in non-traditional ways at the Western Wall, punishable by up to seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; In response MK Naomi Chazan said "What have we become? Afghanistan? Iran?"&lt;ref name=LAT2000/&gt; Although the bill did not pass, the Israeli Supreme Court reconsidered its earlier decision. On April 6, 2003, the Court reversed itself and upheld, 5-4, the Israeli government's ban prohibiting the organization from reading Torah or wearing tallit or tefillin at the main public area at the Wall, on the grounds that such continued meetings represented a threat to public safety and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030423.html|title="The Israeli Supreme Court Denies Women The Right to Pray at the Western Wall", Findlaw.

WOW leader [[Anat Hoffman]] reacted harshly to the plan. "Now we're going to be praying at an archeological site, at an alternative site for the Jews of a lesser degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krieger|first1=Hilary Leila|last2=Izenberg|first2=Dan|title=Women of the Wall Wail Over New Prayer Site|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=31 October 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-86894411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was inaugurated in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharon|first=Jeremy|title=Police Detain Women at Kotel Over Prayer Shawls|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=22 May 2012|url=http://www.jtsa.edu/News/Top_Stories/Police_Detain_Women_at_Kotel.xml?ss=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, it was illegal for them to do so under Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/world/middleeast/22jerusalem.html?_r=0 Challenging Traditions at the Heart of Judaism], ''New York Times'', December 21, 2009. "After a lengthy legal battle, the court ultimately ruled against the women in the interest of public order. Consequently, it is illegal for them to read aloud from the Torah or to wear prayer shawls openly by the wall."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, following pressure from non-Orthodox US Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/women-of-the-wall-urge-jerusalem-police-to-refrain-from-arrests-at-upcoming-service.premium-1.514734 Women of the Wall urge Jerusalem police to refrain from arrests at upcoming service], ''Haaretz'', (April 10, 2013) "Under pressure from the non-Orthodox Jewish world, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Sharansky several months ago to draft .."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natan Sharansky]], the chairman of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], was asked by the Prime Minister to find a solution to the dispute.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard2"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/10/western-wall-resolve-prayer-rights Western Wall plan unveiled to resolve 24-year-old prayer rights dispute], (10 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the detentions at the wall in February 2013, Sharansky said "When I listen to the very partial presentation, I am fully with them — when I listen to the other side, I have to accept that they also have logic. We do have to find a solution in which nobody will feel discriminated against."&lt;ref name="nytfeb2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/Women-Praying-at-Western-Wall-Detained.html|title=Women Praying at Western Wall in Jerusalem Are Detained|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|date=11 February 2013|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Sharansky suggested constructing a third, egalitarian prayer center at the Wall that is identical in size and standing to the plaza currently controlled by the Orthodox Jews. This attempt was endorsed by the government to solve the controversy of the wall, but in actuality, this arrangement would have led to the emergence of a new conflict. Instead of ending the quarreling by granting women full rights to worship at the existing wall, the women would have had to fight for recognition among the public at their new area. The area for the women would have been located in what is known as the Robinson's Arch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, three women MKs used their [[parliamentary immunity]] to don prayer shawls and join the Women of the Wall in a show of support after 10 women had been arrested the previous month. MK [[Stav Shaffir]] ([[Israeli Labor Party|Labour]]) said "I usually do not wear a ''tallit'', but it is my honor and duty to stand here and protect the rights of all Jews from around the world to pray as they desire and believe." [[Tamar Zandberg]] ([[Meretz]]) said: "I demand to enter. The extremist stream's interpretation of the Holy Places Law is unacceptable to me, and I refuse to leave the prayer shawl outside.

MK [[Aliza Lavie]] ([[Yesh Atid]]), who herself supports the right of the women to assemble, said she was "shocked" that fellow MKs decided to blatantly disobey the law and ignore Supreme Court rulings. MK [[Miri Regev]] ([[Likud]]) called the MKs attendance a "provocation" and referred to the groups "anarchistic actions" which had "turned into a national sport among the extreme Left in Israel."

In May 2013, after bowing to pressure from non-Orthodox diaspora Jews, the government issued a directive for the legal dispute to be solved. A subsequent Appellate Court ruling gave permission&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10018346/Women-win-the-right-to-pray-like-men-at-Jerusalems-Western-Wall.html Women win the right to pray like men at Jerusalem's Western Wall], Robert Tait, Daily Telegraph, (April 25, 2013) "Women's rights campaigners won a potential landmark legal victory after a judge ruled that they should be allowed to pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, in a manner previously deemed only fit for men."&lt;/ref&gt; for the Women of the Wall to hold services at the site after deciding that their prayer and ritual were not against the "local custom" and since the women did not use physical or verbal violence, they could not be held responsible for any resulting disturbances. The Rabbi of the Western Wall, however, continues to view their presence as a provocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.thekotel.org/today/article.asp?ArticleID=162 Response of the Rabbi of the Western Wall to the Women of the Wall’s Provocative Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

They have the support of large American non-Orthodox denominations, which view the issue of women's rights to pray at the Wall as a high-profile opportunity to promote gender-egalitarian Jewish prayer, which most Israelis have never experienced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/176312/women-and-orthodox-waver-over-plan-for-egalitarian/?p=all Women and Orthodox Waver Over Plan for Egalitarian Prayer at Western Wall], Nathan Jeffay, ''Forward'', (May 10, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; They also want to remove the control of the holy site from the hands of the Western Wall rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reform.org.il/eng/About/NewsItem.asp?ContentID=1323 Women of the Wall: The Controversy Continues], Israel Movement for Reform &amp; Progressive Judaism, (March 18, 2013) "In January, 2013, WOW, the IMPJ and IRAC joined other organizations in filing a petition with the High Court of Justice against the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, demanding that non-orthodox Jews and women receive equal representation for managing the Wall, and requested the court "remove the control of the holy site from the hands of the Western Wall rabbi."&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests have been criticized by groups promoting religious pluralism in Israel. The Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), condemned the arrest of Anat Hoffman and called it a "desecration of God's name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Reform-Rabbis-Issue-Statement-Outrage-Israels-Arrest-Woman-Holding-Torah-Western-Wall-1289352.htm|title=Reform Rabbis Issue Statement of Outrage at Israel's Arrest of Woman for Holding Torah at Western Wall|work=Marketwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Women of the Wall launched a campaign to encourage girls to have their bat mitzvah services at the Kotel. Unlike most diaspora Jewish girls, Israeli Jewish girls typically do not celebrate a bat mitvah by reading from their Torah portion. The ad campaign features girls wearing prayer shawls and holding a Torah scroll in front of the wall. The ad, placed on Israeli buses, has the caption, "Mom, I also want a bat mitzvah at the Kotel!" The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which is controlled by the Orthodox and oversees events at the wall, not only runs a business of bar mitzvahs for boys that has excluded girls from their offerings, but has refused to permit women to carry Torah scrolls at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.620543|title=Women of the Wall bus ad campaign encourages bat mitzvahs at the Kotel|date=13 October 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the campaign ads were soon vandalized in Orthodox neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/207262/women-of-wall-push-for-bat-mitzvahs-at-western-wal/|title=Women of Wall Push for Bat Mitzvahs at Western Wall|date=13 October 2014|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad campaign received international publicity when religious extremists carried out violent attacks in Jerusalem.

Although the women have won the legal right to pray in their fashion at the wall, Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinowitz]], the Supervisor of the Western Wall, has refused to allow the women to use the Torah scrolls distributed in the men's section or to bring their own. The group said that a reading from the Torah scroll in the women's section was an historic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Women-of-the-Wall-smuggle-tiny-Torah-scroll-to-Western-Wall-for-Bat-Mitzva-379719|title=Women of the Wall smuggle tiny Torah scroll to Western Wall for Bat Mitzva|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2014 Women of the Wall held a women's candle lighting at the Kotel. For [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]s. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/&lt;/ref&gt; Wow sent a letter to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section just as there is one in the men's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act." Initially, the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.&lt;ref&gt;"Maltz, Judy 'Rabbi bans Women of the Wall's Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony' (Dec 14, 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Maltz 'Sarah Silverman joins Women activists at Western Wall Hanukkah ceremony: Kotel security confiscates prayer group's menorahs, returned only after complaint lodged with police.'

In April 2015 Women of the Wall participated in reading from a full-size Torah scroll at the organization's service at the Western Wall. One hundred Torah scrolls are kept for the use of the men's side of the Western Wall and male supporters of Women of the Wall passed a Torah scroll across the barrier into the women's section for Women of the Wall's service.

Police intervened and stopped them. Following the Torah reading service, WoW members in the women's section danced with the scroll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.652640 Women defy Western Wall ban and read from full-size Torah] Haaretz, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;"This is the first time that Women of the Wall can stand up and be counted as a part of the public," proclaimed Anat Hoffman, the chair of WoW. "Nothing you could say could tear me away from my Torah." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, the head of the rabbinic authority of the Western Wall, called the women's Torah reading a provocation and said "the Israel Police and employees of the Western Wall had to work hard in order to avoid bloodshed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-first-women-of-the-wall-pray-with-full-sized-torah-scroll/ In First, Women of the Wall pray with Full-Size Torah scroll] The Times of Israel, 20 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; A group calling itself Original Women of the Wall, which includes founding members of WoW and which contends that WOW has broken away from the original and on-going charter of the group. Original Women Of the Wall does not agree with the compromise and said its members will continue to hold prayer services at the Western Wall, praying as is their custom, with prayer shawls and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Original-Women-of-Wall-reject-compromise-at-site-443215 Original Women of Wall reject compromise at site] The Jerusalem Post, Feb 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Minister of Waqf and Religious Affairs Youssef Ideiss protested that the proposed egalitarian prayer section at the Western Wall violates the status-quo agreement governing the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-cry-foul-over-planned-mixed-gender-western-wall-section/ Palestinians cry foul] The Times of Israel, Feb 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

|In response to the ruling allowing the Women of the Wall to hold their services at the site, between 5,000-10,000 [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] girls converged to prevent the women from approaching. Police in turn offered protection to around 400 women who formed the largest gathering in the group's history. The women prayed together with a group of male supporters, the first time a mixed service had been held by the organisation. They had planned to bring a Torah scroll into the women's prayer section, but reneged upon the request of Minister of Religious Affairs [[Naftali Bennett]]. Three Haredi men were arrested for disturbing the peace. Chair of Women of the Wall, [[Anat Hoffman]], said "We are continuing in the footsteps of the paratroopers who liberated the Western Wall."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Women for the Wall]] is founded to campaign against the Women of the Wall.

|Threatening graffiti was sprayed on the front door of an executive board member of the Women of the Wall organisation. It read: "Peggy, you're the first. We know where you live. Jerusalem is holy. The Western Wall will not be forfeited. The Women of the Wall are villains." MK [[Michal Rozin]] ([[Meretz]]) blamed the attack on provocative statements by ultra-Orthodox MKs, and Jerusalem mayor [[Nir Barkat]] and his ultra-Orthodox deputy, Yitzhak Pindrus, denounced the act. Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinovitch]] of the Western Wall called it "a despicable incident," which "did not represent Judaism."

The letters stated that if the Women of the Wall are not allowed to pray according to their ways and custom, "we will fight you with all measures, and you will return home with 100 bodies of haredim... We will no longer practice restraint. We will re-liberate the Western Wall." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch had also received a similar letter. Women of the Wall said that the organization "had nothing to do with the act and that the style of these letters does not match the love of Israel spirit led by the group."

| [[United Torah Judaism]] arranged for between 5,000-7,000 Haredi girls to assemble at the wall and for the first time in 25 years, police prevented the Women of the Wall from approaching the site. Male protesters numbered around 1,000. The women, numbering around 300, held their service at the entrance to the Western Wall plaza and were occasionally disturbed by shouting and targeted at least twice by water bombs and eggs. An Orthodox man and women were arrested for public order offenses. [[Gilad Kariv]] of the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism|Reform Movement in Israel]] said the police had "given a reward to a small group of Haredi provocateurs and rabbis who deal in spreading baseless hatred." Orthodox Jerusalem deputy mayor Yitzhak Pindrus said "baseless hatred caused the greatest destruction to befall our people and we will not let a small group of agitators to continue to polarise with provocations and baseless hatred."

In their struggle for civil rights and religious freedom, members of the group have been willing to engage in civil disobedience and become "prisoners of conscience.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|pp=56–57}}: "But we might also have to go outside both the legal and political system.

She was fined 5,000 [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] and given a restraining order according to which she was not allowed to approach the Kotel for thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/police-arrest-women-of-the-wall-leader-for-praying-with-torah-scroll-1.301457|title=Police arrest Women of the Wall leader for praying with Torah scroll|date=12 July 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2012, Hoffman was arrested again. She was accused of singing out loud and [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]], and was released from police custody the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenofthewall.org.il/media-3/press-room-2/, Women of the Wall website]&lt;/ref&gt; The following morning Lesley Sachs and board member Rachel Cohen Yeshurun were detained for "disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://972mag.com/breaking-3-women-arrested-while-praying-at-western-wall-in-last-24-hours/57856/|title=3 women arrested while praying at Western Wall in 24 hours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman described the ordeal: "In the past when I was detained I had to have a policewoman come with me to the bathroom, but this was something different.  This time they checked me naked, completely, without my underwear. They dragged me on the floor 15 meters; my arms are bruised. They put me in a cell without a bed, with three other prisoners, including a prostitute and a car thief.  They threw the food through a little window in the door. I laid on the floor covered with my [[tallit]].  I'm a tough cookie, but I was just so miserable. And for what? I was with the [[Hadassah]] women saying Sh'ma Yisrael."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Jeremy.

On February 11, 2013, ten women who were part of WOW, including two American rabbis, were detained for praying at the wall and "as a result of them wearing the garments that they're not allowed to wear specifically at that site."&lt;ref name=nytfeb&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|title=Women Praying at Western Wall in Jerusalem Are Detained|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/Women-Praying-at-Western-Wall-Detained.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were barred from returning for 15 days.

On April 11, 2013, five women were detained for allegedly goading and offending other worshippers. They were subsequently released by Judge Sharon Larry-Bavili without restrictions as she ruled that the female worshippers did not instigate the disturbance, but rather it was the male and female Orthodox protestors countering them that initiated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=YItzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2015, Women of the Wall board member Rachel Cohen Yeshurun was arrested by police in the prayer section of the Kotel after smuggling in a Torah Scroll to the Kotel in the early morning before the Rosh Hodesh service began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/women-of-the-wall-member-arrested-at-western-wall-with-torah/ |title=Women of the Wall member arrested at Western Wall with Torah |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2015-07-18 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1:19 pm |url=http://www.womenofthewall.org.il/women-of-the-wall-leader-arrested-with-a-torah-in-the-womens-section/ |title=Leader Arrested with a Torah in the Women's Section |publisher=Women of the Wall |date=2015-07-17 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2016, Women of the Wall Executive Director Leslie Sachs was detained by police for 'smuggling' a Torah into the Kotel, and according to a statement released by Women of the Wall detained for 'disturbing the public order'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/police-hold-women-of-the-wall-leader-for-smuggling-torah/ |title=Police hold Women of the Wall leader for 'smuggling Torah' |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2016-06-07 |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2018, several Women of the Wall board members were briefly detained outside the Western Wall plaza by police demanding to see their ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nachshoni |first=Kobi |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5287506,00.html/ |title=Women of the Wall defy AG's ruling, leading to clashes |publisher=Ynet |date=2018-06-15 |accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women of the Wall's position==
The Women of the Wall have consistently claimed that there is no single "custom of the place" and that their right to pray is a religious freedom enshrined in Israeli law. They believe the Western Wall is a religious site as well as a national site and therefore belongs to the entire Jewish population. Their efforts to challenge the current customs at the Wall and break the ritual status quo continues as they believe that the Wall is a holy place for all Jews. They repeatedly stress that the group is not Reform Jews, but come from all affiliations and that their conduct strictly adheres to Orthodox Jewish Law and that their prayer is genuine and not a political stunt. Their central mission is to "achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall."  The women have made progress and as of 1988, the women have held occasional, uninterrupted prayer services wearing tallitot and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Orthodox establishment's position==
The Israeli Orthodox Jewish religious establishment is opposed to the services conducted by the Women of the Wall. Orthodox rabbis claim that even if such a manner of prayer is theoretically permitted by Jewish Law, it is against Jewish custom. Even if support can be found in Jewish legal sources for various activities, the force of custom is equal to absolute law and it is the custom which determines proper conduct. Various legal opinions recorded in Halacha cannot be manipulated to introduce new forms of prayer.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|pp=638–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], which is cited by Women of the Wall in support of their cause, is rejected by the establishment, as they view the Women of the Wall as being motivated by feminism rather than a sincere spiritual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Frimer, Arye and Dov, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm Women's Prayer Services Theory and Practice] ''Tradition'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Their struggle is also seen as an attempt to undermine their influence and as a strategy for non-Orthodox groups to gradually gain official recognition at state level, paving the way for the introduction of religious pluralism in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012|p=}}: "The Israeli Orthodox establishment view the Women of the Wall as being a Trojan horse to introduce Jewish pluralism and establish the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist strains of Judaism in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to the group, [[Yehuda Getz]], the government appointed rabbi of the Western Wall, urged them to stop "straying from the hallowed traditions of generations of Jews before you"&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"/&gt; and in 1989, the Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Avraham Shapiro]] and the Religious Affairs Minister suggested that the women "pray individually, silently, and preferably at home-not at the wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
From the outset, the Women of the Wall have been subjected to heckling and abuse from male and female Orthodox worshipers. More recently, the extremists who oppose the Women of the Wall have been criticized by Israel's predominantly secular society, which objects not only to the religious extremists' harassment of Women of the Wall but attempts to ban mixing of genders in public places such buses and sidewalks.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

In 1996, UTJ MK [[Israel Eichler]] wrote: "No one prevents anyone else from praying at the wall in his own fashion, but the wall is the last place to carry out a battle for the right of a woman to wear a ''tallit'', read from the Torah, wear a ''kippa'' and grow a beard."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2000|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MK [[Yaakov Litzman]] stated that "there is no desecration greater than that of women who come to desecrate the holiness of the Western Wall with all kinds of provocations such as carrying a Torah scroll and other things reserved by Jewish law only to men"&lt;ref name= LAT2000&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/05/news/mn-37770 Israeli Women Defy Custom, Say a Prayer for Equality], June 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ovadia Yosef said: "There are stupid women who come to the Western Wall, put on a tallit (prayer shawl), and pray... These are deviants who serve equality, not Heaven. They must be condemned and warned of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3801872,00.html|title=Rabbi Yosef condemns Women of the Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]] suggested that it is "not religious need," but rather "religious politics" which motivates the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirsch|Reinman|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Orthodox women have also disapproved of the group. [[Nehama Leibowitz]] likened their worship to a form of "sport,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unterman|2009|p=296}}: "Nehama rejected the argument that women's spiritual needs must be met more fully than convention currently allows. Shira Leibowitz Schmidt recalls that Nehama "unsympathetically labeled as "sport" the untraditional, demonstrative prayer by Women of the Wall..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the widow of  Sephardi Chief Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] said the group had "gone completely mad" and their actions amount to "desecration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/168688 Rabbanit Tzviya Eliyahu: Women of the Wall are 'Crazy'], ''Arutz Sheva'', (June 06, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-Orthodox former Jerusalem city councilwoman Mina Fenton said the women are "a fringe group that attracts people who read the prayer book upside down."&lt;ref name=USA10-05/&gt; The Religious Zionist leadership also voiced its concern in May 2013 when a group of influential rabbis issued a letter calling on public figures "not to let a small group offend the thousands of worshippers arriving to pray at this sacred place on a regular basis." They went on to state that "there are those who have been trying in recent years to change the present situation, offending many and tainting the special atmosphere of holiness of this sacred place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4378184,00.html Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall], Kobi Nachshoni, ''ynet.com'' 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval included a wide range of name-calling, with Women of the Wall being called "witches," "prostitutes," "weird," "childish," and "provocateurs," for wanting to pray in their fashion. The Israeli state and Ministry of Religion referred to Women of the Wall as "witches," who were doing "Satan's work"; "more like prostitutes than women"; "misled, tainted, by modern secular feminism."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet indifference and condemnation for the women's plight came from all sectors of Israeli society, not just from the religious right. Even liberals saw their actions as a "provocation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2009|p=231}}: "However, even academics, intellectuals, and journalists generally committed to a liberal point of view were overtly hostile to the WOW. In newspaper articles and public discussion, they claimed that their actions were a "provocation."&lt;/ref&gt; and women's organisations in Israel viewed their behaviour as "weird and objectionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naveh|2003|p=130}}: "The WoW group has also failed to rally support from Israeli women's organizations: their struggle was and is still considered weird and objectionable."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillel Halkin]] called them "childish provocateurs"&lt;ref&gt;Halkin, Hillel.

Interestingly, their stance has not been overly sympathetic to the Women of the Wall,..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Klotz|1989}}: "The Israeli secular public cannot see why this issue is important to us."&lt;/ref&gt; possibly reflecting a general hostility to feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halperin-Kaddari|2004|p=170}}: "Significantly, there has been little sympathy or understanding in the media for the women's cause, perhaps expressing Israeli society's general hostility to feminist causes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "I fear that the general indifference at best, and hostility at worst, of the Jewish secular majority towards the Women of the Wall stems from the hostility to feminism in general. It has long been observed that feminism has not been kindly accepted in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Starr Sered|Susan Sered]] suggests the public saw the group as "symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|1999|p=211}}: "The Women of the Wall are themselves seen as a symbol, symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site."&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that many in Israel saw the group as "American Reform interlopers trying to appropriate a state symbol of national identity."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"/&gt; Their demands were seen as radical and foreign to Israeli society&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|Safir|1991|p=16}}: "In the context of Israeli society, the demands of Women of the Wall represent unprecedented, radical demands. Jews in Israel, including the secular majority, generally accept the domination of Orthodoxy in religious matters, perhaps because they do not perceive it as meaningful to their daily lives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2006|p=133}}: "In Israel of the early 1990s, which experienced the surge of religion and the rise of religious political power, WOW's action was perceived as radical and unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; and their actions "alienated Israelis of almost all political persuasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the women at first received minimal [[grass-roots]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1999|p=157}}: "There has not been as much grass-roots support in Israel for the Women of the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt;  Lahav explains that secular indifference results from an acceptance of the view espoused by the Orthodox establishment when it comes to religious issues&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "A deeper reason has to do with the historical attitude of secular Zionism towards religion. From the perspective of the secular majority, Jewish religion is what the orthodox say it is. They fail to see in the women's fight a struggle to open up orthodoxy and make it more egalitarian; if they do, they do not consider it to be of any significance because they do not have an interest in religion anyway."&lt;/ref&gt; and that those on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] of the political spectrum ignore the women in an attempt to gain Orthodox support for their dovish positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "Politically, the secular majority is interested in the orthodox sector only in as much as it can support their views concerning the peace process. The Left is impatient with the Women of the Wall because they pose yet another obstacle on the road to some Orthodox support of the dovish resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Right supports the orthodox (against the women) because it wishes to strengthen its bond with the religious sector, thereby guaranteeing more support for it hawkish opposition to the formula of land for peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the women initially came mainly from Reform and Liberal communities in North America. In 1990, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] encouraged its members to support Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1990|p=160}}: "Therefore be, it resolved that the CCAR encourage its members and their constituencies to support the Women of the Wall by writing to the Ministers of Religion and Justice, the Prime Minister, the Chief rabbis, public figures, and President of Israel about... b) Women having the option of joining prayer groups at the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] declared it "warmly commends the Women of the Wall for its courageous and principled struggle to be allowed to pray at the Western Wall" and urged Reform congregations to "express solidarity with the Women of the Wall in appropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://urj.org//about/union/governance/reso//?syspage=article&amp;item_id=1945 In Support of Women of the Wall], URJ, (June 4, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a number of non-Orthodox gatherings and services have been held publicly in America in solidarity with the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/132071/nyc-prayer-service-supports-women-of-the-wall NYC Prayer Service Supports Women of the Wall], ''Tablet, (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Reform movement, WOW has faced both support and criticism. Rabbi [[Gilad Kariv]], who is considered the leader of the Reform movement in Israel, argued that WOW's request of 11 hours a year{{clarify|date=December 2017}} did not indicate an urgency that required a change in policy, but he came to support WOW's goals because they align with the Reform movement's opposition to the exclusion of women from religious society in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2013, however, about half of Israeli Jews approved of Women of the Wall and their mission, with the greatest support coming from educated Ashkenazi Jews. Pollsters for the Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) and Tel Aviv University surveyed Jews in Israel and found that a clear majority, 64%, of those who defined themselves as secular, and 53% of those who described themselves as traditional but not religious supported the right of Women of the Wall to worship in their fashion. A minority of those who described themselves as traditional religious or Ultra-Orthodox approved. The results showed that overall,  51.8% of men and 46% of women supported Women of the Wall and their right to pray in their fashion at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-half-of-israeli-jews-back-women-of-the-wall/ Almost half of Israeli Jews back Women of the Wall] Times of Israel, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinions==
Some Jewish feminist activists in Israel have seen the Women of the Wall's activities as being inconsistent with their political activities. Leah Shakdiel of the anti-war group [[Women in Black]] describes the Wall as "all maleness and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakdiel maintains that Israeli society's general opposition to the Women of the Wall is a result of a religious and secular alliance against what they perceive as a feminist challenge. Ran Hirschl believes the conflict is "a contest for cultural hegemony between a secularist-libertarian elite and traditionally peripheral group," namely the ultra-Orthodox community. [[Frances Raday]] posits that the violent opposition by Orthodox Jews stems from the "desire of the Orthodox establishment to preserve religious patriarchal hegemony against the challenge of religious feminism," rather than an attempt to preserve Jewish Law itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Chesler]] of Women of the Wall wrote: "We asked for our rights under civil and religious law. When we prayed, other worshipers, both men and women, verbally and physically assaulted us. We asked the Israeli state to protect us so that we could exercise our rights. The state claimed it could not contain the violence against us, and that we ourselves had provoked the violence by "disturbing/offending" the "sensibilities of Jews at worship." Women are not seen as "Jews" or as "worshipers" with "sensibilities."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"/&gt;

The '''World Index of Moral Freedom'''&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.fundalib.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/World-Index-of-Moral-Freedom-web.pdf World Index of Moral Freedom (WIMF)]'''&lt;/ref&gt; is an international index ranking one hundred and sixty countries on their performance on five categories of indicators: '''religious freedom''' (taking into account both the freedom to practice any religion or none, and the situation of religious control on the state); '''bioethical freedom''' (including the legal status of abortion, euthanasia and other practices pertaining to bioethics, like surrogacy or stem cell research); '''drugs freedom''' (including the legal status of cannabis and the country's general policy on hard drugs); '''sexual freedom''' (including the legal status of pornography and sex services among consenting adults, and the country's age of sexual consent), and '''family and gender freedom''' (including women's freedom of movement, the legal status of cohabitation of unmarried couples, same sex marriage and the situation of transgender people). The index is sponsored and published by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty, a [[libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The WIMF's first edition was published on April 2, 2016, co-authored by Foundation researchers Andreas Kohl and Juan Pina. A second edition was published by the same foundation in July, 2018, this time authored by Juan Pina and Emma Watson.

== Purpose ==
The World Index of Moral Freedom aims at completing the views presented by other international [[freedom indices]] measuring general freedom or aspects thereof (press freedom, economic freedom, etcetera). To do so, the Index aims at responding a simple question: how free from state-imposed moral constraints are human beings depending on their countries of residence? The research conducted tries to determine the degree of individual freedom to take decisions pertaining to the great moral debates of our time. The first edition of the WIMF includes a short note on the comparison between its country ranking and those of the other freedom indices.

== Categories studied and classification of countries ==
Each category of indicators is worth twenty points (20% of the total score) and aims at responding the following questions:
* '''''Category A.''''' Religious indicators. How free is the practice of any religion or none, and how religious-controlled is the state.
* '''''Category B.''''' Bioethical indicators. How free is individual decision making on matters posing bioethical questions.
* '''''Category C.''''' Drugs indicators. How free is the production, trade and consumption of substances deemed harmful.
* '''''Category D.''''' Sexuality indicators. How free are sexual intercourse, pornography and sex services among consenting adults.
* '''''Category E.''''' Gender &amp; family indicators. How free are women, LGBT individuals and unmarried couples living together.

Each category is made up of various indicators (normally one or two leading indicators adjusted by one or two lesser wheighted ones), the weight of which is set in view of their inferred relevance towards the category's overall score. Countries have been classified towards each category according to the information available in the sources reviewed. All category results and the general index itself are presented in a 0-100 point scale. Countries are classified according to the following intervals:
* 90-100 points – ''Highest moral freedom''
* 80-90 points – ''Very high moral freedom''
* 60-80 points – ''High moral freedom''
* 50-60 points – ''Acceptable moral freedom''
* 40-50 points – ''Insufficient moral freedom''
* 20-40 points – ''Low moral freedom''
* 10-20 points – ''Very low moral freedom''
* 0-10 points – ''Lowest moral freedom''

== Findings of the WIMF's first edition ==

=== State of moral freedom around the world ===
Only one country, the [[Netherlands]], is classified as having the "highest" level of moral freedom by scoring slightly over the 90 points required for that label. Just four countries make it into the upper twenty points, and only ten pass the 75 point threshold. Out of the 160 countries considered, only 64 "pass the exam" and score 50 points or more. And around 30% of all countries fall in the "low", "very low" or "lowest" moral freedom areas of the index. Technology and the cultural globalization that it produces are deemed by the authors to be the most powerful driving forces towards acceptance of individual moral freedom.

=== Netherlands ===
With a three-point (three per cent) advantage over their closest competitor and eight points over the third, the Netherlands top the 2016 country ranking. The Dutch score is twenty-one points higher than the average of all countries enjoying "high" or "very high" moral freedom. For many decades, whenever moral freedom was discussed, the Netherlands had the least interventionist policies. The first country to fight [[human trafficking]] by legalising sex services performed by [[consenting adults]], or to normalize the use of [[cannabis]], or to acknowledge [[same sex marriage]] already in 2001, performs remarkably high in most indicators considered towards the index.

=== Latin countries ===
A trend may be inferred towards international unification of the legal and political approach to moral issues. And that trend favours the Western world's predominant choice for low moral interference by the state. This is particularly noticeable when looking at the index performance of many Southern European and [[Latin American]] countries, which seem to reveal a fast cultural evolution from traditional, conservative values into a laissez-faire approach to morality. Four of the top ten countries are Latin American or Iberian, while six other Latin countries in Southern Europe and the Americas make it to the "high moral freedom" region of the index. The particular performance of countries like [[Portugal]] or [[Uruguay]] is much higher than their recent history would indicate. These and other Latin countries seem to have discarded their traditional background of religiously influenced governance.

=== Islamic countries and other religious-influenced states ===
The fifteen lowest scoring countries at the World Index of Moral Freedom are [[Islamic]] and located in the [[Persian Gulf]], North-Eastern [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. This is also true for the region's economically free enclaves in the area. [[Saudi Arabia]] comes last (160th) in the ranking and doesn't even score ten points out of the one hundred potentially available. Only four predominantly Islamic countries obtain more than fifty points: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. A few non Islamic countries also show low levels of moral freedom which the authors consider likely to be due to a strong political leverage held by another [[religion]]. These include [[Belarus]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]), [[Israel]] ([[Jewish]]), [[Nepal]] ([[Hinduist]]), the [[Philippines]] ([[Catholic]]), [[Thailand]] ([[Buddhist]]), [[Tonga]] ([[Methodist]]), or [[Tuvalu]] ([[Calvinist]]).

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], moral [[conservatism]], derived from either the Orthodox faith or traditional culture, seems to have replaced [[marxism]] as the basis for an ongoing, though softer, social engineering by the state. Russia's score is just in the middle of the classification, a position shared by some of her cultural and political allies, like [[Serbia]] or [[Moldova]], while politically unfree [[Belarus]] falls further below. In all of these countries, the freedom of [[LGBT]] individuals is a matter of particular concern.

=== Communist countries ===
The remaining [[communist]] regimes coerce their citizens into abiding by a moral code based on allegedly scientific views. Freedom of conscience and the practice of any religion are repressed. In the case of the [[People's Republic of China]], decades of limited economic liberalization have not resulted in an equally noticeable moral openness. Two other communist regimes, [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], fall further down into the low moral freedom area, while moral freedom is deemed insufficient in [[Laos]] and just slightly over the fifty point threshold in socialist [[Venezuela]] or in outright communist [[Cuba]].

=== Other findings ===
For different reasons, often including abnormally low scores in a particular set of indicators, a few Western countries which perform reasonably high in other freedom indices rank rather low at the WIMF. [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] fail to make it into the "high moral freedom" area, although just for under half a point. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] performance is particularly low within the moral freedom area. [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] barely manage to pass the fifty point mark, while [[Singapore]], [[Israel]] or [[South Korea]] fall in the "insufficient moral freedom" part of the index. While most countries topping the WIMF in its first edition belong to the [[developed world]], some countries with a lesser degree of development have also made their way into the higher classification areas. [[Cambodia]], scoring just over seventy points, obtains the fifteenth place in the global classification and is the first developing country in the index. It is also worth noting that the four European micro-states considered −the principalities of [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] and the republics of [[San Marino]] and [[Malta]]− score surprisingly low in comparison with their bigger neighbours. In spite of their high [[living standards]] and [[economic freedom]], these countries fail to perform similarly when it comes to moral freedom. A similar situation is observed in Caribbean and South Pacific island micro-states, which score poorly in most categories and rank in the lower areas of the WIMF classification. This similarity between very small countries in different regions, in spite of the cultural influence of their neighbours and allies, may lead to the conclusion that moral freedom is affected, among other relevant factors, by country size.

E. Tuttle Co.|location=Rutland, Vermont|isbn=9780804819657|pages=134, 346|edition=Classic}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a traditional Japanese mysticism, Yamabushi are believed to be endowed with supernatural powers. They follow the [[Shugendō]] doctrine, an integration of mainly [[Vajrayana|esoteric Buddhism]] of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] sect, with [[Tendai]] Buddhist, [[Taoism]], and elements of [[Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tofugu.com/japan/yamabushi-japanese-mountain-people/|title=Japanese Mountain Folk|last=Hashi|website=Tofugu|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source is a blog.|date=October 2017}} For the most part solitary, they did form loose confederations, and associations with certain temples, and also participated in battles and skirmishes alongside ''[[samurai]]'' and ''[[sōhei]]'' warrior monks on certain occasions. Their origins can be traced back to the solitary [[Yama-bito]] and some '''''hijiri''''' (聖) of the eighth and ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blacker|first1=Carmen|title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|date=1999|publisher=Japan Library|location=Richmond, Virginia|isbn=1873410859|pages=165-167|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been cross-teaching with samurai weaponry and Yamabushi's spiritual approach to life and fighting.{{Or|date=May 2017}}

In modern use, the term ''ubasoku-yamabushi'' refers to laymen practitioners of shugendō.{{Citation needed lead|date=May 2017}} The religion places a heavy emphasis on asceticism and feats of endurance, and white and saffron-robed ''yamabushi'' toting a ''[[horagai]]'' conch-shell trumpet are still a common sight near the shugendō holy site of [[Dewa Sanzan]] and in the sacred mountains of Kumano and Omine.{{Citation needed lead|date=May 2017}}

==History==
''Yamabushi'' began as ''yamahoshi'', isolated clusters (or individuals) of mountain hermits, ascetics, and "holy men", who followed the path of ''shugendō'', a search for spiritual, mystical, or supernatural powers gained through asceticism. This path may or may not have had a founder, as the myths surrounding [[En no Gyōja]] are numerous and complex; he is quite similar to a Japanese [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] in this way. Men who followed this path came to be known by a variety of names, including ''kenja'', ''kenza'', and ''[[shugenja]]''. These mountain mystics came to be renowned for their magical abilities and [[occult]] knowledge, and were sought out as healers or mediums, although [[Shinto shrines]] had traditionally reserved this role exclusively for maidens known as [[Miko]].

Most of these ascetics, in addition to their devotion to ''shugendō'', studied the teachings of the [[Tendai]] sect of Buddhism, or the Shingon sect, established by [[Kūkai|Kōbō Daishi]] in the 8th century. [[Shingon|Shingon Buddhism]] was one of the primary sects of ''mikkyō'' (密教) or [[Esoteric Buddhism]], according to which enlightenment is found through isolation, and the study and contemplation of oneself, as well as nature, and esoteric images called [[mandala]]. Both the Shingon sect and the Tendai viewed mountains as the ideal place for this sort of isolation and contemplation of nature.

In their mountain retreats, these monks studied not only nature and religious/spiritual texts and images, but also a variety of martial arts. Whether they felt they had to defend themselves from bandits, other monks, or samurai armies is questionable, but the idea of studying martial arts as a means to improve oneself mentally and spiritually, not just physically, has always been central to Japanese culture, beyond the specific tenets of one religious sect or another. Additionally, the Yamabushi developed their own forms of cooking that utilized vegetation that was naturally found on the mountains where they trained.  This cuisine allowed them to spend weeks or even months in the mountains without having to venture down into the towns or cities below to restock on supplies. Thus, like the ''sōhei'', the ''yamabushi''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehiddenjapan.com/yamabushi|title=Yamabushi Mountain Monks Of Yamagata|website=Yamagata {{!}} Shonai {{!}} The Hidden Japan|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; became warriors as well as monks.

As their reputation for mystical insight and knowledge grew, and their organization grew tighter, many of the masters of the ascetic disciplines began to be appointed to high spiritual positions in the court hierarchy. Monks and temples began to gain political influence. By the [[Nanboku-chō]] Period, in the 13th and 14th centuries, the ''yamabushi'' had formed organized cohorts called ''konsha'', &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yamabushi.org.uk/yamabushi.html|title=Yamabushi Page|website=Yamabushi Judo Club|accessdate=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=yes|reason=Source appears to be a self-published site.|date=October 2017}} and these ''konsha'', along with ''sōhei'' and other monks began to take direction from the central temples of their sects. They assisted [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] in his attempts to overthrow the [[Kamakura shogunate]], and proved their warrior skills to be up to the challenge of fighting professional samurai armies.

Several centuries later, in the [[Sengoku Period]], ''yamabushi'' could be found among the advisers and armies of nearly every major contender for dominion over [[Japan]]. Some, led by [[Takeda Shingen]], aided [[Oda Nobunaga]] against [[Uesugi Kenshin]] in 1568, while others, including the abbot [[Sessai Choro]], advised [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Many fought alongside their fellow monks, the ''[[Ikkō-ikki]]'', against [[Oda Nobunaga|Nobunaga]], who eventually crushed them and put an end to the time of the warrior monks.

Yamabushi also served as ''sendatsu'', or spiritual mountain guides, since medieval times for pilgrims along the [[Kumano Kodo]] to the Kumano Sanzan, including retired emperors and aristocrats.
