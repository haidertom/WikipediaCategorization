[[File:Kjelkeoverisen.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Fridtjof Nansen]] reached a record latitude of 86°14′ during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|North Pole expedition]] of 1893–96. ]]

An '''adventure''' is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes [[risk]]y, undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]] or participating in [[extreme sports]].

==Motivation==
Adventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[wikt:excitement|excitement]]: examples are [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

==Adventure in mythology and fiction==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1996-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[knight errant]] was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.

The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature [[Adventure film|films]], such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html|title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny|author=Vincent Canby|date=26 May 1977|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark|author=Vincent Canby|date=12 June 1981|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Carroll, Robinson - S001 - Cover.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' is a well-known example of a fantasized adventure story.]]

===Outdoors===
Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the [[wilderness]] or [[Mother Nature]]. Examples include books such as [[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]] or [[My Side of the Mountain]]. These books are less about "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

===Questing===
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.

===Video games===
{{See also|Adventure game}}
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
Many [[video games]] are adventure games.

==Adventure in nonfiction==
From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as [[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]] by [[Tom Wolfe]], or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by [[Lionel Terray]]. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

==Adventure sports==
There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include [[mountain climbing]], [[skydiving]], or other [[extreme sports]].

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes.

An '''audition''' is a sample performance by an [[actor]], [[singer]], [[musician]], [[dancer]] or other performer. It typically involves the performer displaying their talent through a previously memorized and rehearsed solo piece or by performing a work or piece given to the performer at the audition or shortly before. In some cases, such as with a model or acrobat, the individual may be asked to demonstrate a range of professional skills. Actors may be asked to present a [[monologue]]. Singers will perform a [[song]] in a popular music context or an [[aria]] in a Classical context. A dancer will present a routine in a specific style, such as ballet, tap dance or hip-hop, or show his or her ability to quickly learn a choreographed dance piece.

The audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals select performers, which is in some ways analogous to a [[job interview]] in the regular job market. In an audition, the employer is testing the ability of the applicant to meet the needs of the job and assess how well the individual will take directions and deal with changes. After some auditions, after the performer has demonstrated their abilities in a given performance style, the audition panel may ask a few questions that resemble those used in standard job interviews (e.g., regarding availability).

Auditions are required for many reasons in the performing arts world. Often, employing companies or groups use auditions to select performers for upcoming shows or productions. An audition for a performing opportunity may be for a single performance (e.g., doing a monologue at a comedy club), for a series or season of performances (a season of a Broadway play), or for [[permanent employment]] with the performing organization (e.g., an orchestra or dance troupe). Auditions for performing opportunities may be for amateur, school, or community organizations, in which case the performers will typically not be paid. As well, auditions are used to select or screen candidates for entry to training programs (ballet school or circus school); university programs ([[B.Mus]], [[M.Mus]], [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Theater); performance-related scholarships and grants; or to be considered for representation by a talent agency or individual agent.

==Actors==
[[File:Владимир Назаров.jpg|thumb|For actors, monologues and speeches are the "calling card" that they use to demonstrate their skills to casting directors.]]

For actors in theater, film, and TV, the "audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals make final casting decisions.  Industry professionals may consist of casting directors, producers, directors or agency representatives".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auditionmonologues.com/Audition%20Tips.html|title=Audition Tips Monologues Actors Kids Teens Women Men|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In film and television, the audition is called a [[screen test]], and it is filmed so that the casting director or director can see how the actor appears on screen. Auditions are advertised in major media outlets (such as newspaper or radio), industry magazines and newsletters (e.g., auditions for musicians are advertised in the American Federation of Musicians newsletter), audition websites, and through a talent/casting agencies. Some performers hire an agent, to be able to draw on the agent's connections with casting directors and performing arts companies. However, the agent will take a cut (often 10–20%) of the performer's earnings. Although an actor's talents comprise crucial criteria in the casting process, an almost equal amount of attention is given to an actor's "type", (a combination of personality, looks and general casting intuition) as required for a particular production.

Actors who are selecting an audition piece may select a monologue by a character who is close to their own age. They may wear neutral clothing that allows freedom of movement. Auditionees may avoid going over the stated time limit. By convention, some actors choose to not direct their speech to the audition panel if they are doing an on-stage audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716210917/http://www.ubishops.ca/ccc/div/hum/dra/audition.html |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the audition panel may request that the auditionee interacts with them (e.g., a director may ask the actor to speak the lines while looking directly at the director). An actor who is doing an audition may warm up before the audition, like an athlete would, although with an actor, a warm up might include vocal exercises in addition to stretching. Just as with any interview outside of the performing arts world, an auditionee may dress well. Even if the auditionee does not have expensive clothing, simple clothing may be acceptable if it is clean and of good quality. Auditionees know casting directors are also considering "whether or not the actor will be easy to work with, that they know what they are doing and can take direction well".&lt;ref name="auditionmonologues.com"/&gt;

Audition pieces are not always from the show the actor is being considered for; an actor wishing to be cast in ''[[Hamlet]]'' may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do have a range of audition pieces and select something appropriate; an actor auditioning for ''Hamlet'' would have a dramatic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an [[Oscar Wilde]] [[comedy]], or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character).

For most auditions, it is expected that auditionees will bring a professional 8"x10" photo called a "head shot" and a resume that indicates their acting experience and training. Actors may bring additional copies of the head shot and resume, in case there are additional members of the casting team present at the audition. The casting agent or company may "call back" an auditionee days, weeks, or even months after the initial audition for a second audition. At a major audition for a professional company, the time limits are strictly enforced. A musical theater performer may be given a moment to tell the piano accompanist the tempo, and state their name and audition number to the audition panel. Then, once the auditionee starts acting or singing, the clock starts running. A buzzer sounds when the time limit runs out, which may be a minute and a half, two minutes, or three minutes, depending on the company. At this point, the auditionee is expected to stop and leave to free up the stage for the next auditionee.

Right before the audition, the casting director may give new instructions that were not in the advertisement; for example, due to time constraints, the time limit for the monologues might be cut in half, or the vocal selections might be cut. Actors know that it is important that they follow these last-minute instructions, and not be "thrown off balance" by these changes. At an audition, a director may ask for changes in the delivery of the lines or in other aspects of the performance. The goal may be to see if the auditionee is versatile or because the director disagrees with the initial approach used by the auditionee. In either case, the behavior of the auditionee is important; if the auditionee is cooperative in making the changes, it shows that he or she will be easy to work with. If a script is provided beforehand, actors often try to memorize as much as possible, because this shows that they have prepared and it allows them to look up from the script and show their facial expressions more.

Film auditions are different from theatre auditions. For film auditions, actors and actresses are given "sides" which are often a few pages of the script with the roles that they are auditioning for. These sides are often given to the actors 1–3 days before the audition.

In 2015, the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive video cameras has made video recordings of auditions feasible. To find their talent, casting directors are able to request video auditions from actors and actresses from a different state or country.

==Music==

===Popular music===

====Instrumentalists====
[[File:Wolfgang Schmid Unterfahrt-OhWeh-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play basslines from a range of different styles.]]
In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, instrumentalists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music at various levels of difficulty. In jazz groups, auditionees may be asked to perform standard pieces (e.g., a [[jazz standard]] such as "Now's the Time") with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play a rock or blues standard. An auditionee for a [[rhythm section]] role (rhythm guitar, electric bass, drumkit, etc.) will be asked to play a range of standard styles or "feels" which are used in a given style. For example, a drummer applying to play in a jazz band might be asked to play a slow [[ballad]], a medium "standard", and an up-tempo swing style. A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play in a [[Motown]] style [[bassline]], a syncopated 1970s [[funk]] "slapping" style line, and a [[reggae]]-style bassline. A person auditioning for a role as a rhythm section member in some styles of music may be expected to be able to demonstrate the ability to perform as a backup singer.

A performer auditioning for a solo or "lead" instrument role will typically perform prepared solos that showcase a range of skills, including the ability to perform a melody with sensitivity and expression; the ability to play virtuosic passages; and, in some styles (e.g., fusion jazz or blues), the ability to [[improvise]] a melody over a chord progression. In some popular genres, there is relatively less emphasis on "stage presence" and movement onstage, such as classic [[jazz]] or traditional 1950s-style country music. In these styles, there is more of a focus on the sound of the music and the expressiveness of the performer with their voice or instrument. In other genres, such as heavy metal "[[shred guitar]]" or [[hardcore punk]], it may be very important that a performer can move about in a dramatic fashion onstage. One of the differences between instrumentalist auditions in rock music styles and Classical styles is that in a rock context, the performers will be expected to have memorized most or all of the music. In a Classical context, most or all of the music is read from sheet music (with the exception of a solo Bach suite movement or a solo concerto movement).

====Singers====
[[File:Irving Berlin Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Irving Berlin]], [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], and [[Helen Tamiris]] watching music theater auditions]]
For rock, country, and other forms of popular music, auditions are used to test the ability of an instrumentalist or singer to perform a specific style of music, or several styles. A singer auditioning for a role in a [[musical theatre]] production would not, unless instructed otherwise, need to sing [[opera]] or [[country music]], and a musician auditioning for a seat in an [[orchestra]] would not perform [[rock (music)|rock]].  Occasionally a musical theatre audition may require the performer to sing a song in the [[music genre|genre]] to which the musical pertains.  For instance, a singer auditioning for ''[[Destry Rides Again (musical)|Destry Rides Again]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[country-western]] song. A person auditioning for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' may be asked to sing a standard [[rock music|rock]] song.  As well, in some cases, an audition may require a performer to demonstrate pieces in several styles. A hard rock band auditioning a new singer may request that the individual perform songs from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and related styles such as [[blues rock]]. A pop or rock band that is selecting a new lead singer that has whittled the number of applicants down to the top two or three singers may test out how the singers perform in live shows by performing a few live concerts with each guest singer. This allows the band to see how the singer performs in a full multi-hour concert, including how well the singer can develop a rapport with the audience, deal with the inevitable problems that occur in live music (e.g., microphones failing or stage lights malfunctioning), and maintain their vocal endurance until the end of the evening.

[[File:ESC 2007 Denmark - DQ - Drama Queen.jpg|thumb|A contestant in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] tries to impress the judges at her live audition]]
For smaller roles in a large musical theater production, mass auditions are held at which many inexperienced or aspiring performers, most without [[talent agent|agents]], show up. These are popularly known as "cattle calls", since the hopefuls are often kept together in one large room. The musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' depicts this type of audition. ''[[American Idol]]'' also auditions its aspiring [[vocalists]] using this technique, since there are so many auditions. In musical theater and in pop music styles for which onstage dancing is part of the performance (e.g., hip hop), singers who are doing a vocal audition may also be required to demonstrate that they can dance while singing. In some popular music groups, such as a rock band, a [[backup singer]] may be expected to be able to play an instrument while singing, such as strumming a simple [[rhythm guitar]] part or playing a percussion instrument (e.g., tambourine or congas). While an ability to sing in multiple languages with the appropriate diction and pronunciation is more associated with Classical music than popular music, there are some popular styles where multiple languages are expected, including Latin jazz styles such as [[Bossa Nova]] (Portuguese songs may be requested); Tango (Spanish songs may be requested); folk music (French songs may be requested); and [[Celtic music]] (Irish songs may be requested).

===Classical music===
In classical music, auditions are used to screen candidates for positions as instrumentalists in chamber groups or orchestras or as soloists, and to screen singers for positions as members of a choir or as solo performers. In classical music, auditions are also used to screen candidates for entry to training programs, university or Conservatory programs or degrees, and training festival activities (e.g., classical summer camps). In comparison with some types of pop music auditions, classical auditions tend to be much more formal. The performer may, by tradition, wear a tuxedo or a formal dress, and the judges may sit behind a desk and write comments on clipboards.

====Instrumentalists====

In classical music, each instrument or vocal type has a standard repertoire of music which is commonly requested at auditions. Instrumentalists in an orchestral context are typically asked to perform excerpts from the orchestral literature, including both exposed solos and "tutti" parts which are particularly demanding. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], and a number of Principal players from the orchestra. Since the post-WW II era, professional orchestra auditions often include a musician's union representative, who ensures that the audition is being run in a fair manner. In many major orchestras, a cloth screen may be used at some stages of the audition process, to protect the audition panel from allegations of favouritism or sexism.

An orchestral audition will normally set out a list of orchestral excerpts which each performer has to prepare. As well, each performer plays a movement from a Sonata or Concerto which may be performed with piano accompaniment. When the performer plays the orchestral excerpts, he or she may be given a tempo, or asked to follow the gestures of the conductor. Orchestral auditions are often run in several stages, in order to screen candidates and reduce those who are less likely to meet the needs of the job. A large number of applicants typically apply for a professional orchestra job. The orchestra personnel manager then selects the most promising candidates based on the experience and training indicated in the applicants' CVs (and, in some cases, based on the performing ability demonstrated in a recording of the applicant).

This first "cut" of auditionees then perform in front of the audition panel. Typically in a professional orchestra, this would require the performance of excerpts representing stylistic and technical challenges drawn from repertoire typical to that orchestra. The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music.

If a candidate is successful in passing the audition, typically a Trial period of several months to a year takes place allowing the Chief Conductor and Principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

====Singers====
There is a standard repertoire of vocal literature for each voice type (e.g., soprano, alto) that is used at auditions for singers. Each sub-type of vocal activity has a separate standard audition repertoire (e.g., choirs, operas, etc.). A person auditioning for a role in a choir will be expected to be able to sight read choral parts. In auditions for opera, a singer will be expected to demonstrate the ability to act out the movements that are associated with the lyrics of the aria, which may include pretending to be dying from a stab wound, miming an activity (e.g., pouring wine), or doing a simple dance routine. Both choral and opera singers are expected to be able to follow the gestures of a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] in regards to expression and tempo. Since microphones are not used in most classical music performances,&lt;ref&gt;The exception is [[acoustic enhancement]] systems which apply a subtle amplification in order to balance the volume in the hall and compensate for acoustic problems.&lt;/ref&gt; the audition panel will be assessing the auditionees ability to project a strong, room-filling vocal tone. In classical music, in addition to judging singing ability (e.g., tone, intonation, etc.), the audition panel will be judging the applicant's ability to use the appropriate diction and pronunciation of the major languages used in Art music: German, Italian, and French. Other languages that the applicant may be asked to sing in include English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin.

==Musical theatre==
In [[musical theatre]], a standard audition consists of two sixteen-measure selections of [[song]]s, contrasting in style, intention, characters, time period, or all of the above. There is also usually a monologue portion, where the actor is asked to perform a one-minute [[monologue]]. A headshot and résumé are almost always required. Although auditions vary depending on the theatre, program, or show, this formula is considered “the norm” in the musical theatre world. The purpose of an audition is two-fold. Practically, performers audition to get a callback. "Callbacks", or callback auditions, allow the artistic team to assess a performer’s skills in accordance with specific characters. During the callback, the panel has shortlisted a candidate, because they have noted his or her potential for particular parts. As such, during a callback audition, the candidate is asked to sing the songs performed by certain characters or read their lines. The first audition is not a platform for selling oneself as a particular character. Character-specific auditions take place during callbacks. Instead, the first audition is a chance for the performer to show off the songs she does best.

==Dance==
[[File:Two dancers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two dancers performing [[modern dance]], a style in which performers may be asked to demonstrate improvised movements at an audition.]]
There are many types of dance auditions for different performance venues. Dance companies hire employees for ballet and modern dance shows. Broadway companies hire dancers for traditional musicals (Rodgers and Hammerstein) and more modern dance musicals (e.g., ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''). Casinos, resorts, amusement parks, and cruise ships hire dancers for revue-style shows that can range from jazz dance to hip-hop. For these shows, some backup singing skills or acting skills may be required. Pop music concert producers and pop music video producers recruit dancers to perform onstage during concerts or during videos. For live pop concerts, onstage dancers may be required to perform simple backup singing. Movie and TV producers also hire dancers for short term shoots; even though a dancer may only get several days of work from a movie or TV show, there may be residual payments. Most auditions specify what type of dance skills are required (e.g., Classical, pointe, contemporary, jazz, hip-hop, etc.). In the case of modern dance, some dance companies ask applicants to demonstrate their ability to improvise dance moves.
[[File:Brazier Dancers 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|These dancers from the Braziers troupe are performing [[Highland dancing]], a style at which auditionees must demonstrate a high degree of technique and the ability to quickly learn new steps.]]
Many dance auditions test the ability of applicants to learning new [[choreography]] in a short time period, rather than showcasing a prepared work. In other cases, a short prepared solo piece may also be required (about 90 seconds long). Applicants will be instructed in a technical routine or pattern in a group session. Some auditions require applicants to have completed training at a recognised dance school or conservatoire, and in some cases, auditionees may be requested to bring a reference letter from a dance teacher or dance company director (especially in the case of young dancers with little professional experience). At some auditions, applicants are asked to make a short verbal statement about their dancing goals or why they wish to join the troupe. Auditionees should ensure that they know the major dance terms, because the judges may request that certain dance moves be demonstrated.

Dancers are often asked to bring one or two photographs, such as a "headshot" and a full-body photo of the applicant in a dancing pose. The clothing that auditionees need to wear at auditions varies. At some auditions, particularly Classical auditions, there is a strict dress code: applicants wear dance leotards and [[pointe shoes]], and long hair is tied back. Other dance auditions specify loose clothing. For some contemporary dance auditions, applicants must dance barefoot. In some music theater roles, applicants need to bring tap shoes to demonstrate their [[tap dancing]] skills. Some auditions where there is a large number of applicants require the performers to wear a number pinned to their shirt, in a similar way to marathon runners. This way, if the casting director sees an exceptional dancer, he or she can take note of the number. Unless jewellery or make-up is an expected part of a dancer's appearance in a certain dance style, dance auditionees generally avoid jewellery and makeup.

In music theater and pop music, there is a lot of crossover between dancing and singing roles. Almost all dancers in music theater and many dancers in pop music will be expected to have some singing ability as a [[backup singer]] (singing harmony parts to accompany the solo vocalists). In rarer cases, dancers will be asked to demonstrate the ability to play a musical instrument (e.g., guitar), because there are some shows in which some of the dancer-actors have to play instruments onstage, such as the ''[[Threepenny Opera]]''. In music theater, there is also often crossover between dancing and acting roles. Dancers may be expected to be able to take on an acting role and speak lines (often in a supporting role).

Some major dance companies have "open calls" once a year, in which any or almost any applicant can come to demonstrate their dancing skills. At these open calls, the entire group of applicants are taught a dance routine by a choreographer, and then the group of dancers performs the routine while judges assess their performance. It can be hard for a good dancer to get noticed by the judges in such a large group of dancers. For this reason, some dance coaches encourage their students to wear outgoing clothes and bright things to stand out, so that the dancer will get personal attention during his or her audition. For any audition interviews, dancers should send their resume and headshot to the company director ahead of time.

==Circuses and amusement parks==
[[File:Acrobat.jpg|thumb|A [[high wire]] act by an acrobat]]

Performers auditioning for amusement parks world wide are generally viewed by one or more casting directors in a rehearsal hall or a large facility. Most theme park auditions, like other auditions, are closed to the public. This means that no one is allowed into the audition room who is not auditioning. Vocalists for Disney auditions are asked to prepare two separate vocal selections of contrasting styles. The singers do not sing the entire songs; instead they just need to sing the best 16 bars of each song. Disney provides a piano accompanist for all vocal auditions, and so singers have to bring sheet music in the correct key. Disney does not allow any pre-recorded accompaniment. The casting directors may also ask auditionees to learn additional music or learn a movement combination. Disney Parks &amp; Resorts casts performers for theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/auditions/experience/prepare.html|title=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Cirque du Soleil]], depending on a performer's discipline, the audition may last an hour, a day or even two days. Depending on a performer's  discipline, he or she might have to perform a solo presentation in front of the group of participants and/or participate in individual and group exercises following the solo presentation. Auditions for Cirque du Soleil are filmed.

==Modeling==

[[Fashion model|Modelling]] agencies and other organizations that are looking for models, such as fashion designers and advertising agencies also use auditions to screen and select potential candidates. Aspiring female models for most fashion industry roles need to be in their teens or early twenties and be tall and slim. Although there are "niche markets" for non-svelte models ("plus size models" and "real life models" who model clothes for middle-market clothing catalogues), most female models need to be slender and between 108–125&amp;nbsp;lbs. Young men who are aspiring models should be between 18 and 25, tall, and fit. While male models who are selected at modelling auditions may well end up having careers that last till beyond age 25 (even into their 40s), modelling agencies prefer to recruit new models in the 18–25 age range. Most models work with an agent who arranges auditions, bookings, and negotiates fees. At an audition, casting agents will ask the model to demonstrate different poses, which a photographer may record with a digital camera.

For high fashion auditions, the model may be asked to demonstrate the "catwalk" style of modelling clothes on a raised runway. At most modelling auditions, models wear fairly simple clothes that will allow the talent agents to imagine the model in different garments. Typically, a model wears fairly body-hugging clothes, so that the judges can see the body type of the model. Some modelling agencies audition a large number of aspiring models in an "open call", in which agents consider applicants for under a minute or so each. Some agencies hold model searches, which is a type of beauty contest in which applicants audition for the opportunity of winning a model portfolio or a photo shoot.

[[Autism spectrum disorder]]s (''ASD''s) or autism spectrum conditions (''ASC''s) describe a range of conditions classified as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s in the [[DSM-5]], used by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name=DSM5Autism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Autism spectrum disorder fact sheet |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |work=DSM5.org |year=2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006210933/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many [[wikt:neurodivergent|neurodivergent]] people and conditions, the popular image of autistic people and autism itself is often based on inaccurate media representations.&lt;ref name=Trapped&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarrett|first=J C|title=Trapped children: popular images of children with autism in the 1960s and 2000s.|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|date=June 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=141–53|doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9135-z|pmid=21225325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MMR vaccine theory==
{{main article|MMR vaccine controversy#Media role}}
The MMR vaccine was the subject of controversy resulting from publication of a (now retracted) 1998 paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wakefield A, Murch S, Anthony A|author-link=Andrew Wakefield|title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet|volume=351|issue=9103|pages = 637–41|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0|pmid=9500320|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|accessdate= 5 September 2007|display-authors=etal}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|20137807}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been "dishonest";&lt;ref name=Irresponsible&gt;{{cite news|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|title=Andrew Wakefield found 'irresponsible' by GMC over MMR vaccine scare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/andrew-wakefield-mmr-vaccine|newspaper=The Guardian (London)|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the ''[[BMJ]]''.&lt;ref name=Fraud&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=342 |issue= |pages=c7452 |year=2011 |pmid=21209060 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |doi = 10.1136/bmj.c7452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2007 article in ''[[BMC Public Health]]'' postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had "created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against".&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K |title=Parents' champions vs. vested interests: who do parents believe about MMR?

''[[PRWeek]]'' noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.&lt;ref name=PRWeek&gt;[http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1007378/Reputation-survey-MMR-panic-subsides "Reputation Survey: MMR panic subsides."] ''[[PR Week]]'', 2 June 2010: 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but "now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=AgeOld&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poland GA, Jacobson RM |title= The Age-Old Struggle against the Antivaccinationists |journal= N Engl J Med |volume= 364 |issue= 2 |pages= 97–9 |date= 13 January 2011 |pmid= 21226573 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp1010594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the media in the sensationalization of the MMR vaccination issue was discussed by the ''[[BMJ]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science. Many other medical frauds have been exposed, but usually more quickly after publication and on less important health issues.&lt;ref name=Goldee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldee|first=F|title=The fraud behind the MMR scare|journal=British Medical Journal|date=January 2011|doi=10.1136/bmj.d22|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerns were also raised about the role of journalists reporting on scientific theories that they "are hardly in a position to question and comprehend.&lt;ref name=IBTimes&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/98531/20110107/link-between-mmr-vaccines-and-autism-conclusively-broken.htm |title= Link between MMR Vaccines and Autism conclusively broken |publisher= [[IB Times]] |date= 7 January 2011 |accessdate= 8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMDBroyd&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110106/bmj-declares-vaccine-autism-study-fraud |title= BMJ Declares Vaccine-Autism Study 'an Elaborate Fraud', 1998 Lancet Study Not Bad Science but Deliberate Fraud, Claims Journal |author= Broyd, Nicky |publisher= [[WebMD]] Health News |date= 6 January 2011 |accessdate =8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' labeled the controversy a "failure of journalism" that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that 1) ''The Lancet'' should not have published a study based on "statistically meaningless results" from only 12 cases; 2) the anti-vaccination crusade was continued by the satirical ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' magazine; and 3) a grapevine of worried parents and "nincompoop" celebrities fueled the widespread fears.&lt;ref name=FailureJournalism&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=def2fb05-916e-454c-9294-099cfb62e880 |title= Autism 'study' represents a failure of journalism | author= Cameron, Neil |date= 12 January 2011 |work = The Montreal Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Gazette'' also reported that&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no guarantee that debunking the original study is going to sway all parents.

{{further information|Societal and cultural aspects of autism#Notable individuals}}
Media speculation of historical figures on the [[autism spectrum]] is based on reported behavior and anecdotal evidence rather than any clinical observation of the individual.  [[Fred R. Volkmar|Fred Volkmar]] of the [[Yale Child Study Center]] has remarked that "there is unfortunately a sort of cottage industry of finding that everyone has Asperger's".&lt;ref name=GoodeNYT&gt;{{cite news|title=CASES; A Disorder Far Beyond Eccentricity|author=Goode, Erica

Additionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times.  [[New York magazine|''New York'' magazine]] reported some examples, which included that [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] suggested that [[Bill Gates]] is autistic, and that a biographer of [[Warren Buffett]] wrote that his prodigious memory and "fascination with numbers" give him "a vaguely autistic aura." The magazine also reported that on ''[[Celebrity Rehab]]'', Dr. Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player [[Dennis Rodman]] a candidate for an Asperger's diagnosis, and the [[UCLA]] specialist consulted "seemed to concur". [[Nora Ephron]] criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is "an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for."&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=Autism Spectrum: Are You On It?|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/autism-spectrum-2012-11/|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Sowell]] has criticized ''Time''{{'s}} diagnosis of Bill Gates, saying that the people diagnosing him have not seen him personally.&lt;ref name="sowell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sowell|first1=Thomas|title=The Einstein Syndrome : bright children who talk late|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465081417|pages=142, 189|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=046508141X|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Steinberg]] has also criticized the literary portrayals of Warren Buffett and [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] as autistic, writing these men are able to compensate more completely than a truly autistic child or adult whose language deficiencies and cognitive deficits can often put him at a level of functioning in the mentally retarded range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Paul|title=Asperger’s History of Overdiagnosis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/opinion/aspergers-history-of-over-diagnosis.html?scp=1&amp;sq=asperger&amp;st=cse|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dice stacking''' is a [[performance art]], akin to [[juggling]] or [[sleight-of-hand]], in which the performer scoops [[dice]] off a flat surface with a dice cup and then sets the cup down while moving it in a pattern that stacks the dice into a vertical column via centripetal force and inertia. Various dice arrangements, colors of dice, scooping patterns and props allow for many degrees of complexity and difficulty. Dice stacking is usually performed with canceled casino dice, as their square edges and heavy weight give them an advantage when being stacked.

Dice stacking comes from lower Germany.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In Germany the first national dice stacking championship tournament took place in May 2008. Tournament rules included the use of a special designed DiceBoard for players which shows the different prescribed moves. There are two disciplines: the "full-area" discipline and the "speed-area" discipline.

The ''Doom'' video games consist of first-person shooters in which the player controls an unnamed space marine also referred to as ''[[Doomguy]]''. The player has to battle the forces of [[Hell]], consisting of [[demons]] and the [[undead]]. In the games, the player's character will often go back and forth through hell. ''Doom II: Hell on Earth'' follows after the events in ''Doom'', the player once again assumes the role of the unnamed space marine. After returning from Hell, the player finds that [[Earth]] has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.&lt;ref name="classicdoomtext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicdoom.com/doomtext.htm#doom2|accessdate=June 25, 2011|title=DOOMTEXT.HTM: Storylines for Doom, Doom II, Final Doom, Doom 64|author=Transcripts from printed manuals by Ledmeister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and history==
The development of the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' started in 1992, when [[John Carmack]] developed a new game engine, the [[Doom engine]], while the rest of the id Software team finished the ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' prequel, ''[[Spear of Destiny (video game)|Spear of Destiny]]''.

''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in 1994, followed by two other official releases based on its version of the Doom engine: ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'' in 1995, and ''[[Final Doom]]'' in 1996.

''[[Doom 64]]'' was released in 1997, developed by [[Midway Games]] and supervised by id Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN staff | date=November 11, 1996 | title=''Doom 64'' News | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/12/doom-64-news | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Doom 3]]'' was announced in 2000. A reboot to the original ''Doom'', it uses new graphics technology. ''Doom 3'' was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004. ''Doom 3'' had its own expansion pack released in 2005, titled ''[[Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil]]''.

After the ''Doom 4'' project development was scrapped in 2013, id Software's [[Tim Willits]] said that the next game in the ''Doom'' series was still the team's focus, but it has not been confirmed to be titled ''Doom 4''.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/08/05/id-software-and-bethesdas-cancelled-doom-4-just-wasnt-doom-enough |title=id Software and Bethesda's Cancelled 'Doom 4' Just Wasn't 'Doom' Enough |publisher=Multiplayerblog.mtv.com |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=November 29, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104102655/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/08/05/id-software-and-bethesdas-cancelled-doom-4-just-wasnt-doom-enough |archivedate=November 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed to simply ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'' in 2014. The game became a second reboot of the series, rather than a continuation or origin story of earlier games and was released in 2016.&lt;ref name="Doom 4 Polygon"&gt;{{cite web| title=The new Doom game is just titled 'Doom,' runs on id Tech 6, and more details| url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/17/5913883/doom-4-quakecon-reveal| author= Griffin McElroy| date=July 17, 2014| publisher=Polygon| accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel to the 2016 reboot, ''[[Doom Eternal]]'' was announced in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17447568/bethesda-e3-2018-doom-eternal-announcement |title=Doom Eternal announced with fiery trailer |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=June 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
A [[Doom novels|set of four novels]] based on ''Doom'' were written with permission of [[id Software]] by [[Dafydd ab Hugh]] and [[Brad Linaweaver]]. The books, listed in order, are titled ''Knee Deep in the Dead'', ''Hell on Earth'', ''Infernal Sky'' and ''Endgame''. All were published between June 1995 and January 1996 by [[Pocket Books]]. The unnamed Marine is called "Flynn Taggart" or "Fly" in the novels. The first two books feature recognizable locations and situations from the first two games.

A comic book was issued in May 1996, produced by [[Tom Grindberg]] of [[Marvel Comics]] as a giveaway for a video game convention.

On January 31, 2005, a [[board game]] resembling the classic [[Space Hulk]] was released, entitled ''[[Doom: The Boardgame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/doomproducts.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828122930/http://fantasyflightgames.com/va08.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 |title=Doom |publisher=Fantasy Flight Games |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doom (film)|film adaptation]] was released in 2005.

In early 2008, a new series of ''Doom'' novels by [[Matthew J. Costello]], an author who had worked on the story and scripts for ''Doom 3'' and ''Resurrection of Evil'', were published. The series of books aim to novelize the story of ''Doom 3'', with the first installment, ''[[Doom 3: Worlds on Fire|Worlds on Fire]]'', published on February 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=23&amp;pid=586443 |title=Doom 3: Worlds on Fire |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |accessdate=July 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206170046/http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=23&amp;pid=586443 |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second book in the series, ''[[Doom 3: Maelstrom|Maelstrom]]'', was released in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=635379&amp;er=9781416553854 |title=Doom 3: Maestrom |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206170041/http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=635379&amp;er=9781416553854 |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Id Software CEO [[Todd Hollenshead]] stated in an interview that another ''Doom'' movie, possibly based on the cancelled ''Doom 4'', might be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2008/08/id_would_like_another_doom_movie-2/ |title=id Would Like Another Doom Movie |last=Crecente |first=Brian |work=Kotaku |publisher=Allure Media |date=August 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategy guides released in printed editions include:
* Robert E. Waring: ''Doom: Totally Unauthorized Tips &amp; Secrets'', Brady Publishing, {{ISBN|1-56686-187-X}}
* Jonathan Mao Mendoza: ''The Official Doom Survival Guide'', {{ISBN|0-7821-1546-2}}
* Rick Barba: ''Doom Battlebook: Secrets of the Games series'', Prima Publishing, {{ISBN|1-55958-651-6}}

For the 20th anniversary of the series, the [[Game-Art-HQ]] community created an art tribute with 20 illustrations of the characters from the game.

Actress and singer [[Nina Bergman]] teased April 17, 2018 on Twitter that Universal are making a ''Doom'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stefanie|last=Fogel |title=Universal Is Making a New ‘Doom’ Movie |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/new-doom-movie-1202776280/|website=Variety |accessdate=April 21, 2018|date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' ranked the series as the 19th top game of all time, for how "despite the hundreds of copycat titles, no one has ever been able to equal id's original, pulsing classic."&lt;ref&gt;''Next Generation'' 21 (September 1996), p.64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dotto''''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[television]] game show that was a combination of a general knowledge quiz and the children's game [[connect the dots]]. [[Jack Narz]] served as the program's host, with [[Colgate-Palmolive]] as its presenting sponsor. ''Dotto'' rose to become the highest rated daytime program in television history, as of 1958.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Dotto'' replaced ''[[Strike It Rich (radio-TV)|Strike it Rich]]'' in CBS's 11:30 am daytime time slot on January 6, 1958. In a rare instance of two networks programming the same show, a weekly nighttime edition was launched on July 1, 1958 on CBS's competitor [[NBC]] on Tuesday nights in their 9:00{{nbsp}}p.m. slot. At the height of both shows' popularity, ''Dotto'' was abruptly cancelled without public explanation over the weekend of August 16, 1958. Soon after, Dotto was publicly revealed to have been fixed by its producer, tarnishing the show's reputation and setting the stage for legal and political investigation of the [[1950s quiz show scandals|fixing of 1950s quiz shows]].

==Gameplay==
Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed in each game.

The object of the game was to identify the subject of an incomplete portrait drawing, which was accomplished by answering questions and connecting dots. The champion and the challenger were both given their own version of the portrait, which contained fifty dots for each contestant to connect. The contestants were positioned on stage in a manner where neither one could see the other or their progress. There was also an overhead projector on stage that was called the "Dottograph", which would come into play as the game progressed.
                     
Play in each game started with the challenger and he/she was given a category along with a choice of three questions, each with a corresponding number of dots to connect. The questions were worth five, eight, or ten dots and more dots meant a higher difficulty. Answering correctly enabled the challenger to have his/her dots connected, but a wrong answer or failure to answer gave that privilege to the champion. 

To further assist the contestants in identifying the subjects of the portrait, three clues were provided. These were unlocked once a contestant reached a certain number of connections. The first required a total of twenty-five connections, the second thirty-five, and the last forty-five.

At any point in the game, including during the opposing player's turn, a contestant could signal that he/she knew the answer by pressing a button. Narz would then direct that contestant to walk to the Dottograph, which the opposing player could not see, and write that answer on the projecto  screen.

After the answer was recorded, Narz would reveal if the contestant had answered correctly. If he/she did, the opponent was given one last chance to force a tie and play on by correctly identifying the subject based on his/her own progress during the game; if he/she could not do so the first contestant won the game. If the first contestant was incorrect, the opponent automatically won the game. 

The winning player won money for each unconnected dot left on his/her picture, and the amount increased for each tie up to two. On the daytime series, the payout was $10 per dot and it doubled for each tie up to a maximum of $40. On the nighttime series, the payout was $100 per dot and increased by that amount for each tie, resulting in a maximum of $300 per dot.

After a game was completed, usually during the middle of each episode, a "Home Viewer Dotto" game was played, in which a person selected by postcard drawing was called by [[telephone]] live on the air for a chance to guess the person being drawn. If correct, the home viewer won a new car or other valuable prizes, and if incorrect, the viewer received a consolation prize (the daytime version gave away a supply of products advertised by the show's sponsor, [[Colgate-Palmolive]], while the nighttime version gave away a [[Tourism|trip]]). At the end of each episode, additional dots were connected and a clue was displayed for the next episode's "Home Viewer Dotto" game.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/investigationoft01unit|title=Investigation of television quiz shows.

==Broadcast history==
''Dotto'' debuted on January 6, 1958 at 11:30{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing the long-running (and controversial) [[Warren Hull]] game ''[[Strike It Rich (radio-TV)|Strike It Rich]]''. Facing [[Bob Barker]]'s ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'' on [[NBC]] and local programming on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (who [[1957–1958 United States network television schedule (weekday)|had not programmed at 11:30]] in three years), within six months ''Dotto'' became the highest-rated quiz program of the year, and Narz achieved a popularity equal to that of [[Hal March]] on ''[[The $64,000 Question]]''.

The show became so popular that on July 1 a weekly nighttime version began on [[NBC]] with the same format. On NBC's July 29 episode, a contestant on the show, actress and model [[Connie Hines]] had a telegram read on air with Columbia Pictures stating interest in her as an actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Fun &amp; Games Channel|title=Dotto (July 29, 1958): Connie vs John|date=2015-01-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP-85A7IyNs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=114|accessdate=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines later became famous as Carol Post on the popular comedy ''[[Mister Ed]]''.

===Scandal and cancellation===
''Dotto'''s downfall began with a backstage discovery in May 1958. A notebook belonging to contestant (and later journalist) [[Marie Winn]] was found by stand-by contestant, Edward Hilgemeier Jr., who realized that the notebook included questions and answers to be used during Winn's appearances, one of which was against a woman named Yaffe Kimball. He tore out the relevant pages of the notebook for himself. Hilgemeier then told Kimball after her onstage loss that her competitor had been given answers in advance. Hilgemeier later reported that ''Dotto's'' producers paid him $1,500 to keep quiet about his discovery, and Kimball, as the loser of a fixed match, $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/154370718|title=28 Aug 1958, Page 6 - The News Journal at Newspapers.com|newspaper=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dotto'' on CBS, meanwhile, grew in popularity as 1958 went on and became the highest rated Daytime show on the air.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2" /&gt;

Hilgemeier Jr. eventually decided to break his silence. He contacted the [[Colgate-Palmolive]] company on approximately August 8, 1958 with his story, which was then relayed to CBS. Executives at [[CBS]] and the show's sponsor quickly moved to confirm the allegation internally and worked the issue between August 11 and 16.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2" /&gt; CBS executive vice president Thomas Fisher tested [[kinescope]]s of the show against Winn's notebook and concluded that the show looked fixed. Executives at CBS series met with its creator, Frank Cooper, concerning the potential rigging of the show on the evening of Friday, August 15.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/features/august-15-1958-the-day-the-house-began-to-fall-dotto-and-the-great-quiz-show-scandal/|title=August 15, 1958 - The Day the House Began to Fall - Dotto and the Great Quiz Show Scandal {{!}} Memorable TV|date=2015-10-16|newspaper=Memorable TV|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper admitted that the show was indeed fixed, and CBS then reported these findings to NBC as the hosts of the nighttime version. Over the weekend of August 16, both the CBS daytime and NBC primetime series were cancelled.&lt;ref name="dottopartial2"/&gt; In the meantime, in an August 18 affidavit, Hilgemeier complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (as he did to Colgate-Palmolive) that ''Dotto'' was fixed. In interviews, host Jack Narz stated that he was not notified of ''Dotto's'' cancellation until some point after the final episodes had been recorded. Narz was later subpoenaed and took a polygraph test, the results indicating that he was not connected to the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/arts/television/17narz.html "Jack Narz, 85, Genial Host of Television Game Shows, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 16, 2008. Accessed October 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS immediately moved its game show ''Top Dollar'', hosted by [[Warren Hull]], to ''Dotto''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 11:30{{nbsp}}a.m. time slot on Monday, August 18. A live studio audience expecting to be seated for Monday's episode of ''Dotto'' was instead set up as an audience for ''Top Dollar''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Viewers were greeted by the opening, “Dotto, the program which normally airs at this time, will no longer be seen. Instead...welcome to ''Top Dollar''!”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The final NBC nighttime weekly episode aired on August 12, 1958; the next week its Tuesday time slot was replaced with "a filmed drama series".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/1482073|title=Alton Evening Telegraph from Alton, Illinois &amp;middot; Page 16|website=Newspapers.com|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dotto's cancellation on both CBS and NBC was quickly established as fact on August 18, but the reason for why it was cancelled took days to be confirmed by the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

===Aftermath===
{{See also|1950s quiz show scandals}}
Although it was not the first show to be involved in some wrongdoing, ''Dotto'' was the first game show to have such wrongdoing verified. A year earlier, ''[[Twenty-One (game show)|Twenty-One]]'' contestant [[Herb Stempel]] told the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' that his run as champion on the series had been choreographed and that he had been ordered to purposely lose his championship to [[Charles Van Doren]]. Stempel's statements gained more credibility once the match fixing at ''Dotto'' was publicized, and investigations (in the form of a grand jury, and later, congressional hearings) followed.

Jack Narz eventually replaced Warren Hull as host of ''Top Dollar'' by November 1958. That series ran in daytime until October 23, 1959. [[Jack Narz|Narz]] continued to work as a game show host for most of the next twenty years after ''Top Dollar'' ended.

Frank Cooper would never do another game show after ''Dotto,'' which was his longest-running game and his only one for CBS. His previous gaming efforts did not fare as well &amp;ndash; his first game, an NBC show called ''Guess What Happened?'' (dropping the "Guess" after the first show), bombed after three episodes in 1952. ''Droodles,'' starring [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]], ran for three months in 1954 while ABC's ''[[Keep It in the Family (U.S. game show)|Keep It in the Family]]'' ran for four months from 1957-1958.

Connie Hines was revealed to have been coached for her ''Dotto'' appearance, but unlike Marie Winn, she was not given questions and answers in advance. She enjoyed a five-year run as Carol Post on ''[[Mister Ed]]'' and, after a few subsequent television guest roles, retired from acting entirely.

Marie Winn eventually became a journalist whose books include ''[[The Plug-In Drug]]'', a scathing critique on television's influence over children. The book became somewhat controversial for its author having been circumspect about her role in one of the medium's greatest scandals.

===Revival===

It was only in 2013 that [[RTBF]] revived the game in digitized form.

In 2014, it was announced that a revival of ''Dotto'' for French Television is in the works (entitled ''Fizzio'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c21media.net/global-hubert-rework-dotto/ Global, Hubert rework Dotto]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign versions==
''Dotto'' was also hugely successful in the [[United Kingdom]], where it ran on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from September 13, 1958 to June 23, 1960. This version was first hosted by Robert Gladwell, followed by [[Jimmy Hanley]] and then [[Shaw Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Dotto UK Game Shows: ''Dotto'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode status==
Although the series was presumably intact in 1958 (see above), the series is believed to have been [[wiping|destroyed]] sometime afterward as per network practices (and possibly by Colgate's insistence).

Two episodes are known to exist &amp;ndash; a daytime episode from May 20 featuring Marie Winn's victory over Yaffe Kimball-Slatin (which was subject to the rigging controversy, see above), and the third-to-last nighttime episode from July 29 featuring Connie Hines.

An '''election surprise''' (also a '''pre-election surprise''', or, in the U.S., [[October surprise]], where elections are held on [[Election Day (United States)|the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November]]) is an event which occurs preceding an [[election]] which has enough shock value that it may be able to sway voters in close elections. When planned, an election surprise may be an act of [[propaganda]]. Election surprises typically fall into categories such as [[terrorism]], [[political scandal]]s, etc.

There may be disagreement as to what constitutes an election surprise for several reasons:
*There may be general disagreement as to whether the event in question affected, or was intended to affect the outcome of the election, especially as the event and the election may occur in different countries.
*There may be a lack of consensus as to which party the election surprise may have helped, or was intended to help.
*The relative weight of a declaration, and the ability to catch on, help to distinguish true election surprises from minor events.
*What was a surprise for some of the population may have been obvious for another part (such as the total deaths accumulated in a military activity).
*The role a [[speech act]], such as an expression of opinion/research could play. The documentary [[Hacking Democracy]] may not constitute an election surprise, whereas a statement issued by [[Osama bin Laden]] might.

Rumours of potential election surprises may also abound preceding an election.

''The term "election surprise" may also be used to denote an election with a surprising outcome.''

{{main|October surprise}}

*October 1980, [[Iran Hostage Crisis|Iranian Embassy Hostages]].  In October, 1980, preceding [[United States presidential election, 1980|elections]] in [[United States]] on November 4, 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s election campaign manager [[William Casey]], [[Laurence Silberman]] and [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] went to [[Paris]], [[France]] and held a series of meetings with Iranian officials from October 15 to October 20, 1980 to discuss the fate of the 52 remaining hostages taken from the US [[embassy]] building in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] on November 4, 1979.  Iranian officials agreed not to release the hostages prior to [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] on November 4, 1980 in exchange for a shipment of [[F-4 Phantom II]] aircraft tires and spare parts supplied to [[Iran]] from [[Israel]] between October 21 and October 23, 1980 in contravention of the [[United States]]' [[boycott]] and the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]].  The 52 hostages were finally released after 444 days in captivity on the same day, at the same hour, that [[Ronald Reagan]] was sworn into office on January 20, 1981.  The [[United States Congress]] eventually held hearings in 1991 led by [[Lee H. Hamilton]] on the matter, which were underreported in the media and widely considered to be a [[whitewash]], and in which "no credible evidence" was found "linking Reagan's team to the delay of the hostages' release".&lt;ref&gt;Gary Sick. 1991. October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 1976 drunk driving citation on candidate [[George W. Bush]] was considered an election surprise for its suspicious timing, coming out one week before the 2000 US Presidential Election.
*[[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings]] on 11 March 2004, preceding [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|elections]] in [[Spain]] on 14 March 2004. This led to the defeat of the sitting government subsequently leading to the Spanish withdraw from Iraq.
* The [[Killian documents]], A faked set of papers provided to CBS News prior to the 2004 US Presidential Election were also considered an election surprise for the timing and negative propaganda value.
*Rep. [[Mark Foley]] (R-FL) admitted to sending explicit instant messages to underage pages on 29 September 2006, preceding [[United States general elections, 2006|mid-term elections]] in the [[United States]] on 7 November 2006. Democrats said that high-ranking members of the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] may have known about the events.
*[[Saddam Hussein]] was [[Trial of Saddam Hussein|found guilty]] of crimes against humanity on 5 November 2006, preceding [[United States general elections, 2006|mid-term elections]] in the [[United States]] on 7 November 2006.

'''''Epigoni''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐπίγονοι}}, ''Epigonoi'', "Progeny") was an early Greek epic, a sequel to the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'' and therefore grouped in the [[Theban cycle]]. Some ancient authors seem to have considered it a part of the ''Thebaid'' and not a separate poem.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 9.9.5; Scholia on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] 1.308.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source, the epic extended to 7,000 lines of verse.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It told the story of the last battle for [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] by the [[Epigoni]], the children of the heroes who had previously fought for the city. Only the first line is now known:

:Now, Muses, let us begin to sing of younger men&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Fragment 1 West; Scholia on Aristophanes, ''Peace'' 1270; ''Contest of Homer and Hesiod'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional references, without verbal quotations, suggest that the myth of the death of [[Procris]]&lt;ref&gt;Fragment 3* West; ''[[Suda]]'' and other lexica s.v. ''Teumesia''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the story of [[Teiresias]]'s daughter [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]]&lt;ref&gt;Fragment 4 West; Scholia on Apollonius of Rhodes 1.308.&lt;/ref&gt; formed part of the ''Epigoni''.

The epic was sometimes ascribed to [[Homer]], but [[Herodotus]] doubted this attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Scholia]] on [[Aristophanes]] there was an alternative attribution to "Antimachus."&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on Aristophanes, ''Peace'' 1270.&lt;/ref&gt; This presumably means [[Antimachus of Teos]] (8th century BC), and for this reason another verse line attributed without title to Antimachus of Teos is conjecturally thought to belong to the ''Epigoni''.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment 2 West; [[Clement of Alexandria]], ''[[Stromata]]'' 6.12.7.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation for the naming of Antimachus here would be that the later epic poet [[Antimachus of Colophon]] (4th century BC) had been accused of stealing the traditional ''Epigoni'' by incorporating its plot in his literary epic ''Thebais''.

The story of the Epigoni was afterwards told again in the form of a tragedy by [[Sophocles]], ''[[Epigoni (play)|Epigoni]]''.

A '''family entertainment center''' (or '''centre'''), often abbreviated '''FEC''' in the entertainment industry&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stonecreekllc.com/family-entertainment-centers.html |title=About Family Entertainment Centers |author=-&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by line.--&gt; |publisher=StoneCreek Partners Advisory Services, Commercial Real Estate and Leisure-time Industries |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as an '''indoor amusement park''' or '''indoor theme park'''), is a small [[amusement park]] marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a [[theme park]]. They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas."&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs are sometimes called '''family amusement centers''', '''play zones''', '''family fun centers''', or simply '''fun centers'''. Some non-traditional FECs, called '''urban entertainment centers''' ('''UEC'''s), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=  |title=Urban Entertainment Centers |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=StoneCreekLLC.com |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, sometimes operated by [[Non-Profit]] organizations as [[Children's Museums]] or [[science museum|Science Centers]], tend to be geared toward [[edutainment]] experiences rather than simply amusement.  FECs may also be adjuncts to full-scale amusement parks.

==History==
FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of [[theme restaurant]]s that increasingly developed their in-house amusement features, small-scale amusement parks needing more offerings than just a few rides and [[midway (fair)|midway]] games, and diversifying formerly one-attraction venues ([[water park]]s, [[skate park]]s, [[billiard hall]]s, [[bowling alley]]s, and so on).  All three categories have moved over several decades continually toward stock, popular entertainment solutions supplied by third-party vendors.  Among the earliest of the themed restaurants to become known more for family entertainment than food was [[Chuck E. Cheese's]], a pizza restaurant founded in 1977 in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Image:Baby in ball pit.jpg|thumb|right|Ball pits are a popular attraction at family fun centers.]]Most FECs have at least five common major or "anchor" attractions, to provide diverse patrons (often in large parties) at least one to two hours of entertainment, to encourage repeat visits, and to reduce time spent waiting for any given attraction.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  Some of the more usual attractions include (depending upon size, climate, etc.):
{{div col |colwidth=30em}}
*[[Amusement ride|Amusement/thrill rides]] (elevated, but generally small-scale)
*[[Arcade games]]
*[[Ball pit]]
*[[Batting cage]]s
*[[Bowling alley]]
*[[Bumper boats]]
*[[Restaurant]]
*Food: [[Snack bar]] and [[fast food]] (especially [[pizza]])
*Food: Quality family and group dining in [[theme restaurant]]
*[[Inflatable castle|Inflatables]]
*[[Kiddie ride]]s (ground-level)
*[[Kart racing]]
*[[Laser tag]]
*[[Miniature golf]]
*[[Movie theater]]
*[[Music]] and [[dancing]]
*[[Playground]] equipment and climbing structures
*[[Redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games
*[[Roller skating]]
*[[retail|Specialty shops]] (toys, comics, music, etc.)
*[[Virtual reality]]
*[[Water slide]]
{{div col end}}
[[Image:Playport Indoor Playarea.png|thumb|right|Multi-tiered climbing structures such as this one are common at family entertainment centers.]]
The most common anchor activities are miniature golf, kart racing, arcade and redemption games, and food &amp; beverage, according to industry specialists StoneCreek Partners.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  FECs rarely use custom-built attractions, because of the costs involved, and instead install off-the-shelf systems provided and maintained by industry equipment vendors.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Any given FEC may lean more towards outdoor activities, arcade gaming, or passive entertainment and dining. Each may cater to different age ranges, all the time, or during certain hours, e.g. children and entire families in the daytime, and teens to young adults in the evening, with specific promotional programs to attract different market segments at different times.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Business model==
FECs tend to serve "sub-regional markets",&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; such as small cities, quadrants or boroughs of larger cities, and a large suburban area outside such a city.  Their busiest times are weekend afternoons and Thursday through Saturday evenings.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Because most of the attractions are essentially the same from FEC to FEC,&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; two of the most important factors in a particular center distinguishing itself to potential customers are a highly visible location&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt; (hard to obtain because other uses for the land are often more competitive&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;), and a consistently developed and promoted theme that appeals to the target market segments, "the fun factor in the overall decor".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

Parental concerns are also important. While children themselves rarely think of it, a major factor in the attractiveness of an FEC to parents is on-site safety and security, as adults may drop off older children at such an establishment to entertain themselves.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;  An increasingly important factor for success is high-quality food and drink to attract parental spending as well as whole-family dining.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;

==Non-traditional FECs==
Various major media and entertainment brands, including [[Disney]], [[Lego]], [[NASCAR]], [[Sega]], [[Sony]], [[Regal Entertainment Group|United Artists/Regal]] and [[Viacom]], have been attached to family entertainment centers, often much less "traditional" than local and chain FECs, with custom-built, unique attractions, usually heavily branded, and most often located in major metropolitan areas.  The first such '''urban entertainment center''' (UEC) was the [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], which opened in 1993, linking several Universal properties.&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Including various retail outlets, restaurants, and attractions, the CityWalk created a great deal of "sustained buzz" in the retail real estate industry, which began "embracing the notion that Universal Studios, Sony, Disney, and other entertainment companies could create new anchors and entertainment programs for shopping centers".&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 2" /&gt; Another significant UEC was the [[Sony Metreon]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (1999&amp;ndash;2006).

Some nonprofit, educational installations, such as the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, also have aspects of FECs in format and atmosphere, but with activities geared toward learning and experiencing rather than simple entertainment. Some for-profit enterprises also use this model, or mix [[edutainment]] with simpler amusement attractions.

==Industry organizations==
The major international industry association that supports FECs is the [http://www.iaapa.org International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions] (IAAPA), which merged with and absorbed the membership of the International Association for the Leisure and Entertainment Industry (IALEI) in October 2009.&lt;ref name="IAPPA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/pressroom/pressreleases/IALEIDissolutionIAAPAMergerPlansFinalRelease.asp |title=News Release: IALEI Dissolution IAAPA Merger Plans Final |first=David |last=Mandt |work=IAAPA.org |publisher=International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions |location=Alexandria, Virginia |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IAAPA maintains addresses in the [[Virginia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Brussels, Belgium]] and [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="IAAPA 2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iaapa.org/aboutus/ContactUs.asp |title=Contact Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=IAPPA.org |publisher=''op. cit'' |year=2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Laser Tag Association (ILTA) also remains active (and more broadly than its name suggests).  ILTA is based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], U.S.&lt;ref name="ILTA 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |title=About Us |author= |work=LaserTag.org |year=2011 |publisher=International Laser Tag Association |location=Indianapolis, Indiana |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603212344/http://lasertag.org/about-us.html |archivedate=June 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many smaller, community centric FEC's and owner/operators who can't always make the IAAPA tradeshow, IAAO the International Association of Amusement Operators [https://web.archive.org/web/20111219122923/http://www.amusementoperators.org/] is an online resource for family entertainment center operators and startups.

==In Canada==
Canadian FECs are called "family entertainment centres" or "fun centres", due to [[British English|British]]-style spelling conventions in [[Canadian English]].
*[[Chuck E. Cheese's]] (U.S.-owned)
*[[Playdium]]

==In Mexico==
*[[KidZania]] (Mexico City, 1999)
*[[America's Incredible Pizza Company]] (Monterrey, U.S.-owned)

==In the United States==
The main national industry group in the U.S. is the [[National_Association_of_Family_Entertainment_Centers|National Association of Family Entertainment Centers (NAFEC)]], which is perhaps incongruously a division of the International Laser Tag Association (ILTA).

Some U.S.-based companies also have venues in Canada (noted above), but this is rare due to the legal/political difficulties involved in cross-border corporations.

American FECs vary wildly in themes, size and features. Some of the larger businesses in this category have included:&lt;ref name="StoneCreek 1" /&gt;&lt;!--Sources some but not all of this list, especially many of the dates and places. IT MUST BE CITED WHERE IT *DOES* SOURCE THE MATERIAL, not just at the top of the list! --&gt;

&lt;!-- **************************************************************

'''''Flight of the Red Balloon''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le voyage du ballon rouge'''}}) is a 2007 French-Taiwanese film directed by [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]].  It is the first part in a new series of films produced by [[Musée d'Orsay]], and tells the story of a French family as seen through the eyes of a Chinese student. The film was shot in August and September 2006 on location in Paris. This is [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]'s first non-Asian film. It references the classic 1956 French short ''[[The Red Balloon]]'' directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]].

The film opened the ''Un Certain Regard'' section of the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2007.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4436044/year/2007.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Le voyage du ballon rouge|accessdate=2011-08-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Suzanne, a [[puppeteer]], lives with her young son Simon in an apartment in [[Paris]]. While Suzanne is busy with producing her new Chinese puppet play based on an ancient Chinese text (求妻煮海人), she hires a Chinese film student Song as Simon's new nanny.  For her college project - a homage to [[Albert Lamorisse]]'s famous 1956 film ''[[The Red Balloon]]'' - Song starts to film Simon. She develops a good relationship with mother and son, and translates for Suzanne's masterclass with a Chinese puppet master. 

While Simon's older sister Louise is about to graduate from a high school in Brussels, Suzanne plans for Louise to apply for colleges in Paris. For that, she tries to evict her downstairs tenant Marc, who has repeatedly failed to pay his rent, while arguing on the phone with Pierre, Simon's father, who has absented himself to Canada for two years to write a novel and who is rarely in touch. Simon visits the Musée d'Orsay on a school trip, where his class is shown ''The Ball'', a painting by [[Félix Vallotton]] in which a child chases a red ball.

== Cast ==
* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Suzanne
* [[Simon Iteanu]] as Simon
* [[Hippolyte Girardot]] as Marc
* Fang Song as Song
* [[Louise Margolin]] as Louise
* [[Anna Sigalevitch]] as Anna
* [[Charles-Edouard Renault]] as Lorenzo
* Li Chuan-Zan (李傳燦, son of [[Li Tian-lu|Li Tian-Lu]]) as the puppet master

==Critical reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 80% of 87 sampled critics and 90% of top critics gave the film positive reviews. The average rating is 6.9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon) (2007) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flight_of_the_red_balloon/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher = [[Flixster]] |accessdate = January 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Hoberman, writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' was particularly appreciative of the film stating, "Flight of the Red Balloon is contemplative but never static, and punctuated by passages of [[Cinéma pur|pure cinema]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-04-01/film/floating-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Stables of [[Sight &amp; Sound]] also highly praised the film, "Finding a serene and contemplative beauty in the quotidian world has long been Taiwanese master-minimalist Hou Hsiao Hsien's stock in trade.... Hou brings the same depth and deliberation to the film's Parisian exterior....  ultimately, it is cinema that is the film's sacred repository of memory and creativity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/4261|title=BFI {{!}} Sight &amp; Sound {{!}} Flight of the Red Balloon (2006)|last=Institute|first=The British Film|website=old.bfi.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader likes the film as &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;A relatively slight but sturdy work by Taiwanese master Hou Hsiao-hsien, this slice of contemporary urban life more or less does for Paris what his Cafe Lumiere did for Tokyo, albeit with less minimalism and more overt emotion''.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

On the other hand, Duane Byrge of Hollywood Reporter was not impressed. "The imagery of the classic movie, where a spirited red balloon wafts unpredictably over Paris, never even attempts to reach a metaphorical height, nor does it even engage us compositionally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flight_of_the_red_balloon/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon) - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first film, ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', was directed by [[Ishirō Honda]] and released by Toho in 1954 and became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by [[Akira Ifukube]], which was reused in many of the later films. The original also introduced the work of special effects master [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], who used miniatures and "suitmation" to convey the large scale of the monster and its destruction. For its North American release, the film was reworked as an adaptation and released in 1956 as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]''. The adaptation featured new footage with [[Raymond Burr]] edited together with the original Japanese footage.

Toho was inspired to make the original ''Godzilla'' after the commercial success of the 1952 re-release of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and success of ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953). The success of the ''Godzilla'' series itself would go on to inspire other monster films worldwide. The popularity of the films has led to Godzilla being featured in other media, such as [[Godzilla in popular culture|television, music, literature]], and [[Godzilla video games|video games]]. Godzilla has been one of the most recognizable symbols in Japanese pop culture worldwide, remains a well-known facet of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese films]] and was one of the first examples of the popular ''[[kaiju]]'' and ''[[tokusatsu]]'' subgenres in Japanese entertainment.

The tone and themes vary per film. Several of the films have political themes, others have dark tones, [[shared universe|complex internal mythology]], or are simple action movies featuring aliens or other monsters, while others have simpler themes accessible to children.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|pp=1–5}} Godzilla's role varies from purely a destructive force to an ally of humans, or a protector of Japanese values, or a hero to children. The name '''Godzilla''' is a romanization of the original Japanese name '''Gojira'''—which is a combination of two Japanese words: ''gorira'' (ゴリラ), "gorilla", and ''kujira'' (クジラ), "whale". The word alludes to the size, power and aquatic origin of Godzilla. As developed by Toho, the monster is an offshoot of the combination of radioactivity and ancient dinosaur-like creatures, indestructible and possessing special powers (see [[Godzilla#Characteristics|Godzilla characteristics]]).

== History ==
The ''Godzilla'' film series is broken into several (different) eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga ([[monster movies]]) in Japan. The first two eras refer to the [[Japanese emperor]] during production: the [[Shōwa era]] and the [[Heisei era]]. The third is called the Millennium era as the emperor ([[Heisei]]) is the same but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.

Over the series history, the films have reflected [[History of Japan|the social and political climate in Japan]].{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=240}} In the original film, Godzilla was an [[allegory]] for the effects of the [[nuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and the consequences that such weapons might have on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/vqr-portfolio/godzilla%E2%80%99s-footprint|title=Godzilla's Footprint|last=Ryfle|first=Steve|work=VQR Online|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2127-godzilla-poetry-after-the-a-bomb|title=Godzilla: Poetry After the A-Bomb|last=Hoberman|first=J.|work=Criterion|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' 1954 [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' 1984 [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The radioactive contamination of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' through the United States' [[Castle Bravo]] [[thermonuclear]] device test on [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, led to much press coverage in Japan preceding the release of the first movie in 1954. The Heisei and Millennium series have largely continued this concept.

=== Shōwa period (1954–1975) ===
[[File:Godzilla 1954-2014 incarnations.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Every film incarnation of Godzilla between 1954–2017|alt=montage of pictures of dinosaur-like creatures]]
The initial series of movies is named for the Shōwa period in Japan (as all of these films were produced before the "''Shōwa Emperor''" [[Hirohito]]'s death in 1989).{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=29}} This Shōwa timeline spanned from 1954, with ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', to 1975, with ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. With the exceptions of ''Godzilla'', ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'', ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' and ''Terror of Mechagodzilla'', much of the Shōwa series monster-action was intentionally made comical and laughable for children, with Godzilla frequently engaged in clownish slapstick wrestling with other monsters. Starting with ''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'', Godzilla began evolving into a friendlier, more playful [[antihero]] (this transition was complete by ''[[Son of Godzilla]]'', where it is shown as a good character), and as years went by, it evolved into an [[anthropomorphic]] [[superhero]]. ''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'' was also significant for introducing Godzilla's arch-enemy and the main antagonist of the movie series, [[King Ghidorah]]. The films ''Son of Godzilla'' and ''[[All Monsters Attack]]'' were aimed at youthful audiences, featuring the appearance of Godzilla's son, [[Minilla]]. ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' was notable for introducing Godzilla's robotic arch-enemy and secondary villain of the movie series [[Mechagodzilla]]. The Shōwa period tied loosely in to a number of Toho-produced films in which Godzilla himself did not appear and consequently saw the addition of many monsters into the ''Godzilla'' continuity, three of which ([[Mothra]], [[Rodan]] and [[Varan]]) originated in their own solo movies and another five ([[Anguirus]], [[Kumonga]], [[Baragon]], [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] and [[Gorosaurus]]) appeared in their first films as either antagonistic or secondary characters.

[[Haruo Nakajima]] mainly portrayed Godzilla since 1954 until his retirement in 1972. However, other stunt actors portrayed the character in his absence, such as [[Katsumi Tezuka]], Yū Sekida, Ryosaku Takasugi, Seiji Onaka, Shinji Takagi, Isao Zushi, and [[Toru Kawai]].&lt;ref name="Godzilla"&gt;{{cite video|people=Takeo Murata (writer) and Ishirō Honda (writer/director)|title=[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[DreamWorks Classics]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Am. Godzilla"&gt;{{cite video|people=Al C. Ward (writer) and Ishirō Honda, [[Terry Morse]] (writers/directors)|title=[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[DreamWorks Classics]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] directed the special effects for the first six films of the series. His protege Sadamasa Arikawa took over the effects work for the next three films (with Tsuburaya supervising), while [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] directed the special effects for the last six films of the series.

=== Heisei period (1984–1995) ===
Toho rebooted the series in 1984 with ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'', starting the second era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the ''Heisei'' series.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} ''The Return of Godzilla'' serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Showa era. ''The Return of Godzilla'' was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=12}}

The Heisei films are set in a single timeline, with each film providing continuity to the other films, and brings Godzilla back as a destructive force of nature that is feared by humans.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} The biological nature and science behind Godzilla became a much more discussed issue in the films, showing the increased focus on the moral aspects of genetics. ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' gave the first concrete birth story for Godzilla, featuring a "Godzillasaurus" dinosaur-like creature that was mutated by nuclear radiation into Godzilla. Godzilla was portrayed by [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] for the Heisei films while the special effects were directed by [[Koichi Kawakita]], with the exception of ''The Return of Godzilla'', for which the effects were directed by Teruyoshi Nakano.

=== Millennium period (1999–2004) ===
Toho rebooted the franchise for a second time, with the 1999 film ''[[Godzilla 2000: Millennium]]'', starting the third era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the Millennium series. The Millennium series is treated similarly to an [[anthology series]] where each film, with the exception of ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (which are a series all their own), is set in its own timeline and follows-up on the events of the original 1954 film, but ignores the events of the Shōwa and Heisei eras.

After the release of 2004's ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', marking the 50th anniversary of the ''Godzilla'' film franchise, Toho decided to put the series on hiatus for another 10 years. Toho also demolished the water stage on its lot used in numerous ''Godzilla'', kaiju and tokusatsu films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bucketmovies.com/bucket-hall-of-fame-the-toho-big-pool/ |title=Bucket Hall of Fame: The Toho Big Pool |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229081538/http://www.bucketmovies.com/bucket-hall-of-fame-the-toho-big-pool/ |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoshimitsu Banno]], who had directed 1971's ''[[Godzilla vs. Hedorah]]'', secured the rights from Toho to make an [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] short film production, based on a story similar to his ''Hedorah'' film. This project eventually led to the development of [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Legendary's ''Godzilla'']].

[[Tsutomu Kitagawa]] portrayed Godzilla for the majority of the Millennium films, with the exception of ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', in which Godzilla was portrayed by [[Mizuho Yoshida (actor)|Mizuho Yoshida]]. Unlike the Showa and later Heisei films, the special effects for the Millennium films were directed by multiple effects directors such as [[Kenji Suzuki (director)|Kenji Suzuki]] (''Godzilla 2000'', ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]''), Makoto Kamiya (''Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack''), Yuichi Kikuchi (''Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla''), and Eiichi Asada (''Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.'', ''Godzilla: Final Wars'').

In January 2018, Toho announced its plans to invest 15 billion yen ($135 million) for the next three years beginning in 2019 to co-produce content with Hollywood and Chinese studios who have licensed Toho's properties, such as ''[[Godzilla]]'', ''[[Your Name]]'', and ''[[Pokémon]]''. Toho will invest 25% in production costs and will earn a higher share in revenue and manage creators rights so their creative input will be shown in each work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Japan-Update/Godzilla-studio-Toho-to-co-produce-content-with-foreign-filmmakers 'Godzilla' studio Toho to co-produce content with foreign filmmakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Toho’s Chief Godzilla Officer Keiji Ota revealed that a sequel to ''Shin Godzilla'' will not happen but revealed plans for a "World of Godzilla", a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and other Toho monsters after 2021.

{{Quote|"After 2021, we’re thinking of a potential strategy that [releases] Godzilla movies uninterrupted at a rate of every 2 years, although there is a preference for a yearly pace as well. The future of the series and its forwarding developments are very conscious of the method of "shared universe". Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, etc. could all share a single world view much like a Marvel movie where Iron Man and the Hulk can crossover with each other.

The film utilized a majority of the footage from the Japanese original but a majority of the political themes and social commentaries were removed, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese original replaced with new scenes shot exclusively for the film featuring Raymond Burr interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production. In addition, sound-effects and soundtracks were tweaked and some dialogue was dubbed into English. Similar "Americanizations" occurred for the North American releases of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla 1985]],'' the latter which included Burr reprising the role of American journalist Steve Martin.

In 1957, producer Harry Rybnick attempted to produce a Hollywood remake of ''Godzilla Raids Again'' titled ''The Volcano Monsters'', however, funding from AB-PT Pictures collapsed after the company closed down and ''Godzilla Raids Again'' was instead dubbed in English and released in 1959 by [[Warner Bros.]] as ''Gigantis the Fire Monster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/the-first-hollywood-attempt-to-re-imagine-godzilla-ha-1573231492|title=The First Hollywood Attempt to "Reimagine" Godzilla Happened Back in 1957|last=Lizardman|first=|work=Observation Deck|date=May 7, 2014|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''"Cozzilla"''===
In 1976, Italian director [[Luigi Cozzi]] intended to re-release ''Godzilla'' in Italy. Facing resistance from exhibitors to showing a black and white film, Cozzi instead licensed a negative of ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' from Toho and created a new movie in color, adding lots of stock footage of graphic death and destruction and short scenes from newsreel footage from World War II, which he released as ''[[Godzilla (1977 film)|Godzilla]]'' in 1977. The film was colorized using a process called Spectrorama 70, where color gels are put on the original black and white film, becoming one of the first black and white movies to be colorized. Dialogue was dubbed into Italian and new music was added. After the initial Italian run, the negative became Toho's property and prints have only been exhibited in Italy.

In 2007, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] Godzilla appeared in the Toho [[slice of life]] movie ''[[Always Zoku Sanchōme no Yūhi]]'' (''Always: Sunset on Third Street 2''). In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom. The making of the sequence was kept a secret. Godzilla has been referenced and has briefly appeared in several other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Television ===
In Japan, Godzilla appeared in five out of 26 episodes of Toho's live-action ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' television program in 1973. Also in Japan, Godzilla (along with a plethora of other kaiju) appeared in an animated toy show called ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' that ran in 1997–1998.

Between 1994 and 1996, four 30 minute episode [[Original video animation|OVA's]] were created featuring Godzilla and various other kaiju from the Showa series of movies. The characters were depicted in a cute and friendly '[[chibi (term)|chibi]]'-esque anime style. The series of OVA's was titled ''Godzilland'' (ゴジランド ''Gojirando'') and was aimed at primary school age children. This series featured [[Godzilla]] (the main protagonist), Gojirin (a pink female version of Godzilla), [[Minilla]] (Godzilla Junior), [[Mothra]] (and two Mothra larvae), [[King Ghidorah]], [[Gigan]], [[Hedorah]] (who is depicted as female in this adaptation), [[Moguera]], [[Rodan]], [[Baragon]], [[Mechagodzilla]], [[Anguirus]] and [[Ebirah]]. ''Godzilland'' was conceived initially to sell merchandise for the ''Godzill''a franchise. The depictions of Godzilla and the various other kaiju were featured on stickers, toys, cards and board games.

The educational media company [[Gakken]] and the film studio [[Toho]] collaborated together to release two additional direct-to-video shorts of ''Godzilland'' which were both called ''Recommend! Godzilland'' (すすめ！ゴジランド ''Susume! Gojirando'') in 1994. The main purpose of the first of the two video shorts was teaching Japanese children how to write in Hiragana (すすめ!ゴジランド～ひらがな – ''Susume! Gojirando ~ Hi-ra ga na'') and the other was intended to teach Japanese children how to count. ( すすめ!ゴジランド～かず1・2・3 – ''Susume! Gojirando ~ kazu 1 2 3''). Both specials featured all the characters who were in the ''Godzilland'' TV anime series. Two other TV specials were released two years later by the same company, but had different educational topics. These two specials were centered around math. The first of these two specials was called "すすめ！ゴジランド-ゴジラとあそぼう たしざん – ''Susume! Gojirando – Gojira to asobouta shizan'' and the second was titled "すすめ！ゴジランド ゴジラとあそぼう ひきざん – ''Susume! Gojirando Gojira to asobou hiki zan''. These two specials centered around addition and subtraction.
The episodes of ''Recommend! Godzilland'' was directed by Seinosuke Tanaka &amp; Osamu Nakayama.

''Hi-ra ga na'' and ''kazu 1 2 3'' were the only two episodes to use both cel animation and digital ink and paint animation, but ''Gojira to asobouta shizan'' and ''Gojira to asobou hiki zan'' were the only episodes to fully use digital ink and paint animation.

''Godzilland'' also included live action segments, which featured a human girl and an actor in a Godzilla suit. The segments would consist of Godzilla telling the girl about his childhood adventures.

The success of the ''Godzilla'' franchise has spawned two American [[Saturday morning cartoon]] TV series: the first one is the collaboration series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] and co-produced by [[Toho]], ''[[Godzilla (animated series)|Godzilla]]'', and the second one produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', a cartoon sequel to the [[1998 film]]. Both series feature a scientific investigative team who call upon Godzilla as an ally, as well as making several homages to the Shōwa films. Several antagonist monsters in both series have been inspired by extant Toho creations.

In 1991, two ''Godzilla'' films, ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' and ''Godzilla versus the Sea Monster'', were shown on the movie-mocking TV show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

A creature resembling Godzilla in parody, alongside another parody character resembling what appears to be a cross between [[Ultraman]] and [[Kamen Rider]], appears in the television special ''[[Olive the Other Reindeer|Olive, The Other Reindeer]]'' during the song "Merry Christmas After All", during part of which Olive, Santa, and the other reindeer are shown passing through Tokyo delivering gifts. The two characters are shown to be friendly and taking part in the song and dance routine shown to include numerous figures, both real and fictional, in the show in various locations visited by the team as they make Santa's annual trip around the world.

Godzilla made an appearance in a [[Godzilla vs. Charles Barkley|Nike commercial]] in which Godzilla (this version was created at ILM) went one-on-one in an oversized basketball game with a giant version of the NBA star [[Charles Barkley]].

Godzilla has been referenced multiple times in the American animated TV sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Godzilla first appeared in the episode "[[Lisa on Ice]]" when Lisa imagines herself on Monster Island and is chased by various kaiju, including Godzilla. It has also been referenced in "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", "[[Mayored to the Mob]]" (where Godzilla can be seen signing autographs at [[Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con]]), "[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]" (in which the plane carrying the Simpson family is being attacked by Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and Gamera), "[[Simpsons Tall Tales]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]", "[[Homerazzi]]", "[[Wedding for Disaster]]", "[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XXIV]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVI]]".

=== Video games ===
{{Main|List of Godzilla games}}

A game called ''Gojira-kun'' (which was originally going to be titled ''Gojiraland'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tcrf.net/Godzilla-kun|title=Godzilla-kun – The Cutting Room Floor|work=tcrf.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released for the [[MSX]] in 1985. The art style is similar to the style used in the ''Godzilland'' [[Original video animation|OVA]]'s. In 1990, ''Gojira-kun: Kaijū Daikōshin'' was released for the Game Boy. It featured sprites that were similar to the ones used in ''Gojira-kun''. The game included cut scenes that depicted a different style to the rest of the game. In 1993, ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' 's Bagan, a newly created Toho-approved creation, was released for the SNES and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju in a former film/movie. 

In 2007, ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' Krystalak and Obsidius, two newly created Toho-approved creations, was released for the Wii and DS and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju. Legendary's Godzilla was featured as a playable character in Bandai Namco's 2014 video game ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'' as "Hollywood Godzilla".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/ps4/games/godzilla/119160|title=Godzilla for PlayStation 4|work=Gamestop|date=|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely popular video game ''[[Pokémon]]'' has made multiple references to Godzilla. The Dark/Rock type Pokémon [[Tyranitar]] is a direct reference to Godzilla. The Pokémon's appearance is a large green lizard monster-type creature who is characterised as an unstoppable force. In 2015–present, ''Gojira'' and ''Godzilla 2600'' from [[Homebrew (video games)|Homebrew]] fangame were released for the NES and Atari 2600.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Godzilla (comics)}}
A ''Godzilla'' [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|series of books]] was published by [[Random House]] during the late 1990s. The company created different series for different age groups, the [[Godzilla (Scott Ciencin series)|Scott Ciencin series]] being aimed at preteens and the [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|Marc Cerasini series]] being aimed at teens and young adults. Several [[manga]] have been derived from specific ''Godzilla'' films and both [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] have published ''Godzilla'' comic book series (1977–1979 and 1987–1999, respectively). In 2011, IDW Publishing started a new series ''Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters'' rebooting the Godzilla story. It was followed by two sequel series, ''Godzilla'' (published in book form as ''Godzilla: History's Greatest Monster'') and ''Godzilla: Rulers of Earth'', as well as seven five-issue miniseries to date.

To tie-in with the 2014 film, three books were published. [[Titan Books]] published a novelization of the movie in May 2014, written by Greg Cox. The graphic novel ''Godzilla: Awakening'' by Max Borenstein, Greg Borenstein and Eric Battle served as a prequel, and ''Godzilla: The Art of Destruction'' by Mark Cotta told about the making of the movie. Godzilla has been referenced in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' comics on three separate occasions. The character is featured in ''Bart Simpson's Guide to Life'' where it and other kaiju characters such as [[Minilla]] and [[King Ghidorah]] can be seen; it is featured in the comic "''An Anime Among Us!'''' and ''K-Bart''.  Godzilla is also featured in the comic ''Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror 7'' where it and other kaiju can be seen referenced on the front cover. Godzilla has also been referenced in Marc Brown's ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' adventure book called ''Arthur's April Fool'' where Francine told Arthur &amp; Buster that they need to pick on someone their own size like Godzilla. Both [[Godzilla]] &amp; [[Arthur Read|Arthur]] became the two of the most popular characters to root for.

[[Blue Öyster Cult]] released the song "[[Godzilla (song)|Godzilla]]" in 1977. Artists such as [[Fu Manchu]], [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]] and [[Double Experience]] have included cover versions of this song on their albums. American musician [[Michale Graves]] wrote a song titled "Godzilla" for his 2005 album, "Punk Rock Is Dead." The lyrics mention Godzilla and several on-screen adversaries such as Mothra, Hedorah, Destoroyah, and Gigan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Punk Rock Is Dead]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura has a song titled "Biotech is Godzilla" on its 1993 release ''Chaos A.D.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/sepultura/biotech%20is%20godzilla_20123343.html|title=Biotech Is Godzilla Lyrics – Sepultura|work=lyricsfreak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French death metal band [[Gojira (band)|Gojira]] named the band after Godzilla's name in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gojira-mn0000721409/biography |title=Gojira: Biography |website=allmusic |accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song "Simon Says" by Pharoahe Monch is a hip-hop remix of the [[Godzilla March]] theme song. The instrumental version of this song was notably used in the 2000 film ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. The British band [[Lostprophets]] released a song called "[[We Are Godzilla, You Are Japan]]" on its second studio album ''[[Start Something]]''. The American punk band [[Groovie Ghoulies]] released a song called "Hats off to You (Godzilla)" as a tribute to Godzilla. It is featured on the EP ''Freaks on Parade'' released in 2002. The American artist [[Doctor Steel]] released a song called 'Atomic Superstar' about Godzilla on his album ''[[People of Earth (album)|People of Earth]]'' in 2002. In 2003, the British singer [[Siouxsie Sioux]] released the album ''[[Hái!]]'' with her band [[The Creatures]]; the album had a Japanese theme with a song dedicated to the monster, simply titled "[[Godzilla!]]".

The record label Shifty issued compilation ''Destroysall'' with 15 songs from 15 bands, ranging from hardcore punk to doom-laden death metal. Not all songs are dedicated to Godzilla, but all do appear connected to monsters from Toho Studios. Fittingly, the disc was released on August 1, 2003, the 35th anniversary of the Japanese release of ''Destroy All Monsters''.

[[MF Doom|MF DOOM]]) released ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'', a hip-hop album featuring guests from the group [[Monsta Island Czars]], another Godzilla-themed hip-hop group. These albums include multiple Godzilla samples throughout the series. Taiwanese American electronic musician [[Mochipet]] released the EP ''Godzilla Rehab Center'' on August 21, 2012, featuring songs named after monsters in the series including Gigan, King Ghidorah, Moguera and Hedorah.

== Cultural impact ==
{{Main|Godzilla in popular culture}}

Godzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of [[Japanese popular culture]] worldwide and is an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the [[Kaijū|kaiju]] subset of the tokusatsu genre. It has been considered a filmographic [[metaphor]] for the United States (with the "[[-zilla]]" part of the name being used in vernacular language as a suffix to indicate something of exaggerated proportions), as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier ''Godzilla'' films, especially the original ''Godzilla'', portrayed Godzilla as a frightening, nuclear monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the nuclear attacks on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and the possibility of recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/popcult/handouts/metaphor/godzilla/godzilla.html |title=The Monster That Morphed Into a Metaphor |author=Terrence Rafferty |date=May 2, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two [[prehistoric creatures]] from the [[fossil record]] have been named after Godzilla. ''[[Gojirasaurus]] quayi'' is a [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in the [[Triassic Period]]; a partial skeleton was unearthed in [[Quay County, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/carnivorousdinosaurs/p/gojirasaurus.htm|title=Gojirasaurus|last=Strauss|first=Bob|work=About.com:Dinosaurs|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dakosaurus andiniensis]]'', a [[crocodile]] from the [[Jurassic Period]], was nicknamed "Godzilla" before being [[scientific classification|scientifically classified]]. In 2010 the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] named their most recently acquired scout vessel MV ''Gojira''. Toho, the people in charge of the ''Godzilla'' franchise, served them with a notice to remove the name and in response the boat's name was changed in May 2011 to [[MV Brigitte Bardot|MV ''Brigitte Bardot'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-110525-1.html |title=The Beast Transforms into a Beauty as Godzilla Becomes the Brigitte Bardot – Sea Shepherd Conservation Society |publisher=Seashepherd.org |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703225105/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-110525-1.html |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16228">{{About|1930s and 1940s South Carolina programming services|the hospital radio station at Saint John's Hospital in Livingston, Scotland|Radio Grapevine}}
'''Grapevine radio''' refers to the transmission infrastructures, used for distributing audio programs, which were built to serve a small number of rural [[upstate South Carolina]] communities from the early 1930s to the middle 1940s. Despite their name, these systems did not employ radio transmitters, but were actually a type of "[[telephone newspaper]]", because the programs were sent telephonically over wires strung to subscribing homes.

The equipment used to distribute programming over a facility's wire network was located at a central site, for example a general store's back room. Programs normally consisted of retransmissions of radio stations, however, some programming was locally produced, originating from a studio at the distribution site or relayed from a local church or other gathering place. The locally produced programs included announcements and emergency messages, commercials and live performances. The transmissions were made daily, generally starting around 6 a.m. and running until 10:00 p.m. or midnight.

The grapevine systems soon became unneeded, because they primarily served homes that did not have electricity. Once a community received electric service the local grapevine system would soon close down, as the subscribers switched to radio receivers that could receive a wide selection of programs at no cost, instead of the single program and monthly fees characteristic of the grapevine systems.
==Historical background==
Information about the grapevine installations (also called "speakerline") is limited, because of their brief history and the fact that they do not appear to have been established outside a small region of South Carolina. Unlike radio stations, they did not require government approval to operate. Their existence was also dependent on an unusual and short-lived economic and technical environment, as they required a central distribution site that had access to electricity, plus a surrounding community of prospective subscribers that did not have electric service.

Throughout the 1930s large parts of the United States, including most farms, did not have electricity. Although organized radio broadcasting had begun in the early 1920s, in rural upstate South Carolina there were no nearby radio stations strong enough to be picked up by battery-less [[Crystal radio|crystal radio receivers]], and although battery-powered sets existed, without electrical service there was no convenient way to recharge the batteries. The economic struggles caused by the [[Great Depression]] meant that many people could not even afford a newspaper subscription. Thus, there was a lack of entertainment and a strong sense of isolation in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/37277242/THE_DEVELOPMENT_OF_RURAL_WIRED_RADIO_SYSTEMS_IN_UPSTATE_SOUTH_CAROLINA "The Development of Rural Wired Radio Systems in Upstate South Carolina"] by Susan K. Opt, ''Journal of Radio Studies 1'' (1992), pages 73-74. (academia.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; As one person remembered, connecting to the grapevine service meant that "we had 'arrived' and were at last in touch with the outside world".&lt;ref&gt;''Listening to Radio, 1920-1950'' by Ray Barfield, 1996, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rural electrification#United States|rural electrification]] projects of the 1930s and 1940s eventually eliminated potential customers, making the grapevine systems no longer needed as their former customers switched to listening to radio stations.
==Initial installation at Mauldin==
[[File:Map of Mauldin, South Carolina grapevine radio system (1936).gif|thumb|right|425px|Wire layout of Gordon Rogers' "grapevine radio" installation as of 1936. The transmissions originated from his home near Mauldin, South Carolina.]]
The first grapevine system was begun in the winter of 1930-1931 by a high school student, Gordon F. Rogers, who lived on farm in central Greenville county near [[Mauldin, South Carolina]]. The Rogers farm, unlike most of its neighbors, had electrical service. Gordon Rogers had shown an early aptitude for engineering, developing a clock that automatically turned on the farm's chicken coup lights at 3:00 a.m., as well as an automated system for watering the chickens.&lt;ref name="yen"&gt;"Yen for Electricity Takes SC Country Boy a Long Way: The Gordon Rogers Story", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', April 22, 1952, page 11-A.&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers also had an early interest in radio. Dissatisfied with a battery operated set, he successfully reconditioned a vacuum tube receiver that ran on AC electrical power. At this point he decided to also run a single-wire connection with a ground return from his receiver to a loudspeaker at the home of a neighbor who didn't have electricity. With this setup, whenever Rogers' radio was on the neighbor also heard what was being received. Word of this innovation quickly spread, and within a month lines had been run to seven nearby homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/ARCHIVE-RCA/RCA-Engineer/1980-07-08.pdf#page=71 "Bringing Radio to the Rural Home"] by G. F. Rogers, ''RCA Engineer'', July/August 1980 (Vol. 26, No. 1), pages 69-71. (americanradiohistory.com) &lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers' system was essentially sending one-way telephone signals over his own wires, but he had to use voltages far higher than that used by standard telephone lines, because he was sending not only audio but also the power needed to operate what would become hundreds of loudspeakers. His initial setup output was 2.5 watts, but as the system expanded this was increased in steps over time to 350-400 watts.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; This occasionally led to issues when his wires ran too close to standard telephone lines, which sometimes picked up the strong grapevine transmissions. Special steps had to be taken to eliminate interference with the telephone company's service.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers had to provide the wire, poles (often actually fence posts) and speakers needed to connect to the main system lines. Unskilled attempts by individuals to tap into the lines without paying generally caused service disruptions for nearby customers, which made it possible to locate and remove the improper connections. Although at first the service was provided for free, as the number of participants grew Rogers began charging a monthly 10 cent fee.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This charge was later raised to 25 cents, and at times a $1 surcharge was applied to finance replacement of sections of the transmission lines that needed to be upgraded from the original iron wire to higher quality materials. The system became profitable enough to finance Rogers' attendance at [[Clemson University|Clemson College]].&lt;ref name="yen"/&gt; In 1933, at the time of his college enrollment, the system had 5 miles (8 kilometers) of lines and 15 subscribers. Increasing demand, spurred by finding a source of affordable speakers ($2.85 each), expanded the number of connections to more than 200 within the next four months, and by June 1934 the transmission lines spanned 15 miles (24 kilometers). By around 1935, there were 600 homes connected to the grapevine service, including sites in [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]] and [[Laurens County, South Carolina|Laurens]] counties, located up to 24 miles (38 kilometers) distant from the Rogers farm distribution site. The infrastructure had also grown to 400 miles (645 kilometers) of transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) pages 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Programming was provided for about 12 hours each day. Rogers introduced a "local talent" program that featured live performances. A record player provided music for times when static made it difficult to receive the radio rebroadcasts that provided most of the schedule. Provisions were also made to make local announcements.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers (1980) page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a [[carrier current]] link from the system based at Ware Place allowed programming originating at that location to be picked up and concurrently transmitted by the Mauldin system.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the spring of 1936, Rogers, now a junior at Clemson, presented a paper, "Bringing Radio to the Rural Home", at a regional conference of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], which provided technical information about his innovation. His review won first place in its category.&lt;ref&gt;"Clemson Junior Contest Winner", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', April 23, 1936, page 5. Rogers' paper was republished in the July/August 1980 issue of ''RCA Engineer'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mauldin-based system remained in operation until the area received electrical service, shutting down around 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional installations==
===Ware Place===
Gordon Rogers' original system served northern [[Greenville County, South Carolina|Greenville county]]. A second wire network, originating from a small store in [[Ware Place, South Carolina]], was later established which provided an extensive program service for the southern part of the county. The store's owners, J. R. Chandler, Jr. and his cousin J. E. Chandler, became familiar with the Mauldin facility, and around 1934 arranged for Gordon Rogers and Sherman Fox to install similar distribution equipment at their store.&lt;ref&gt;''Images of America: Fork Shoals'', 2012, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandlers became active participants operating the system and supplying local programming. A studio, which included a piano and a pulpit, was built in the rear of the store. There was also a connection to the local school.&lt;ref&gt;"Augusta Road Life Livened by 'Grapevine'" by Hattie S. Sims, ''The Greenville (South Carolina) News'', March 3, 1957, page 1-D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscribers were initially charged 25 cents a month, which was later increased to 35 cents. Individual homes had to maintain their local wire connections, and purchase their own speakers: $3 to $5 for a small one, and $7 to $8 for a large one. An unusual additional benefit resulted from the discovery that, after the grapevine programming ended for the night, individual subscribers could hear each other if they spoke loudly into their speakers, resulting in a form of party-line communication. At its peak over 500 homes were connected. The system continued to run during World War II in order to supply war news, after which it was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hickory Tavern===
This installation helped launch the political career of Robert C. Wasson, who went on to become the state's Tax Chairman. The Wasson family ran a small store in [[Hickory Tavern, South Carolina]], located in southwest Laurens county. The needed equipment was purchased in March 1936 and the service was immediately popular. Later that year, when Robert Wasson announced what would be a successful candidacy for the [[South Carolina House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]], a newspaper report noted that the store he ran "is known as Wasson Brothers store, mill, and grapevine radio system serving 200 rural homes".&lt;ref&gt;"Robert C. Wasson Seeks House Seat", ''The (Columbia, South Carolina) State'', July 8, 1936, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers were charged 25 cents per month, and paid $6.50 for a small speaker or $10.50 for a large one — this fee included installation. Robert Wasson's mother, Effie Owens Wasson, handled most of the operational duties, and at its peak about 500 houses within a 12 mile (19 kilometer) radius were connected. Regular news reports and live entertainment made up an important part of the daily schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising over the facility was credited with helping to establish the Eaddy-Blakes corner drug store in Laurens, and a former pharmacy employee later wrote that "were Dr. Eaddy still living I'm sure he would attribute the biggest thing to his success in the drug business was this advertising... It cost him about a dollar a week and he had every person from the area as a regular customer in a short time". &lt;ref&gt;"Grapevine Radio System" (letter from R. A. Martin), ''The Greenville (South Carolina) News'', May 7, 1980, Section B, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wasson served seven terms in the South Carolina legislature. One of his political objectives was getting electrical service for his community, and after the rural electrification program reached his district the grapevine service ceased operations in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Grapevine': A Radio Started Career in Politics" by Jonathan W. Oatis (AP), ''Greenwood (South Carolina) Index-Journal'', August 11, 1980, page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saylors Crossroads===
Saylors Crossroads, South Carolina is a small community located in southeastern [[Anderson County, South Carolina|Anderson county]]. This system was inspired by the existence of the Ware Place operations, and was established by Charles Murdock in 1937. The Murdock family operated a general store, and a small studio was constructed in a building behind the store. The grapevine service was run by Selma Saylors, who was the twin sister of Charles Murdock's wife. Programming primarily consisted of relaying the transmissions of a local radio station, [[WAIM]] in Anderson. WAIM signed off at 9 p.m. each evening, and at that point the program source was switched to picking up "a station in Cincinnati" (presumably [[WLW]]). Local programming included the Sunday morning church services from Mount Bethel Baptist Church, carried from 1938 to 1940. 

Subscribers paid 45 cents a month, and chose between three speaker sizes: a smaller square-shaped speaker for $7.50, a larger square-shaped speaker for $9.50, and a heart-shaped speaker for $12.50. The speaker purchases financed the installation of the wire connection to the main transmission lines. At its peak, the service had 500 subscribers. This system ended operations in 1941, after the community received electric service.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) pages 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Williamston===
This system was operated by Carl Ellison, who owned a general store located at [[Williamston, South Carolina]] in east central Anderson county. It remained in operation for "seven or eight years", starting sometime in the 1930s and continuing through at least 1940. It had also been initially inspired by the Ware Place operations.

The Ellisons lived in a house behind the general store, and they converted their living room to serve as a studio for locally produced programming. The service cost 50 cents a month, and reached 700 subscribers. Like the Ware Place system, after the grapevine programming ended for the night individuals could be heard by other subscribers by speaking loudly into their speakers. The system featured ministers from Greenville who preached over the system on Friday nights. It also carried the Sunday services from the First Baptist Church in Williamston.&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) pages 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sites===
Gordon Rogers estimated that a total of ten to twelve grapevine operations were eventually installed, all located in South Carolina. Additional locations reportedly included Walhalla (located in the center of South Carolina's easternmost county, Oconee), another "near Mauldin", and one "across the Savannah river from Augusta, Georgia".&lt;ref&gt;Opt (1992) page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema ==

===Features===
Gross-out is a [[genre|subgenre]] of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully "tasteless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor]|first=Joe Garner ; foreword by Richard|title=Made you laugh! : the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy|year=2004|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-4695-2|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capsuto|first=Steven|title=Alternate channels : the uncensored story of gay and lesbian images on radio and television|year=2000|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-41243-5|pages=250|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or [[Schadenfreude]]. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|title=Film comedy|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=1-903364-35-3|pages=73|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie "edgy" and to generate media attention for it.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub.

Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 01.jpg|thumb|The classical appearance of the Harlequin stock character in the ''commedia dell'arte'' of the 1670s, complete with ''batte'' or "[[slapstick]]", a magic wand used by the character to change the scenery of the play ([[Maurice Sand]], 1860)]]

'''Harlequin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑr|l|ə|k|w|ɪ|n}}; {{lang-it|Arlecchino}} {{IPA-it|arlekˈkiːno|}}, {{lang-fr|Arlequin}} {{IPA-it|aʁləkɛ̃|}}, [[Old French]] ''Harlequin'') is the best-known of the ''[[zanni]]'' or comic servant characters from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''. The role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by [[Zan Ganassa]] in the late 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Duchartre 1929, p. 82; Laurence Senelick in Banham 1995, "Harlequin" p. 472; Rudlin &amp; Crick 2001, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; was definitively popularized by the Italian [[actor]] [[Tristano Martinelli]] in Paris in 1584–1585,&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2008, p. liv, note 32, citing Ferrone, Henke, and Gambelli.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a [[stock character]] after Martinelli's death in 1630.

The Harlequin is characterized by his chequered costume. His role is that of a light-hearted, nimble, and [[Tricky slave|astute servant]], often acting to thwart the plans of his master, and pursuing his own love interest, [[Columbina]], with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic [[Pierrot]]. He later develops into a prototype of the [[romantic hero]]. Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his [[trickster]] qualities, as well as his name,  from a mischievous "[[Devil in Christianity#Middle Ages|devil]]" character in medieval [[passion plays]].

The Harlequin character first appeared in England early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the [[Harlequinade]], developed in the early 18th century by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]].&lt;ref name="SenelickHarlequin" /&gt; As the Harlequinade portion of English dramatic genre [[pantomime]] developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]]. As developed by [[Joseph Grimaldi]] around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential such in [[Victorian England]] were [[William Payne (pantomimist)|William Payne]] and his sons the [[Payne Brothers]], the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s.

==Origin of the name==
{{further information|Herla|Erlking|Alichino (devil)}}
Although the origins of the Harlequin are obscure there are several theories for how the character came to be. One theory posits that the name is derived from a bird with polychromatic feathers called a ''Harle''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Oreglia 1968, pp. 56–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggest that the name Harlequin is taken from that of a mischievous "devil" or "demon" character in popular French [[passion play]]s. It originates with an [[Old French]] term ''herlequin'', ''hellequin'', first attested in the 11th century, by the chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], who recounts a story of a monk who was pursued by a troop of demons when wandering on the coast of [[Normandy]] (France ) at night.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical History Book VIII Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt;
These demons were led by a masked, club-wielding giant and they were known as ''familia herlequin'' (var. ''familia herlethingi''). This medieval French version of the Germanic [[Wild Hunt]], ''Mesnée d'Hellequin'', has been connected to the English figure of ''[[Herla|Herla cyning]]'' ("host-king"; German [[Erlkönig]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Rühlemann, ''Etymologie des wortes harlequin und verwandter wörter'' (1912).
See also Normand R. Cartier, ''Le Bossu désenchanté: Étude sur le Jeu da la Feuillée'', Librairie Droz, 1971,  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=ERF5OUazvTUC&amp;pg=PA132 p. 132].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hellequin was depicted as a black-faced emissary of the devil, roaming the countryside with a group of demons chasing the damned souls of evil people to Hell. The physical appearance of Hellequin offers an explanation for the traditional colours of Harlequin's red-and-black mask.&lt;ref name=Grantham&gt;Grantham, B., ''Playing Commedia, A Training Guide to Commedia Techniques'', (Nick Hern Books) London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ghosts in the Middle Ages: The Living and the Dead in Medieval Society | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | author=Jean-Claude Schmitt | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-226-73888-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name's origin could also be traced to a knight from the 9th century, Hellequin of Boulogne, who died fighting the Normans and originated a legend of devils.&lt;ref name="1924-2007. 56"&gt;Oreglia 1968, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantos XXI and XXII from Dante's ''Inferno'' there is a devil by the name of Alichino.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The similarities between the devil in Dante's ''Inferno'' and the Arlecchino are more than cosmetic and that the prank like antics of the devils in the aforementioned antics reflect some carnivalesque aspects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first known appearance on stage of Hellequin is dated to 1262, the character of a masked and hooded devil in ''Jeu da la Feuillière'' by [[Adam de la Halle]], and it became  a [[stock character]] in French passion plays.&lt;ref&gt;Lea 1934, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{anchor|Origins}}
[[File:A scene from the commedia dell' arte played in France before a noble audience - Ferrone 2014 fig34.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' played in France before a noble audience in 1571 or 1572 (Museum of [[Bayeux]]). [[Pantalone]] is front and center, while just to the right and slightly behind is '''Harlequin''' in motley costume, "the oldest known version of Harlequin's costume."&lt;ref name=SterlingDuchartre&gt;Sterling 1943, p. 20; Duchartre 1929, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KatritzkyBayeux&gt;Katritzky 2006, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HyPeo62Fi8YC&amp;pg=PA140 pp. 140–143], confirms that the dating of the painting is generally accepted; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HyPeo62Fi8YC&amp;pg=PA236 p. 236]: "...this figure is still widely accepted as a depiction of Harlequin or [[Zan Ganassa]], although often with reservations."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The re-interpretation of  the "devil" stock character as a [[zanni]] character of the [[commedia dell'arte]]&lt;ref name=Rudlin1994&gt;Rudlin 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; took place in the 16th century in France.
[[Zan Ganassa]], whose troupe is first mentioned in [[Mantua]] in the late 1560s, is one of the earliest known actors suggested to have performed the part,&lt;ref name=SenelickHarlequin&gt;Laurence Senelick in Banham 1995, "Harlequin" p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; although there is "little hard evidence to support [it]."&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin &amp; Crick 2001, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganassa performed in France in 1571, and if he did play the part there, he left the field open for another actor to take up the role, when he took his troupe to Spain permanently in 1574.&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin &amp; Crick 2001, pp. 7–13. These authors speculate that Ganassa may have dropped the role in Spain, since apparently he gained too much weight to perform the required acrobatics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest depictions of the character are a 1570-1571 Flemish painting in the Museum of [[Bayeux]]&lt;ref name=SterlingDuchartre/&gt;&lt;ref name=KatritzkyBayeux/&gt; and several woodblock prints probably dating from the 1580s in the Fossard collection, discovered by Agne Beijer in the 1920s among uncatalogued items in the [[Nationalmuseum Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky 2006, pp. 107–108; Beijer &amp; Duchartre 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compositions de rhétorique de Mr. Don Arlequin, 1601, p01 (title page Arlechin) - Gallica 2010 (adjusted).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tristano Martinelli]]'s Harlequin costume as depicted in his ''Compositions de rhétorique'', 1601]]

[[Tristano Martinelli]] is the first actor definitely known to have used the name 'Harlequin' (or 'Arlequin') for the ''secondo zanni'' role, and he probably first performed the part in France in (or just before) 1584 and only later brought the character to Italy, where he became known as Arlecchino.&lt;ref&gt;Lea 1934, pp. 79–84; Katritzky 2006, pp. 102–104; Andrews 2008, pp. xxvi–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; The motley costume is sometimes attributed to Martinelli, who wore a linen costume of colourful patches, and a hare-tail on his cap to indicate cowardice.  Martinelli's Harlequin also had a black leather [[domino mask|half-mask]], a moustache and a pointed beard. 
He was very successful, even playing at court and becoming a favourite of [[Henry IV of France]], to whom he addressed insolent monologues (''Compositions de Rhetorique de Mr. Don Arlequin'', 1601).&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Charney (ed.), ''Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Og4ntxFQP2cC&amp;pg=PA239 p. 239].&lt;/ref&gt;
Martinelli's great success contributed to the perpetuation of his interpretation of the zanni role, along with the name of his character, after his death in 1630, among others, by  [[Nicolò Zecca]], active c. 1630 in [[Bologna]] as well as [[Turin]] and Mantua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boni |first=Filippo de' |year=1852| title=Biografia degli artisti ovvero dizionario della vita e delle opere dei pittori, degli scultori, degli intagliatori, dei tipografi e dei musici di ogni nazione che fiorirono da'tempi più remoti sino á nostri giorni.

The character was also performed in Paris at the [[Comédie-Italienne]] in Italian by [[Giovan Battista Andreini]] and [[Angelo Costantini]] (c. 1654–1729) and in French as ''Arlequin'' in the 1660s by {{Interlanguage link multi|Dominique Biancolelli|it|vertical-align=sup}} (1636–1688), who combined the zanni types, "making his Arlecchino witty, neat, and fluent in a croaking voice, which became as traditional as the squawk of [[Pulcinella|Punch]]."&lt;ref name=SenelickHarlequin/&gt; 
The Italians were expelled from France in 1697 for satirizing [[King Louis XIV]]'s second wife, [[Madame de Maintenon]],&lt;ref&gt;Donald Roy in Banham 1995, "Comédie-Italienne" pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; but returned in 1716 (after his death), when [[Tommaso Antonio Vicentini]] ("Thomassin", 1682–1739) became famous in the part.&lt;ref name=Rudlin1994/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Senelick in Banham 1995, "Vicentini" p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt; The rhombus shape of the patches arose by adaptation to the Paris fashion of the 17th century by   Biancolelli.

==Characteristics and dramatic function==
[[File:Tivoli Gardens - Harlequin.jpg|thumb|upright|Harlequin at the [[Pantomimeteatret|Pantomime Theatre]] in [[Tivoli Gardens]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark ]]

=== Physicality ===
The primary aspect of Arlecchino was his physical agility.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grantham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudlin1994" /&gt; He was very nimble and performed the sort of acrobatics the audience expected to see. The character would never perform a simple action when the addition of a [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]], somersault, or [[flip (acrobatic)|flip]] would spice up the movement.&lt;ref name="1924-2007. 56"/&gt;
{{quote|By contrast with the 'first ''zanni'''  Harlequin takes little or no part in the development of the plot. he has the more arduous task of maintaining the even rhythm of the comedy as a whole. He is therefore always on the go, very agile and more acrobatic than any of the other Masks|Oreglia, Giacomo&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;}}
Early characteristics of Arlecchino paint the character as a second zanni servant from northern Italy with the paradoxical attributes of a dimwitted fool and an intelligent trickster.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Arlecchino is sometimes referred to as putting on a show of stupidity in a metatheatrical attempt to create chaos within the play.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scuderi|first=Antonio|year=2000|title=Arlecchino Revisited: Tracing the Demon from the Carnival to Kramer and Mr. Bean.|url=|journal=Theatre History Studies|volume=20|pages=143–155|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, Arlecchino is described as wearing a costume covered in irregular patches, a hat outfitted with either a rabbit or fox's tail, and a red and black mask.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The mask itself is identified by carbuncles on the forehead, small eyes, a snub nose, hollow cheeks, and sometimes bushy brows with facial hair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arlecchino is  often depicted as having a wooden sword hanging from a leather belt on his person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Aside from his acrobatics, Arlecchino is also known for having several specific traits such as: 
* Appearing humpbacked without artificial padding
* The ability to eat large amounts of food quickly
* Using his wooden sword like a fan
* A parody of ''[[bel canto]]''
and several other techniques.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Speech ===
One of the major distinctions of ''commedia dell'arte'' is the use of regional dialects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Arlecchino's speech evolved with the character. Originally speaking in a Bergamo dialect, the character adopted a mixture of French and Italian dialects when the character became more of fixture in France so as to help the performers to connect to the common masses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Dramatic function ===
Various troupes and actors would alter his behaviour to suit style, personal preferences, or even the particular [[scenario]] being performed. He is typically cast as the servant of an ''[[innamorato]]'' or ''[[vecchio]]'' much to the detriment of the plans of his master. Arlecchino often had a love interest in the person of [[Columbina]], or in older plays any of the [[Soubrette]] roles, and his lust for her was only superseded by his desire for food and fear of his master. Occasionally, Arlecchino would pursue the innamorata, though rarely with success, as in the ''Recueil Fossard'' of the 16th century where he is shown trying to woo Donna Lucia for himself by masquerading as a foreign nobleman. He also is known to try to win any given lady for himself if he chances upon anyone else trying to woo her, by interrupting or ridiculing the new competitor. His sexual appetite is essentially immediate, and can be applied to any passing woman.&lt;ref&gt;Rudlin 1994, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Anchor|Truffaldino|Guazetto|Zaccagnino|Bagatino}}

Between the 16th and 17th centuries Arlecchino gained some function as a politically aware character. In the ''Comèdie itlaienne'' Arlecchino would parodie French tragedies as well comment on current events.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Variants ==
[[File:Cezanne Harlequin.JPG|thumb|upright|''Harlequin'', 1888–1890, [[Paul Cézanne]]]]
Duchartre lists the following as variations on the Harlequin role:

'''[[Trivelino]]''' or '''Trivelin.''' Name is said to mean "Tatterdemalion." One of the oldest versions of Harlequin, dating to the 15th century. Costume almost identical to Harlequin's, but had a variation of the 17th century where the triangular patches were replaced with moons, stars, circles and triangles.  In 18th century [[France]], Trivelino was a distinct character from Harlequin.  They appeared together in a number of comedies by [[Pierre de Marivaux]] including [[L'Île des esclaves]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Oreglia 1968, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truffa, Truffaldin or Truffaldino.''' Popular characters with Gozzi and Goldoni, but said to be best when used for improvisations. By the 18th century was a Bergamask caricature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Guazzetto.''' In the seventeenth century, a variety of anonymous engravings show Guazzetto rollicking, similar to Arlechino. He wears a fox's brush, a large three-tiered collarette, wide breeches, and a loose jacket tied tightly by a belt. He also dons a neckerchief dropped over the shoulders like a small cape. Guazzetto's mask is characterized with a hooked nose and a mustache. His bat is shaped like a scimitar-esque sword.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchartre 1929, pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zaccagnino.''' Character dating to the 15th century.

'''Bagatino.''' A juggler.

==English harlequinade and pantomime==
The Harlequin character came to England early in the 17th century and took center stage in the derived genre of the [[Harlequinade]], developed in the early 18th century by the Lincoln's Fields Theatre's actor-manager [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], who played the role under the name of Lun.&lt;ref name=SenelickHarlequin/&gt; As the Harlequinade portion of English [[pantomime]] developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character [[Harlequinade#clown|Clown]].

Two developments in 1800, both involving [[Joseph Grimaldi]], greatly changed the pantomime characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Harlequin in His Element|last=Mayer III|first=David|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimaldi starred as Clown in [[Charles Dibdin the younger|Charles Dibdin's]] 1800 pantomime, ''Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100&lt;/ref&gt; For this elaborate production, Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was "garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs," instead of the tatty servant's outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London.&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt; Later the same year, at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], in ''Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona.'' Harlequin was modified to become "romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous", leaving Grimaldi's mischievous and brutish Clown as the "undisputed agent" of chaos, and the foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who retained stylized dance poses.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell Stott, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential such pair in [[Victorian England]] were the [[Payne Brothers]], active during the 1860s and 1870s, who contributed to 20th-century "slapstick" comedy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8014">{{main|Music of Madagascar}}
The ''hiragasy'' (''hira'': song; ''gasy'': Malagasy) is a [[music of Madagascar|musical tradition in Madagascar]] and particularly among the [[Merina]] ethnic group of the Highland regions around the capital of [[Antananarivo]]. 
The '''hiragasy''' is a day-long spectacle of music, dance, and ''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]'' oratory performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes.

==Origins and history==
[[File:HiragasyAmpefy.JPG|350px|thumb|right|Hiragasy performance near Ampefy, Madagascar, in July 2008.]]
The tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince [[Andrianampoinimerina]] first used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches (''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]''); these troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances.  The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval.&lt;ref name = Mauro&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mauro | first = Didier | title = Madagascar, l'opéra du peuple: anthropologie d'un fait social total: l'art Hira Gasy entre tradition et rébellion | publisher = KARTHALA Editions | location = Paris | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-2-84586-019-3|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiragasy troupes were used during the French colonial administration to communicate decrees and other information to the rural population in the Highlands, and as such troupe members were exempt from the forced labor requirements imposed on all other Malagasy.&lt;ref name = Edkvist&gt;{{Cite book | last = 
Edkvist | first = Ingela | title = The Performance of Tradition: An Ethnography of Hira Gasy Popular Theatre in Madagascar | publisher = Uppsala Universitet | location = Uppsala | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-91-554-4070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence from France in 1960, the hiragasy troupe was held up as an icon of traditional Malagasy culture, and began to find greater popularity along the coasts, although performances remain largely concentrated in the Highlands.  Aspiring politicians routinely hire hiragasy troupes to attract a crowd for their political speeches while campaigning.  While most troupes remain apolitical, some have opted to throw their support behind particular candidates to spectacular effect, as when former hiragasy member-cum-popstar [[Rossy (musician)|Rossy]] authored his 1995 song "Lera."  The song was critical of the [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] regime and was picked up by hiragasy troupes, who performed it across the island; the popularity of this song played a key role in mobilizing popular support for Zafy's impeachment.&lt;ref name = Mauro/&gt; The most famous troupe is [[Ramilison Besigara|Ramilison Fenoarivo]], Rossy's former troupe and staunch supporter of ex-President [[Didier Ratsiraka]].

==Structure and performance==
The performance of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such that there are certain similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar.  Among these are the order in which songs, dances and oratory are performed; how troupes are named (after the last name of the founding member and his/her town of origin); what costumes are worn (men typically wear straw hats, red coats and pants inspired by 19th century French military garb, and matching [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]] cloth sashes; women wear identical dresses designed after the style popular among ladies of the court during the [[list of Malagasy monarchs|Imperial period]]); and which instruments are used.  Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned.  Instead, the most common instruments are [[violin]]s, [[trumpet]]s, and [[snare drum|snare]] and [[bass drum]]s; the [[sodina]], [[accordion]], [[kabosy]] or [[clarinet]] may occasionally make an appearance.
[[File:Raholiarisoamadagascar.tif|thumb|right|alt=woman singing in red, green and white dress|Celebrated artist Raholiarisoa performing hiragasy at Mahamasina Stadium, Antananarivo]]
Hiragasy follow a specific structure under the direction of the troupe leader who is often the oldest member and responsible for the presentation of [[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]].  &lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' '''The Sasitehaka''': Over the course of approximately ten minutes, the male members of the troupe settle in the middle of the crowd of spectators as the snare and base drummers beat an accompanying militaristic rhythm.  The women are often to the side, completing their wardrobe and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2. The Mpikabary (Making Kabary)''':  One of the artists, often the troupe leader or oldest member of the group, will typically take off his straw hat and formally announce the beginning of the spectacle.  He will invite the female members of the troupe to come to the stage and then, after a short instrumental performance, the artist will take about five minutes to introduce the theme (''indray miditra'') of the show through ''kabary'' - a traditional type of formalized and poetic speech incorporating [[ohabolana]] (proverbs).   &lt;br /&gt;
'''3. The Renihira (Queen Song)''': The singers of the group form a circle facing outward and sing in harmony on the selected theme while the musicians, seated to the side, accompany them.  This theme is explored and developed at length, often for more than an hour, and the singers punctuate their message with emphatic hand gestures and facial expressions.  &lt;br /&gt;
'''4. The Dihy (Dance):''' The singers take a seat on the ground while the musicians play behind one, two or several dancers who will perform for approximately 15 minutes.  A [[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]] (''kabarindihy'') is presented on the topic of the dance to be performed and announces the title of the song that accompanies it.  There are two typical forms of dance that may be performed.  The true ''Dihy'' is typically performed by two dancers and the style is often acrobatic or takes its inspiration from martial arts.  The ''Tsikandihy'' or ''Dihy Irery'' is typically performed by one male dancer, occasionally accompanied by a female dancer.  The dancing segment is concluded with another short kabary that again touches on the theme of the performance and introduces the final part.&lt;br /&gt;
'''5. The Zanakira or Vakodrazana''':  A short performance lasting approximately 20 minutes that concludes the spectacle.&lt;ref name = Jourde&gt;{{Cite book | last = Raison-Jourde | first = Françoise | title = Bible et pouvoir à Madagascar au XIXe siècle | publisher = KARTHALA Editions | location = Paris | year = 1991 | pages = 714–732 | isbn = 978-2-86537-317-8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2G5SZ0XqM48C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate = March 27, 2011 | language = French}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

When two or more troupes are competing, each troupe takes its turn at each stage before all proceed to the next stage of the performance.  The troupes may all complete the entire cycle (this first round is termed the Vakisehatra) before repeating the entire process in a second round with a new set of themes (the second round being known as the Adi-Kiha) before all conclude with the Vakodrazana.  In these competitive performances, troupes may have as many as three or more themes to explore and the competition may last from early morning until nightfall.

==Plot==
In the near future, a Japanese scientist creates a powerful high-tech exoskeleton called "Infinite Stratos" (IS). Possessing technology and combat capabilities far surpassing that of any other arms system, the IS threatens to destabilize the world. Faced with such an overpowered weapon, the world's nations enact the "Alaska Treaty", stating that IS shall never be used for military combat purposes, and that the existing IS technology must be equally distributed to all nations, to [[Mutual assured destruction|prevent any one nation from dominating the others]]. However, sometime after the IS was introduced, the society undergone a drastic change. As IS can only be operated by women, there is a shift in the power balance between men and women, [[matriarchy|where women now dominate society over men.]]

Ten years after the IS was initially introduced, the world has entered a new age of peace. However, a 15-year-old male Japanese teenager named Ichika Orimura changes everything. During an accidental run-in with a hibernating IS suit, it is revealed that he possesses the innate ability to operate an IS - the only male in the world capable of doing so. Seeing his potential, the Japanese government forcibly enrolls the bewildered young man to attend the prestigious Infinite Stratos Academy, a multicultural academy where IS pilots from all over the world are trained. Thus, he starts a busy high school life surrounded by girls training to become expert IS pilots. While they seem to be enjoying their thrilling school life, the danger of looming threats and enemies are never too far away.

As the first male IS pilot, his new reputation has made him somewhat famous as many scientists and engineers would like to study him. He is mainly absent minded and oblivious to the feelings of the girls around him and seems to misunderstand their feelings towards him (though he seems to understand Houki's words during the second last episode of the first season when they almost kissed). Rumor has it that Ichika ''is'' aware of the girls' feelings for him, but avoids such affections due being the only male in school, and believes himself to have zero talent for being a suitable man.

Later on, Byakushiki undergoes Second Shift shortly after Houki Shinonono acquires her personal unit, Akatsubaki. In the resulting Second Shift form, named {{nihongo|'''Byakushiki Setsura'''|白式雪羅}}, it is equipped with a multi-function unit (A.I.) {{nihongo|'''Setsura'''|雪羅}}, which has: a high-caliber charged particle cannon, an energy claw for close-quarters combat, and an energy shield with the One-Off ability. In its Second Shift, Byakushiki also gains an increase in mobility through the addition of 4 large wing thrusters, enabling it to execute Double Ignition Boost.{{volume needed|date=March 2011}} In this Second Shift form, it, and Houki's Akatsubaki, are the most advanced IS ever made.

Her older sister, Tabane Shinonono, is the creator of the IS, though their relationship is strained. Six years ago, Ichika agreed to become her boyfriend if she could win the national kendo tournament of their grade. However, the day of the tournament is also the day the IS was introduced to the world. Due to the familial links to Tabane, Houki's family is placed under government protection and Houki is forced to withdraw from the kendo tournament. Since that incident, Houki resents her sister for moving her away from Ichika and abandoning their family.

:Despite not seeing him for a long time, Houki still harbors strong feelings of love for Ichika, as her continuing practice of kendo was her only link to him. She was his initial roommate before the arrivals of Charlotte Dunois and Tatenashi Sarashiki, and tends to get jealous when other girls are around him. Originally not possessing a personal IS, in Volume 3 she receives and pilots the {{Nihongo|'''Akatsubaki'''|紅椿||lit.

The Akatsubaki has a One-Off ability called {{nihongo|''Kenran Butō''|絢爛舞踏||"Magnificent Dance"}}, which allows Houki to replenish both her own and other IS's energy when she comes in contact with them. However, because she is still unskilled as a pilot and her compatibility with the IS is only at grade C, she is still considered to be on the same level of the other girls. As of Volume 7, her compatibility has risen to grade S.

:Cecilia is a first year student at the IS Academy and is an IS Cadet Representative of the United Kingdom. Her family is part of the [[British aristocracy]]. Her father, a spoiled and timid man who had little influence both inside and outside the Alcott family, makes her swear to never marry a weak man (a difficulty due to the [[#Plot|shift in social status]]). Upon losing her parents in a deadly train accident when she is 12 years old, Cecilia is forced to protect her family fortune from those who wish to claim a stake of it. After showing high IS aptitude, she makes a deal with the British government, who, in exchange for protecting her family's assets, wants her to go to the IS Academy as a Cadet Representative to gather data for their latest 3rd-generation model. She was almost defeated by Ichika for the position of class representative but won due to a technicality, but later cedes her position to Ichika. She soon starts to see him as a true man and falls in love with him. She pilots the {{nihongo|'''Blue Tears'''|ブルー・ティアーズ|Burū Tiāzu}} IS, a long-range sniper-class IS, which can deploy four remotely controlled "drones" (B.I.T.S.

The Blue Tears IS is also equipped with the {{nihongo|Starlight Mark III|スターライトmkIII|Sutāraito Māku Surī}}, a large laser rifle, and {{nihongo|Interceptor|インターセプター|Intāseputā}}, a short blade used for close-range combat.

:Lingyin is a first year student at the IS Academy, the class representative of her class and is an IS Cadet Representative of China. As with Houki Shinonono, Lingyin has been friends with Ichika Orimura since their early childhood. She has been in love with Ichika ever since he protected her against four school delinquents. Lingyin at first becomes extremely hostile to Ichika after he forgets the details of a promise they made as kids (in which it was implied; although not explicitly stated, that if she became an excellent cook, he would become her boyfriend). She is also called {{Nihongo|"Ling"|鈴|Rin|"Rin" in the English dub}}. Her family ran a Chinese restaurant that Ichika would often eat at before Ling's parents divorced and she moved back to China.

Charlotte initially calls herself {{nihongo|Charles Dunois|シャルル・デュノア|Sharuru Dunoa}}, posing as the second "male" IS pilot student that was transferred into Ichika's class. However, her plan is to spy on Ichika, discover how he is able to pilot an IS and acquire data from his IS (which at the time was considered the most advanced 3rd-generation unit). Because she enrolls as a male IS pilot, she is paired with Ichika as roommates since they are "both" guys. As a result of this arrangement, Ichika later discovers her true gender when he inadvertently walks in on her showering. Upon learning that Charlotte's father and his corporation used her to spy on him, Ichika decides to help protect her. She later falls in love with Ichika due to his bravery. She pilots the {{Nihongo|'''Rafale Revive Custom II'''|ラファール・リヴァイヴ・カスタムII|Rafāru Revaivu Kasutamu Tsū}} IS, a 2nd-generation custom multi-range IS possessing a wide array of interchangeable weapons allowing for fast battlefield adaptation and capable of performing the Ignition Boost. Her weapons, once called upon, can be used by another IS pilot as long as she grants permission. Due to her training to make her a convincing male prior to her entry to the IS Academy, Charlotte uses ''"[[Japanese pronouns|boku]]"'' (an informal male equivalent of "I") when referring to herself. Following the Silver Gospel Incident in later novels, Charlotte becomes Laura's roommate.

She has a red eye and long silver hair; but her most distinct feature being a black [[eyepatch]] covering her glowing-yellow left eye, the result of a failed nano-machine experiment meant to help her pilot an IS better. Laura was under Chifuyu's tutelage when the latter was an instructor for the German army following the 2nd Mondo Grosso, and holds Chifuyu in high regard for helping her and was her role model when she suffered a depression for not being the strongest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yumizuru|first=Izuru|title=IS〈インフィニット・ストラトス〉|trans-title=IS (Infinite Stratos)|volume=2|date=August 25, 2009|publisher=[[Media Factory]]|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-8401-2870-4|page=54|chapter=ルームメイトはブロンド貴公子|trans-chapter=The Roommate is a Blonde Gentleman|quote=もう私は教官ではないし、ここではお前も一般生徒だ。}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her current name is actually a code name given to her by the German military, as she was artificially created from human DNA. She has an elder sister, Chloe Chronicle, who is capable of infiltrating a person's mind through virtual reality via manipulate the modules around them.

:Laura pilots the {{Nihongo|'''Schwarzer Regen'''|「シュヴァルツェア・レーゲン|Shuvarutsea Rēgen|German for "Black Rain"}} IS, a medium-to-long-range artillery-type IS. The Schwarzer Regen possess several remotely guided tethers, which Laura uses to capture and restrain her opponents while she attacks them with a slow-firing but extremely powerful [[railgun]]. The Schwarzer Regen also possesses an "Active Inertial Canceller" (AIC), which can be used to stop the movement of projectiles and even another IS. While a very powerful defense, the canceller can only be used against one target at a time, and is only effective at very close range.

:Laura's original purpose for coming to the IS Academy is to punish Ichika, whom she blames for his sister withdrawing from the 2nd Mondo Grosso (unaware that Ichika was kidnapped at the time and Chifuyu withdrew in order to save him). She initially defeats Ling and Cecilia but struggles in the tournament against the pair of Ichika and Charlotte, as they had planned their attacks beforehand (unlike Laura, who does not excel with allies). After Charlotte beats her during the class tournament, the dormant VT-System within Laura's IS activates, causing her to go berserk. She is then stopped by Ichika, who also calms and console her in the Inter-IS subspace. After consoling her in the subspace, she realizes what Chifuyu sees in him and falls in love with him. Upon learning Ichika's strength is his freedom to choose and helping those around him and Chifuyu's advice, Laura decides to become Ichika's bodyguard to protect him against the other girls by kissing him in front of his class and professes that he is her "wife", a misunderstanding of her knowledge of Japanese culture, and she will not accept any objections.

The company that was developing her personal IS also produced the Byakushiki. Due to Ichika's rise in fame, the development of his IS unit was given priority over hers, and as a result, she harbors a resentment towards Ichika, not that he had anything to do with the decision. In addition, Kanzashi has always competed against her older sister and feels incompetent when compared to her. However, thanks to Ichika's efforts (unaware of Tatenashi's assistance until later), her IS the {{nihongo|'''Uchigane Nishiki'''|打鉄弐式|Uchigane Nishiki}} is made operational. Kanzashi falls in love with Ichika for his kindness in helping her, and her view towards Tatenashi changes when she realizes that she has been competing with an idealized conception of Tatenashi and comes to be more accepting of her own accomplishments.

She is the Academy's most powerful IS pilot (the position of Student Council President is only given to the strongest IS Academy student). She is assigned to protect Ichika after the Silver Gospel incident and used her position as president to become Ichika's roommate (much to Houki's jealousy). Tatenashi likes to flirt with Ichika, teasing him with her body and making him uncomfortable most of the time. She asked for his help in getting her younger sister, Kanzashi's, IS operational in time for the school competition. Afterwards, she may have developed feelings for him.

During her retirement, she looked after her brother and raised him by herself after their parents abandoned them at a young age. Despite her indifference towards Ichika, Chifuyu deeply cares for her brother, as she sees him as her only family. Chifuyu was also the one who enrolled Ichika to the IS Academy to keep him safe from other countries. Chifuyu once wielded Yukihira, a powerful IS energy blade now in Ichika's possession. Chifuyu was a close friend of Tabane Shinonono, which explains how their younger siblings became childhood friends. Tabane also implies (heavily) that Chifuyu piloted the {{nihongo|'''"White Knight"'''|白騎士|Shirokishi}}–the first ever developed IS that protected Japan from a massive missile attack 10 years prior to the series.

Tabane and Chifuyu's connections, is the reason Ichika and Houki became childhood friends. Despite her normally cheerful nature, she has a condescending view towards outsiders and strangers and will often treat anybody besides Chifuyu, Houki, and Ichika with disdain. Tabane has a thing for rabbits, hence the metal bunny ears on her head and the carrot pod she arrived in to give Houki her IS. During a conversation with Chifuyu she admits to having initially reprogrammed the first IS to be compatible for Ichika, however she doesn't know how the Byakushiki moves while Ichika is piloting it.

It is revealed, Madoka is a member of the Phantom Task organization, under the codename: M. She pilots the '''Silent Zephyrs''', a 3rd generation IS stolen from England and based on Cecilia's Blue Tears. It appears to be more advanced than its predecessor.

An '''innuendo''' is a [[wikt:hint|hint]], [[wikt:insinuation|insinuation]] or [[wikt:intimation|intimation]] about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging  (also called '''insinuation'''), that works obliquely by [[allusion]]. In the latter sense the intention is often to [[insult]] or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent.

According to the ''[[Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary]]'', an innuendo is "an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude", such as:'' "innuendos about her private life" ''or'' "The song is full of sexual innuendo".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo ''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094326/http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo |date=2015-05-18 }} (7th Edition; electronic version)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''sexual innuendo''' has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" [[double entendre]] by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: "We need to go deeper" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or a request to go deeper into an [[intimate part]].

In the context of [[Defamation|defamation law]], an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.

==Film, television and other media==
Comedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. [[British sitcoms]] and comedy shows such as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|title=Going down: 'Grace Bros' store closes|publisher=BBC News|date=February 1, 1999|quote=The innuendo was loud and clear|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227013009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|archivedate=February 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Round the Horne]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|title=A return to unalloyed joy|author=Dominic Cavendish|date=31 Oct 2003|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|quote=...a censor-baiting mixture of absurd spoofs, yarns, links and character-turns, laced with end-of-the-pier innuendo and erudite-infantile wordplay.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924212749/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|title=Only The Brits: Not Christmas Without Pantomime|publisher=NPR|date=December 25, 2011|quote=No panto is complete without a dose of smutty innuendo for the adults and some contemporary political jokes.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101101932/http://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Animal Flyer.jpg|thumb|A male cat paying a "call" on a female cat, who then serves up kittens, insinuating that the "result" of children is predicated on a male "catcall"]]

Numerous television programs targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies.

Many American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue.{{fact|date=January 2012}} Also, many radio shows, are notable for this.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

On ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media reform''' refers to proposed attempts to reform [[mass media]] towards an agenda which is more in tune with public needs and away from a perceived bias toward corporate, government or political biases. Media reform advocates also place a strong emphasis upon enabling those who are [[marginalized]] or semi-marginalized by their individual incomes, immutable characteristics or desperate conditions to possess access to means of publication and dissemination of information. They do not come from a concern with policy, or with a desire to democratize federal bureaucracies and regulations.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

A related concept, '''media justice''', refers to an analytical framework and a regional, grassroots movement led by historically disenfranchised communities to transform media and cultural production, rights and policy in the service of [[social justice]]. The Media Justice Framework offers a new way to understand and redistribute media power to achieve a fair and accessible information and cultural apparatus that fulfils its promise to inform the public, watchdog power, and serve all segments of the public equally.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Movement for Media Justice believes that media production and distribution must be under the control of communities, not companies; and that achieving social justice victories requires a secondary strategy for media policy change.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== History ==

Media reform movement coincides with [[media democracy]] as a concept and is interlinked with the [[agenda setting theory]]. In 1922, in his book, ''[[Public Opinion]]'', [[Walter Lippmann]] argued that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. He stated that the media has an ability to influence the thoughts and opinions of the members of public consuming the content. He did not use the term "agenda setting", but scholars have come to agree that was the core concept.&lt;ref&gt;Lippmann, W (1922). Public opinion. New York: Harcourt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the media reform movement there is the traditional media reform movement which has its roots in the broadcasting and freedom of press movements and has been linked with the feminist movement as well as racial and gender justice.{{cn|date=October 2018}} However, mainstream media reform groups have so far steered clear from acknowledging media reform’s roots in content work, including the legal victory by the United Church of Christ that forced changes in hiring and reporting practices in Mississippi television journalism.{{cn|date=October 2018}} This is said to be done in order to maintain the support of conservative patrons and to downplay the importance of more controversial critical junctures that have shaped the way media reform movement is today.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

It has also been affected by federal policy advocacy, whereby media outlets and governments alter their broadcasting practices to attract powerful allies and making their agenda the national public agenda. Funders provide financial support that support the media outlets and drives business.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The traditional media reform movement has however undergone some significant changes with the rise of [[citizen journalism]], whereby citizens play an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, S. and Willis, C. "We Media: How Audiences are Shaping the Future of News and Information." 2003, The Media Center at the American Press Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern media reform movement relies heavily on the Internet and the numerous social networking tools it offers and the Internet coupled with citizen curated content has led to a decrease in the popularity of traditional media networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Leary|first= D.|year=2009|title=Decline of Traditional Media|url=http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/decline_of_traditional_media|publisher=mercatornet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==

The Canadian media reform movement has its roots in the 1930s, Canadian Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom. Highlighting the threats of cultural Americanisation and excessive commercialism, and calling for universal radio service that would not be viable through market forces alone, the Canadian Radio League assembled a blue-ribbon coalition to persuade a Conservative government to create the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hackett|first=R.|year=2014|title=Media Democratisation in Canada: A Movement Comes Into Its Own|url=http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/media_democratisation_in_canada_a_movement_comes_into_its_own|publisher=newleftproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notable sites and advocates of the movement in Canada include thetyee.ca, the Media Co-op, Media Democracy Days, OpenMedia.ca, the Aboriginal Peoples Television and print outlets such as [[Canadian Dimension]].

Launched in 2001 and originating in Vancouver, British Columbia, Media Democracy Days are organized around the country with the aim of knowing, being and changing the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediademocracyproject.ca/|title=The Media Democracy Project|work=Media Democracy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; They encourage citizen journalism and expect netizens to take responsibility for bringing the change they wish to see in media. It is part of the Media Democracy Project that aims to create a significant presence for noncommercial media in Canada.

OpenMedia.ca was created in 2007 to celebrate two of the world’s foremost critics of media propaganda, Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky, and since then it has managed to earn national resonance and policy impact. It is by far the leader in the Media Reform movement in Canada.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The movement's focus in Canada has been predominantly on the not for profit sector. There is overwhelming recognition of the importance of the Internet in NGO work, and unanimous endorsement of the principle of [[net neutrality]] as a regulatory underpinning for equitable and affordable access to the Internet. Trade unions and independent media, arts and culture groups, particularly those representing media and cultural workers, are core advocates for democratic communications. Other groups, especially those concerned with human rights, are also supportive.

In a 2010 survey by Open Media, Canadian mainstream media’s democratic performance has been rated as poor or very poor by Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hackett|first1=Robert A.|last2=Anderson|first2=S.|year=2010|title=Revitalizing a Media Reform Movement in Canada|url=https://openmedia.ca/sites/openmedia.ca/files/SSRC%20Report(2).pdf|format=PDf|publisher=openmedia.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many NGOs report positive relationships with particular media, NGOs appear to have a more favorable view of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and of independent media, which relies heavily on citizen journalism and has led to the rise of blogger culture.&lt;ref&gt;Geert, L. 2007. "''Zero Comments: Blogging and Critical Internet Culture''." Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; An overwhelming majority of NGOs agree that the quality and diversity of Canadian journalism affects their organization’s work. There is an encouraging culture of collaboration amongst NGOs in the sectors surveyed. Values such as openness, accessibility, participation, choice, diversity and innovation may resonate well with NGOs in Canada. Media reform organizations should consider some kind of expansive institutional structure, such as an association or network that can facilitate communication and engagement with a broad and diverse array of organizations.

== Future ==
Media reform movement is a positive step towards a netizen curated web and has given rise to citizen journalism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Communications guru [[Frank Luntz]] has claimed that "A compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth. I have seen how effective language attached to policies that are mainstream and delivered by people who are passionate and effective can change the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, Makani T. Mainstreams and Margins: A Critical Look at the Media Reform "Story". 2009. The Praxis Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Statements such as the ones by Mr. Luntz, encourage people and provide hope that we can be part of a fair and democratic media system. One that not only reports what the public wants but also tells the truth and does not use agenda setting theory for mere popularity.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6028">'''Metaphoric criticism''' is one school of [[rhetoric]]al analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.

==Origins==
The term "metaphor" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in ''The Elements of Rhetoric'', defines metaphor as "an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'"&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, James. (1878). "The Elements of Rhetoric." New York: Harper and Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally "display" and "magnet" are not considered synonyms. However, in using "magnet" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the "display" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.

In a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of [[Kenneth Burke]] and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by [[George Lakoff]].

==Application==
Metaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled "Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor," George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a "war" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a "crime" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the "war" metaphor: "The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Evan Frisch. (2006) "[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060927081227/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.

Critics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the "enemy" that the bear represents.

==Conduction==
In ''Rhetorical Criticism'',&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K. (1995). ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.'' 2nd edition. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:

# First, the critic reads or views the entire artifact with specific attention to its context.
# Second, to the critic isolates the metaphor(s) within the text, both obvious and more subtle substitutions of meaning. Here Foss invokes Max Black's interaction theory of "tenor" (the principal subject or focus) and "vehicle" (secondary subject or frame for the metaphor), a method to analyze ways in which the related dissimilar objects actually share similar characteristics.
# Third, the critic sorts the metaphors and look for patterns of use within the text. The more comprehensive the text, the longer this step will take.
# The critic analyzes the metaphor(s) or groups of metaphors in the artifact to reveal how their structure may affect the intended audience. Foss writes, "Here, the critic suggests what effects the use of the various metaphors may have on the audience and how the metaphors function to argue for a particular attitude toward the ideas presented."

'''Movie Theaters and hand painted Movie Posters in Ghana''' are a cultural component of this West African state.

== History ==
In the 1980s, thanks to the invention of video recorders, the first small cinemas came up in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe Ernie, Clive Barker: Extreme Canvas. Handpaintedd movie posters from Ghana. Los Angeles, Dilettante Press/Kesho Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sign painters ==
The artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Michelle: Shocking Images: Ghanaian Painted Posters. In: Ghana, Yesterday and Today, Musée Dapper 2003, pp.353-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New developments ==
Since Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like [[Paa Joe]] or [[Kudjoe Affutu]] in painting their [[Fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]], [[Figurative palanquin|palanquins]] and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo,&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, Regula: Hors-Champs. Genèse de l'affiche de l'exposition. Exh. Cat. Hors-champs, Atelier PréTexte Neuchâtel, 2013, pp. 218-221.&lt;/ref&gt; also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of [[contemporary African art]] where they are getting more and more attention.&lt;ref&gt;Barlovic, Ingo, Wolfgang Stäbler: Faszinierende Werbekunst: Gemalte Filmplakate aus Ghana.

'''''My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad''''' was a reality sports TV show on [[NBC]] that premiered on February 18, 2008. The show was produced by [[Mark Burnett]], producer of other shows like ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', and ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'', and was hosted by actor [[Dan Cortese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN2952964420080129 |title=Two more games in play at NBC from Mark Burnett |accessdate=2008-02-02 | work=Reuters | date=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four teams of children and their fathers competed in each episode, with the winning team having the chance to win up to $50,000.

The series was cancelled on April 2, 2008 after [[NBC]] announced its 2008-2009 schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-nbc2008-09schedule,0,68896.story NBC Makes Big Plans for '08-'09 - Network takes gamble on year-round programming - Zap2it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Four dads, paired up with their kids, compete in each episode, playing in stunts and answering questions, in what may have been a cross between ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'' and ''American Gladiators''.

;Round 1 - My Dad is Faster: All four teams participate in a stunt that tests how fast Dad is. For example, on the first episode, the fathers had two minutes to destroy desks, and putting each piece of their desk into a bin to determine the weight. The team who has scored the least in that round is given a 15-second penalty carried into the next round.

;Round 2 - My Dad is Stronger: This tests how strong the dads really are. For example, in most episodes, they have to swing their kids into an oversized dartboard, with their kids carrying large foam darts with sticky pads on the bottom (they only counted if the darts were simply put on the board, throwing them didn't count, and if a dart fell off, it still counted [note: As of the third episode, throwing a dart now counts, and a dart falling off doesn't count]). The team that scores the least in the round is eliminated and sent to "The Garage", but they leave with an [[Xbox 360]] as a consolation prize.

;Round 3 - My Dad is Smarter: Another test—this time to determine how smart Dad is. A question and four choices appear on a video screen to their left. The child rings in, but it's the dad who has to answer. A right answer earns 1 point, but a wrong answer causes the other teams to have the chance to answer from the remaining choices. The first two teams to score 3 points move on to the final round, while the losers get sent to the Garage with the Xbox 360.

;Final Round - My Dad is Braver: For the final round, this tests how brave Dad is. An example from the first episode is when each father had two minutes to score points by shooting newspapers from an air gun through windows worth 100 and 500 points. The opponent has to dodge the windows and make sure the newspaper doesn't break them. The winning team goes to the bonus round to play for $50,000 (and it all depends on how well a dad knows his son/daughter) while the losers get the Xbox 360.

;Bonus Round - My Dad Knows Me Better: Before the round begins, the winning team earns a mountain bike and the Xbox 360 no matter what happens in the game. In the bonus round, similar to another NBC game show [[Amnesia (game show)|Amne$ia]], the father was asked up to six questions about his child, earning his team $10,000 for each right answer. Unlike most primetime game shows of this era (not counting another NBC show, ''[[The Singing Bee (U.S. game show)|The Singing Bee]]''), a wrong answer does not take away money. The round ends when they hit $50,000 or two wrong answers have been given. During the show's run, no one walked away with the full $50,000. The most ever won was $40,000. Also, not one team has failed to answer any question correctly, thus winning no money.

==Winners==
*Mark and Jim Fier (defeated Teams Kirby, Rutherford, and Kang)
*Leo and Christopher Li (defeated Teams Sass, Kabat, and Stephenson)
*Rick and Dustin Avila (defeated teams Grayston, Martin, and Basile)
*Dave and Mickey Cortez (Philippines version at GMA 7 hosted by Paulo Contis episode 11 defeated teams Carbungco, Salas, Gonzales)

==Replacement==
During the third episode's first-round stunt, "Uphill Battle" (in which dads had three minutes to push as many balls up a hill into giant holes), contestant Al Gaines had a very strong lead over his opponents at the start, but towards the end, he ended up struggling to get more balls down the holes, even at the urging of his son. At the end of the round, it was quite apparent that Gaines was suffering from a heart attack, as teaser trailers show him being rushed from the Sony studios to an ambulance. According to the rules, if a father or child is unable to compete, a replacement family takes their place. The replacement family was the Gavero Family.

'''Plot drift''' is a phenomenon in storytelling in which the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the story deviates from its apparent initial direction. The phenomenon can affect written works, although it is often more noticeable in performed media such as [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s. Plot drift is generally (though not always) seen as contrary to good storytelling technique.

A sign of plot drift can be the increased introduction of new characters and settings near the end of a story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

A contrary literary technique might include the apparent introduction of plot drift, only to later reveal a connection to the rest of the story.{{examples|date=June 2013}}

The '''politico-media complex''' ( '''PMC''', also referred to as the '''political-media complex''' ) is a name that has been given to the close, systematized, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]-like network&lt;ref name="network"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hacking reveals power network|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14846456 |publisher=[[The BBC]]|date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2011|quote=The story of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal has revealed a web of links between senior figures within politics, the police and the media.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of relationships between a [[Sovereign state|state's]] [[politics|political]] and [[ruling class]]es, its [[media industry]], and any interactions with or dependencies upon [[interest group]]s with other domains and agencies, such as [[law]] (and its enforcement through the [[police]]&lt;ref name="filkin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Filkin report: Police warned over press links|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16411329 |publisher=[[The BBC]] |date=January 4, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2012|quote=The "close relationship" between parts of Scotland Yard and the media has caused "serious harm", a report says.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[corporation]]s and the [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]].

There is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of "traditional" [[mainstream media]] [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="lse0"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early media institutions==
Before [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. [[Town criers]] spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Media History |last=Fellow |first=Anthony |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Rosenberg |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-495-56775-2 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7THGKyvBXScC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=%22town+criers%22+polical+media&amp;ei=3IgcS67kN57IzAT2k5iEDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. [[Corantos]], which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Catherine. "Inventing the News." Engines of our Ingenuity. University of Houston. 2005. http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1983.htm. Dec. 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print==

===Global print media===
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights". United Nations. 2009. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ UN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the international papers present in the world today are national papers re-edited for a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Because of this, there can be biases based on nationality.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In any publication there is some sort of bias just from what news is covered and what stories are shown at the forefront of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Tunstall, Jeremy. pg 12. The Media In Britain. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}

Although print media in the West has suffered from declining advertising trends,&lt;ref name="printdecline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fontevecchia | first=Agustino | title=New York Times Agonizes As Print Media Ad Revenues Continue To Slide | website=Forbes | date=12 September 2011 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2011/09/12/new-york-times-agonizes-as-print-media-ad-revenues-continue-to-slide/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; many newspapers and magazines in the [[Middle East]] continue to do well.&lt;ref&gt;"Middle East Newspapers Struggle in New Age".

Routledge. New York. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the independence from political influence, and dependability of newsprint is questionable in many countries. The [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="press freedom index"&gt;"Press Freedom Index 2009". [http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf RSF.org] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/616iLWBGp?url=http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/classement_en.pdf |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The West====
[[File:Newspapers-20080928.jpg|thumb|[[Newspapers]], as seen here, are easily available in many parts of the world.]]

Newspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Caroline. Ross, Karen. “Women and media: international perspectives”. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters Without Borders, an international [[non-governmental organization]] that promotes [[freedom of the press]], produces an annual [[Press Freedom Index]] assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, "It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us."&lt;ref name="press freedom index"/&gt;

====Asia====
The press is censored in the People's Republic of China by the [[Golden Shield Project]], known colloquially as the [[Great Firewall of China]].&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Sentinel: News Media and Governance Reform |last=Norris |first=Pippa |authorlink=Pippa Norris |author2=World Bank Staff |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Bank Publications]] |location= |isbn=978-0-8213-8200-4 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzFVxDDhfnkC&amp;pg=PA360 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reporters Without Borders'' ranks [[Media of the People's Republic of China|China's press situation]] as "very serious," the worst possible ranking on their five-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;"The News by Country".

====The Middle East and North Africa====
Middle Eastern print media is mainly paid for by private funders, either a specific family or specific government party.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines have been accused of having obvious political ties.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. pg 11. The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years. Britain.

===Struggles===
Where newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan, Robert. The Krugman Paradox: newspaper websites' inability to generate economically sustainable advertising revenue. New York University. Fall 2008. pg. 18.[http://metaprinter.com/Projects/Robert_Ivan_MAthesis_2008NYU.pdf MA Thesis PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, [[print press]] has been described as declining.&lt;ref name="printdecline" /&gt; Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|title=Conservative Koch Brothers Turning Focus to Newspapers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/business/media/koch-brothers-making-play-for-tribunes-newspapers.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are "isolated and out of touch" and motivated by commercial interests.&lt;ref name="2004att"&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/public-attitudes/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt;

Some{{who|date=June 2013}} have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. [[Harvard]] Professor Thomas Patterson has said: "What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both. My sense is that, like it or not, the future of news is going to be in the electronic media, but we don't really know what that form is going to look like."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Juston. "Young Adults Are Giving Newspapers Scant Notice". July 16, 2007. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/business/media/16habits.html?_r=0 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==

===History of political radio===
[[File:RCA Radiola 25 - raw.jpg|thumb|An [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] Radiola, manufactured 1925.]]

The early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Douglas B. Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States. pg 26. The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the [[Radio Act of 1912]], which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Regulate Radio Communication, August 13, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation,{{OR|date=June 2013}} including the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which established the [[Federal Radio Commission]] and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 632, February 23, 1927, 69th Congress. An Act for the regulation of radio communications, and for other purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. [[Jonathan Reed Winkler]], a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.”&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Jonathan Reed. Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I. pg. 2. [[Harvard University Press]]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pgs. 10, 13-16. [[Columbia University Press]]. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924{{OR|date=June 2013}} when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pg. 18. Columbia University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of radio users exploded, by 1935 about 2 in 3 American homes owned a radio.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, Steven E. "Golden Age of Radio,1935-1950" [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/radio2.html Sandiego.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians quickly learned to reach these huge audiences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [[Fireside Chats]] are an example of the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In his series of informal broadcasts from 1933 to 1944, Roosevelt developed a comforting rapport with the American public.&lt;ref&gt;"Treasures of American History: The Great Depression and World War II."

Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of [[propaganda]]. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as [[Tokyo Rose]]. These women hosted anti-American programming intended to lower American soldiers' morale and illustrate the use of governments' use of the media to influence the public, or their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;"Famous Cases: Iva Toguri d'Aquino and 'Tokyo Rose.'"

[https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/rose/rose.htm FBI.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people, such as [[Iva Toguri D'Aquino]] and Allied prisoners of war, were forced against their will to participate in these programs and worked hard to help Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iva Toguri|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article652271.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Willis Conover 1969.jpg|thumb|left|[[Willis Conover]], host of the [[Voice of America|VOA's]] Music USA program, 1969.]]
After WWII and throughout the [[Cold War]] era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the [[Voice of America]], founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era "public diplomacy," which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon Robert. "Channeling the Cold War: U.S. Overseas Broadcasting". The Foreign Service Journal. pg. 58. October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, President Harry S. Truman described the Cold War conflict as a "struggle, above all else, for the minds of men," which the American people would win by getting "the real story across to people in other countries." in other words, embracing the politico-media complex and using it to influence foreign listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Lyn. McLean, David. Media and Society in the Twentieth Century: a historical introduction. pg. 107. Wiley Blackwell. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice of America, operating under the authority of the [[United States Information Agency]], supported programming in forty five languages, broadcasting over 400 hours of programming a week.

===Modern political radio===
The Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the [[Rush Limbaugh Show]], which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as "America's Truth Detector," the "Doctor of Democracy," and the "Most Dangerous Man in America."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rush Limbaugh Show." Premier Radio Networks. [http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/about_the_show.guest.html RushLimbaugh.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rush Limbaugh Show has hosted numerous politicians, illustrating that politicians still use the radio to affect public opinion and the political process.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} The [[Air America Media]] company, provides progressive political commentary and news coverage and has described itself as the "most recognized progressive talk radio network, providing an independent and unfiltered voice to a grateful listening nation."&lt;ref&gt;"About Air America."

==Film==

===National cinema===
One of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is '''[[national cinema]]''', for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, Mette, and Scott MacKenzie, eds. Introduction. ''Cinema and Nation''. By Hjort and MacKenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jimmy. "Is National Cinema Mr. MacGuffin?" International Films The Institute of Communications Studies, [[University of Leeds]], UK. Available at [http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22 Leeds.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, Charles and John A. Hall. "The Sociological Scope of National Cinema." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p.22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural politics===
Ulf Hedetoft has observed, "In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"&gt;Hedetoft, Ulf. "Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its "national-cultural currency" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a "positive admixture" to other countries' cultures and identities or a "model for emulation."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt; He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt;

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"&gt;Furhammar, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

Such British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the "masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from "[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]
When sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{OR|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"&gt;Furhammar, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the "reality" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The Führer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.&lt;ref&gt;Furhammar, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in "Breaking into the Movies," is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"&gt;Giroux, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, "We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values."&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"/&gt;

Though feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"/&gt;

===Anti-politics in film===
Despite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to "develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's "[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]" 1939.]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; After the hero of ''[[John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Lindholm and Hall observe that "the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"&gt;Lindholm, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt; Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt;

===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===
While films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor-politicians===
{{Main article|List of actor-politicians}}

==Television==

===Role of television in United States presidential elections===
The [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"&gt;Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;

Rick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that "politicians have repeatedly misled voters" by "[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation."&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;
[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]

Through setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.&lt;ref name="agenda" /&gt; When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence on religion via television===
In his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in "shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present" in India.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;Rajagopal, Arvind. "Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India." Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that "television profoundly changes the context of politics".&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;24)&lt;/sup&gt;

The epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/sup&gt; This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.

Central to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt; This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.

===Television and politics around the world===
In the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"&gt;Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"/&gt;

Another group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are "conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information."&lt;ref&gt;Neuman et al., 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;60&lt;/ref&gt; They set the parameters "in which citizens discuss public events."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;IV&lt;/ref&gt; They are "persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Framing is selecting "some aspects of a perceived reality" to enhance their salience "in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt; Frames are to help audiences "locate, perceive, identify, and label" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;21 and to "narrow the available political alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Semetko"&gt;Semetko, Holli A. and Valenburg, Patti M. “Framing European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.” Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

News frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&amp;nbsp;– such as its organization, content, or structure&amp;nbsp;– make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Price et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;486&lt;/ref&gt; Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;

Like agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis "expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news."&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan &amp; Kosicki, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;70; emphasis in the original&lt;/ref&gt; The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt; After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.

===Impact on political media===
The Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&amp;pg=PT350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).

For example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom). It was shown that David Boothroyd - a serving Labour Party Councillor for Westminster City

The impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton (square).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bill Clinton]] was the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] to utilize the [[Internet]] in a national campaign and to appoint a Director of Email and Electronic Publishing.]]
[[E-mail]] has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Media and American Politics |last=Davis |first=Richard |author2=Owen, Diana |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-512060-4 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-Ka0nSKaFoC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=New+Media+and+American+Politics#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
The United States [[President of the United States|Presidential]] [[United States presidential election, 1996|campaign]] in 1996 between sitting-President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

With so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] United States [[Presidential election]] between [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]], the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. [[Facebook]], an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Discussion forums===
[[Blogs]] are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many [[political campaign]]s use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.&lt;ref name=Tremayne &gt;{{cite book |title=Blogging, Citizenship, and the future of media |last=Tremayne |first=Mark |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group, LLC |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-97940-4 |page=266 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a6zPnOn9i9oC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.&lt;ref name=Tremayne/&gt;

===Electronic government===
An [[e-Government]] is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netzhausen.de/internet/indage_bureaucracy_final.pdf |title= The Digital Economy: Promise &amp; Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence

==UK media phone hacking scandal==
{{Main article|News International phone hacking scandal}}
In perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1534 Column 1534]. ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We politicians have colluded for far too long with the media: we rely on them, we seek their favour, and we live and we die politically because of what they write and what they show, and sometimes that means we lack the courage or the spine to stand up when wrong has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Chris Bryant]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1540 Column 1540] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*As MPs, we depend on the media. We like to be liked by them; we need to be liked by them. We depend on the media, and that applies still more to Governments. It is an unavoidable observation that Parliament has behaved with extraordinary cowardice for many years...&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Zac Goldsmith]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1569 Column 1569] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We are faced with a scandal of expanding proportions, including hacking, allegations of interference in police investigations, and claims that payments have been made to officers. To restore faith and trust in the police and the media, we must lock up the guilty, establish a statutory inquiry, shine a cleansing light on the culture of the media and, if necessary, of the police, and implement the reforms necessary to ensure that the privacy of victims and citizens is never intruded on again. It is clear from today’s debate that this is the will of the House, and we are committed to making it happen.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Tom Brake]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0003.htm/#column_1580 Column 1580] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of  (the UK) parliament and those that form the [[UK Government]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and [[News International]] (NI [UK subsidiary of [[News Corporation]] ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.

The debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the ''[[News of the World]]'' (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘[[News of the World phone hacking affair|phone hacking affair]]’, the consequences&lt;ref&gt;The first major consequence being the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14070856 closure] of the 168 year old title of the ''News of the World'' from Sunday 10 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after [[The Walt Disney Company]]) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.&lt;ref name="lse1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson Round-Up: Over Cosy?

==Noam Chomsky reaction==
Naming (as a 'complex')  points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident [[Noam Chomsky]]. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the "two sectors" represent an "innocent fraud")&lt;ref name="galbraith"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May–June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget. That's a very fairly central theme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has blamed its existence on the [[corporate welfare|"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits"]].

Chomsky discusses the ''[[military-industrial complex]]'' (MIC)&lt;ref name="chomsky1"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Barsamian|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|work=International Socialist Review|issue=37|date=September–October 2004|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=...the military-industrial complex, as he (Eisenhower) called it, is actually the core of the modern economy. It’s not specifically military.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the "military" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.

Using the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.

Observing the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).

Chomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.

Chomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.

[[Edward S. Herman]] and Chomsky, together, advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' to accomplish this '[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|manufacturing consent]]', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news."&lt;ref name="orwell"&gt;{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.

Herman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.

Thus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.&lt;ref name="chomsky2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

The shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the ''News of the World'', when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.&lt;ref name="nowad"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon|last=Rogers|title=Top 50 News of the World advertisers - and what they spend|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/06/news-of-the-world-top-50-advertisers-spend |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Mason|title=Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14093772|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011|quote=The ''News of the World'' is closing - at least partly due to a strong campaign to make advertisers drop the title, following the latest phone hacking revelations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.

'''Polyphony''' ({{lang-ru|полифония}}) is a concept taken up by [[literary theory]], [[speech act]] theory and [[linguistics]] to refer to the simultaneity of points of view and voices within a particular narrative plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belova, King, Sliwa|first1=Olga, Ian, Martyna|title=Introduction: Polyphony and Organization Studies: Mikhail Bakhtin and Beyond|journal=Organizational Studies|date=April 1, 2008|volume=29|issue=4|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0170840608088696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Günthner|first1=Susanne|title=Polyphony and the ‘layering of voices’ in reported dialogues: An analysis of the use of prosodic devices in everyday reported speech|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|date=May 1999|volume=31|issue=5|pages=685–708|doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(98)00093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], using a metaphor based on the musical term [[polyphony]].

Bakhtin's primary example of polyphony was [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s prose. Bakhtin contended that Dostoevsky, unlike previous novelists, did not provide a 'single vision', or describe situations with a 'monological' authorial voice. Instead, he aimed for fully dramatic [[novel of ideas|novels of ideas]] in which conflicting views and characters are left to develop unevenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saul Morson, Emerson|first1=Gary, Caryl|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics|date=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, the chief characteristic of Dostoevsky's novels is "''a plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices''". His major characters are, "by the very nature of his creative design, ''not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse.''" (italics in the original)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhtin|first1=Mikhail|title=Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics|date=1984|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42148">'''[[Public]]''' '''[[rhetoric]]''' refers to discourse both within a group of people and between groups, often centering on the process by which [[individual]] or group discourse seeks membership in the larger public discourse. Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage [[agency (sociology)|agency]] on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space because the growing digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of [[tourism]] to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.

== Public rhetoric participants ==
A '''public''', not to be confused with ''the'' public, is composed of members that address each other, are addressed as a group, and also subscribe to specific ideals. [[Michael Warner]] describes a public as “being self-organized, …a relationship among strangers …[where] merely paying attention can be enough to make [one] a member.”&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|56}} Robert Asen notes that identity formation of members of a public “entails mutual recognition among members of diverse cultures." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Imagining the public sphere|last = Asen|first = Robert|date = 2002|journal = Philosophy and Rhetoric|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 35|issue = 4|page = |pages = 345–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|346}} To Warner, publics are a social space where information is exchanged and is required for the exchange of information.

=== Counterpublics ===
Within the public sphere, dominant publics exist whose discourse can subordinate other publics or exclude them from a related discourse. Counterpublics are the result of discourse and/or people feeling marginalized, ignored, inadequately voiced, or silenced within the public sphere. “Counterpublic refers to those publics that form through mutual recognition of exclusions in wider publics, set themselves against exclusionary wider publics, and resolve to overcome these exclusions,” writes Asen''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|358}} Where dominant public groups typically manufacture heteronormative public spaces and discourse, counterpublics seek to insert or reinsert voices and perspectives of and from publics. Discourse then abnormalizes or even challenges dominant public rhetoric. Warner describes the facilities of counterpublic using the [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] community:&lt;blockquote&gt;Within a gay or queer counterpublic, for example, no one is in the closet: the presumptive heterosexuality that constitutes the closet for individuals in ordinary speech is suspended. But this circulatory space, freed from heteronormative speech protocols, is itself marked by that very suspension: speech that addresses any participant as queer will circulate up to a point, at which it is certain to meet intense resistance. It might therefore circulate in special, protected venues, in limited publications. The individual struggle with stigma is transposed, as it were, to the conflict between modes of publicness. The expansive nature of public address will seek to keep moving that frontier for a queer public, to seek more and more places to circulate where people will recognize themselves in its address; but no one is likely to be unaware of the risk and conflict involved.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{rp|86–87}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Asen furthers, “Individuals do not necessarily recognize exclusions and resolve to overcome them by virtue of their location in a social order.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}} Asen maintains that claiming a counterpublic of this form can diminish counterpublic forms to particular contributors who share specific interests with other members but might not consider each other as allies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|359}}

=== Subaltern and bourgeois groups ===
Amid publics and counterpublics, prevailing ideology, discourse, and images can create a hierarchy of group members and the rhetoric thereof. The struggle for political and social power within the public sphere between publics gives rise to dominant and weaker internal publics within a public, namely [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] and [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] publics, respectively. For example, in their article “Graffiti Hurts in the United States,” Terri Moreau and Derek H. Alderman describe an anti-graffiti task force, Graffiti Hurts, advocating for the eradication of urban graffiti in public spaces. This organization funded mural projects that would serve as a deterrent for would-be graffitists. While graffiti is often considered a lesser art form compared to the classical arts such as music, canvas painting, and sculpture, the mural projects “actually work to carry out a ‘normative’ prescription of landscape. The normalization has the ability to eradicate the potential for alternative constructions of public expression. As [Kurt] Iveson observes, ‘A legal mural might have some effect in making . . . people’s culture more visible in public space, but often this is on someone else’s’ terms.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Publics and the City|last = Iveson|first = Kurt|publisher = Blackwell|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Graffiti hurts and the eradication of alternative landscape expression|last = Moreau|first = Terri|date = 2011|journal = Geographical Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1931-0846.2011.00075.x|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Alderman|first2 = Derek H.|issue = 1|volume = 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|109}}  Keith Herring argues that the dominant images of a [[gay]] counterpublic produce “clones” representing “well-built,” effeminate, white males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Keith Haring and Queer Xerography|last = Herring|first = Scott|date = 2007|journal = Public Culture|doi = 10.1215/08992363-2006-03|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 329–348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|333}} While [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|whiteness]] is idealized, racial minority imagery and representation was and remains marginalized.

A bourgeois subgroup within a public is primarily composed of “private individuals…[that] do not ‘rule’.... Instead, their ideas infiltrated the very principle on which the existing power is based.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article|last = Habermas|first = Jürgen|date = 1974|journal = New German Critique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = |pages = 49–55|editor-last = Lennox|editor-first = Sarah|editor2-last = Lennox|editor2-first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|51}} The bourgeois within a public represent a prevailing definition of the relevant publics and thereby control a greater degree of shared space for the related discourse between the larger public membership.

=== Strangers ===
'''Strangers''' are those who are not aware of their membership within a particular public. They are capable of being members of a public; however, they can also hold no opinion or in other ways pay no attention to their potential membership to a public. Strangers are normally not those who ignore their membership (which implies one is aware of being a member of a public). To Warner, without the presence of strangers in a public sphere, public discourse cannot occur because it is a requirement for public discourse to address strangers and provide them the awareness to identify themselves as an addressed public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|57}}

=== Orientation ===
Public rhetoric participants produce discourse relative to a larger conglomerate of people or publics. Within the public sphere, different publics engage their own or other publics in conversation creating discourse that affects their own and other groups through definition of public boundaries, redefining public structure, and dispersing related public ideology. For a person to produce public rhetoric, one would self-identify with a public.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;{{Rp|3}} Media, culture, and geography are the more predominant orienting processes that channel people towards and away from specific publics. Through public rhetoric, publics can recruit strangers and embed or polarize members of the same or other publics. Political propaganda and product advertisement are two concrete examples of forces that orient strangers and publics through analog and digital media. When people engage in public discourse, “describ[ing] themselves and others, they do not engage in a value-neutral and transparent process. Rather, representational processes implicate participants in (often unacknowledged) choices regarding how people should be portrayed”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|10–11}} As one begins to form judgments regarding the image of a public, of a particular ideology, or of the protocols governing inclusion and exclusion in public discourse, that person then gains membership within a relevant public, thus becoming, in part, a representation of the whole image of said public.

How one is introduced to a public varies as existing knowledge and experience can augment how one perceives a public and public rhetoric. Tony Hiss points out how places can orient and disorient civilians. In his discussion, Hiss describes public parks as having the function of “changing the way we look at things, diffusing our attention and also relaxing its intensity…”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The experience of place: A new way of looking at and dealing with our radically changing cities and countryside|last = Hiss|first = Tony|publisher = Random House, Inc|year = 1991|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|34}} The geography of the park often contrasts the image of the city in which it exists. Effective entrance design for parks encourage visitors to enter, displacing prior experience in exchange for “park experience”, in a transition that navigates the visitors smoothly to and from the park experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|42–44}} Similarly, when strangers are introduced to public discourse, orientation processes enable strangers to adopt and displace specific images of a public and evoke their membership to the new public.

== Rhetoric for public use ==
According to David J. Coogan and John M. Ackerman, “rhetoric is in the midst of discovering anew its usefulness.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[service-learning|service learning]] and [[civic engagement]] increase at colleges and universities, rhetoric begins the process of regrouping and becoming relevant in the community outside of the academy. In both the field of English and of communication, rhetoric’s reputation needs to be repaired and adapted to meet the needs of the general populace. In general, the public view of rhetoric is a negative one. It is the talk of politicians—filled with lies and manipulation. Instead, the public work of rhetoric should try to lead to social change. Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Cynthia Sheard demonstrate this belief in their work; these and other scholars believe that rhetoricians should use their tools for the good of the public. In order to make this shift in rhetoric’s reputation, rhetoric needs a new set of guidelines by which to prepare rhetoricians to participate in social action.

=== Rhetoric in praxis as social action ===
Because rhetoric and composition are so closely related, the composition classroom becomes an open space for fostering social activism through service learning and allowing students to develop a sense of agency for both their scholarship and their interactions with the public. Ellen Cushman tells readers in her article “The Rhetorician as an Agent of Social Change” that “one way to increase our participation in public discourse is to bridge the university and community through activism. Given the role rhetoricians have historically played in the politics of their communities, [Cushman believes] modern rhetoric and composition scholars can be agents of social change outside the university.”&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Through their respective institutions, Cushman argues that both young and old scholars of rhetoric and composition can use their educational expertise to connect with the public outside of the university that, as scholars, they are typically estranged from. Because universities are often situated as counterpublics within the overall public of the geographic area in which they are located, it appears that scholars often feel prohibited from approaching and participating in the outside community.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to negate this feeling of being restricted from community engagement, Cushman urges members of the rhetoric and composition community at universities to participate in service learning.

=== Reciprocity from practicing rhetoric in public spaces ===
In an attempt to bridge the gap between the university and the community, Cushman suggests ways to “empower people in our communities, establish networks of reciprocity with them, and create solidarity with them.”&lt;ref name="Cushman 1996, p. 7"/&gt; In order to invent this network of reciprocity, Cushman urges rhetoricians and students within the university to venture outside of the boundaries of the institution, foster relationships with members of the community, and to perform work that benefits the community. Hopefully the scholar perceives a [[kairos|kairotic moment]] in which they come to an understanding of the relationship between the community and public rhetoric and are then, in turn, able to write and publish on their work. In essence, “[Cushman is] asking for a deeper consideration of the civic purpose of our positions in the academy, of what we do with our knowledge, for whom, and by what means.”&lt;ref&gt;Cushman 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the reciprocity that inherently comes from performing social activism within the general community, engaging with those outside of academe allows scholars to improve the public’s general conception of rhetoric, thereby increasing the field's [[ethos]] in the eyes of the general public.

=== Reforming the public’s view of rhetoric ===
While the general populace currently views “doing rhetoric” as “menacing our fellow citizens with lies and misdirection,”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan &amp; Ackerman 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; these devices have the ability to allow rhetoricians and social activists alike to bring about social change and repair rhetoric’s reputation in the eyes of the general populace. For example, in Cynthia Sheard’s article, “The Public Value of Epideictic Rhetoric,” she discusses how [[Epideictic|epideictic rhetoric]], which has traditionally elicited a negative public opinion, can be used to foster social change. Sheard calls rhetoricians to embrace a process of “[r]econceptualizing epideictic in order to emphasize . . . [i]ts close connection to the public sphere and its visionary quality . . . ”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheard continues to explain that “epideictic discourse alters the reality in which it participates by making its vision a reality for its audience and instilling a belief that the power for realizing the vision lies with them.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 781.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sheard, this ability to alter the audience’s perception of reality, an ability that epideictic rhetoric was once criticized for, is exactly what gives this device the power to involve the general populace in social activism and persuade them to view rhetoric in a positive light instead of describing it as a manipulative device.

== Spaces ==
Spaces are the sites in which public rhetoric happens. These sites are not necessarily physical, geographically bound places, but metaphysical spaces in which discourse is shared and mediated by the members of specific publics.

=== Places vs. Spaces ===
To understand the spaces in which public rhetoric is enacted, it is important to understand the differences between “space” and “place.” In his book [[The Practice of Everyday Life]], [[Michel de Certeau]], defines places as an “instantaneous configuration of positions.” &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"&gt;Certeau 1988, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; To Certeau, places are geographically bound, locatable sites. These sites are defined by location and spatial relations to other places.

Certeau claims that places are different from spaces because places are “ultimately reducible to being there” while spaces are specified “by the actions of historical subjects.” &lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; While places could be pointed to on a map and are defined by what is physically inside of them, spaces are sites where things have happened. A space is defined by the interactions that individual agents have with it, not by its physical features. Certeau gives the examples that the place of a street becomes a space only when people walk on it and the places of texts only become spaces when people read them.&lt;ref name="Certeau 1988, p. 117"/&gt; When people engage in a discourse with a place, when they participate in public rhetoric there, it becomes a space.

=== Utopias and heterotopias ===
[[Michel Foucault]] built on Certeau’s definition of space in his essay, “Of Other Spaces: Utopias and Heterotopias,” pointing out that spaces were defined by “a set of relations that delineates sites which are irreducible to one another and absolutely not superimposable on one another.”&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"&gt;Foucault 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that these individual, specific spaces could be placed in two main types: utopias and heterotopias.

==== Utopias ====
According to Foucault, [[utopias]] are spaces with no real place which present society in its perfected form.&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt; Since these spaces are not places that exist in reality, but rather as a result of the rhetoric that surrounds them, they are described as fundamentally unreal places.

==== Heterotopias ====
[[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopias]] are real spaces that exist in every culture. Unlike Utopias, they are places that exist in physical space and can be indicated by their location. Foucault describes these heterotopias as “effectively enacted utopias in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted.”&lt;ref name="Foucault 1986, p. 24"/&gt;  These heterotopic spaces transcend a single place as their value comes from the interactions that take place inside of them, but the fact that they are universally constructed and recognized allows for them to be pointed to geographically.

==== Middle spaces ====
Middle-spaces, according to David Coogan, are spaces in which rhetors from different publics can come and have an engaging discourse. As Coogan discusses, these are both physical and ideological places in which agents from two given publics c[an] come together to engage in discourse about “the ‘codes’ to evaluate conduct, entertain political possibilities, and in other ways arrange their affairs.”&lt;ref&gt;Coogan 2010, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; These spaces are especially conducive as places for counterpublics and publics to meet to question the commonplaces or ideological statements. In enacting discourse in middle spaces, counterpublic discourse can be heard and have influence on public discourse.

== Tourism as public rhetoric ==

In discussions of public rhetoric, tourism refers both to the act of traveling to a physical location in search of a transformative experience and to the metaphorical action of traveling into the experiential world of another. Public rhetoric scholars use the language of tourism to examine individuals and communities’ relationships to each other.

=== Identity politics ===

Scholars of public rhetoric frequently invoke the language of tourism to discuss individual and group identity. This is often done to disrupt notions of individuality. [[Jürgen Habermas]], for instance, chronicles the emergence of the concept of the individual in Western society, only to demonstrate the individual’s sublimation before the regulating function of the public sphere: “With the interweaving of the public and private realm, not only do the political authorities assume certain functions in the sphere of commodity exchange and social labor, but conversely social powers now assume political functions. This leads to a kind of ‘refeudalization’ of the public sphere.”&lt;ref&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas’ concern for the political and social ramifications of individual versus public identity is one shared by other public rhetoric scholars.

=== Toxic tourism ===

Whereas the Western conception of the Subject tends to emphasize individual autonomy, scholars of public rhetoric challenge the notion that individual identity exists separately from the surrounding world. This challenge to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of identity is exemplified by the work of [[Phaedra Pezzullo]]. In ''Toxic Tourism'', Pezzullo argues that tourism as practice has the potential to help bridge the divide between Subject and Object by facilitating interaction on a multi-sensory level. Pezzullo suggests that embracing tourism’s ability to engage all of the body’s senses “may help those of us who study tourism to become more reflexive about our own culpability in privileging and, thus, perpetuating oppressive and colonial sensibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The language of interconnection and responsibility pervades public rhetoric’s concern with tourism as a process that mediates relationships between human beings.

Researchers such as Pezzullo have discussed the large extent that notions of toxicity are reflected in the ways that certain groups are marginalized. For instance, Pezzullo writes “that the ‘toxic baggage’ the nation carries exceeds the material impact of toxins and public discourses about them. It includes our cultural perceptions of our bodies and the bodies of ‘polluted’ and ‘polluting’ Others.”&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the language of toxicity is not limited to describing polluted areas or even victims of pollution. Toxicity is used to identify and rhetorically isolate segments of the population that do not conform to the Public’s normative expectations. Yet, as Pezzullo also suggests, the practice of tourism allows for travel between the Public and those citizens and groups who stand outside it. Pezzullo suggests that toxic tours, for instance, stand to allow the marginalized and often ignored Other to “look back” at the tourist who is experiencing the toxic area.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo 2007, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of becoming the Object of the Other’s gaze raises the possibility that the tourist’s perspective on the Other may be altered in the exchange, thus raising the possibility that the practice of tourism can induce transformation in the tourist.

=== Tourism and publics ===

Taken in a broad sense, the practice of tourism enables interactions that allow for the formation and maintenance of publics. Tourism as a concept does not merely connote the movement of bodies from one physical place to another; it also refers to the internalization and externalization of ideas. As Michael Warner indicates, the ability to exchange ideas is what enables the participatory creation of the public sphere and is, therefore, a source of great power: “Speaking, writing, and thinking involve us-actively and immediately-in a public, and thus in the being of the sovereign. Imagine how powerless people would feel if their commonality and participation were simply defined by pre-given frameworks, by institutions and law, as in other social contexts it is defined through kinship. . . . Such is the image of totalitarianism.”&lt;ref&gt;Warner 2002, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Examined as an exchange of ideas, the practice of tourism allows individuals to engage in discourse with other individuals, thereby creating publics.

Key to Warner and other scholars’ understanding of publics is the notion of voluntary participation. The citizen-tourist must willingly encounter the perspectives of other citizens. In this sense, public-creating tourist practices are not limited to “the pundits and wonks and reaction-shot secondary celebrities who try to perform our publicness for us . . . [, but include]  people whose place in public media is one of consuming, witnessing, griping, or gossiping rather than one of full participation, or fame.”&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"&gt;Warner 2002, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner goes on to state that, “a public can only produce a sense of belonging and activity if it is self-organized through discourse rather than through an external framework.”&lt;ref name="Warner 2002, p. 415"/&gt; Just as the tourist who travels to a different geographic area chooses to do so, a choice that invites the possibility of being transformed by the experience, the citizen-tourist must choose to engage in discourse with other citizens in order for that exchange to create and maintain a public.

==Birthplaces of public rhetoric: The street &amp; the riot==
In its most organic form, the discourse of the public sphere arises spontaneously. In his seminal work [http://unige.ch/sciences-societe/socio/files/2914/0533/6073/Habermas_1974.pdf “The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article”] Habermas discusses the bourgeois public as an instrumental development in the history of publics but recognizes the limitations of the bourgeois public for modernity: “Although the liberal model of the public sphere is still instructive today with respect to the normative claim that information be accessible to the public, it cannot be applied to the actual conditions of an industrially advanced mass democracy…”.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the modern state limits the ability of the democratic populace to truly engage in a conversation of public rhetoric. Thus, instead of self-regulating, many of the public’s demands need to be met by the state, which could not please everyone on such a large scale. When these needs are not met, the scale of the democracy requires a dramatic catalyst to bridge the distance between the citizens and bring to light the need for change.&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The most basic (albeit violent) form of public would be that of the riot, which is engendered by “competitions of interest, competitions which assume the form of violent conflicts.”&lt;ref name="Habermas 1964, p. 54"&gt;Habermas 1964, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this public is less civilized and perfect than is desirable, the spontaneity and power of riots and civil unrest—which Habermas refers to as “the street”—often affect change, as has been demonstrated throughout modern history time and time again. Without any sort of organized formation, the riot embodies the public sphere; the citizenry reacts to an issue with an outburst of the same opinion (one they may not realize they shared) and has thus created a publicly driven rhetorical discourse surrounding the issue.

The riot is organic; often considered barbaric or savage because of the raw emotions involved. Cynthia Sheard claims that it is a result of “the ways in which words fail us… all-too-common images of violence must make us wonder, indeed, whether words can make any difference in our lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheard 1996, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the riot may have devastating consequences, it is purposeful in its ability to create recognition of a problem across a nation, bridging the gaps of class and distance the issue may otherwise find insurmountable. For example, the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement is now global due to the riots following the kairotic police [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson, MO. Many of those who have never before been affected by police violence towards black males have now seen the movement “in their own backyards,” and protests have arisen across the country, while both the mainstream and social media coverage of Ferguson has enabled this issue to be prescient in the minds of many far-removed citizens.

== Digital public ==
A digital public can be considered as a few different entities. According to Patricia G. Lange, a digital space is a [[social network]], or a group of people related to each other in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Lange 2008, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Digital social networks in which knowledge is communicated and shared have been labeled “epistemopolis.”&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"&gt;Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; An epistemopolis facilitates the growth of communities in a specific space around a specific topic.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Gruber 2011, p. 155"/&gt; These digital social spaces are complicated by the possibility of anyone in the world being related to anyone else in the world in any given way at any given time; measurements or regulations or requirements for defining a specific digital space would need to be applied on an individual basis. While this isn’t necessarily up for debate in fields that study digital realms, it does present challenges for public rhetoric because it  provides a more complex, tangled conception of a public.

A digital space can take any of a variety of forms: chat rooms, social media networks, blogs, private journals, news sites, question and answer forums, professional marketing pages, online shopping sites, etc. Additionally, digital space allows for cultural interaction in a way that is not possible in [[analog signal|analog device]] spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Poster 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the internet is a social construction, designed for social interaction among various contexts (including economic, discursive, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Silver 2005, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, digital spaces can be manipulated, adapted, or even created for different, specific functions. Consider [[Wikipedia]]: “the free encyclopedia anyone can edit.” This site encourages individuals to share more information, making verified knowledge public and collaborative. Another example is Douglas Eyman's text [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=dh;c=dh;idno=13030181.0001.001;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;xc=1;g=dculture|Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice]. Eyman wrote a print and a digital version of this text and includes a statement encouraging readers to take, revise, reuse, and [[Digital rhetoric#Circulation|circulate]] his original text, which is why he made the book available for free online.

=== Public Rhetoric in the Digital Realm ===
The digital sphere presents a new set of challenges for public rhetoric. With issues of authorship, [[autonomy]], and anonymity, the field crosses back and forth constantly between private and public. Individuals can create a digital persona, an [[digital rhetoric#Avatars|avatar]], while keeping their actual identity a secret. It is relatively easy to steal content and present it as your own (leading to copyright and plagiarism issues). To a certain extent, “technology has fused with human consciousness itself,”&lt;ref&gt;Ong 1980, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a collective, shared, public memory.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people may oppose or feel threatened by advancements in technology, especially the internet. Some question personal and financial safety, a fear that may be heard as part of the argument opposing use of digital spaces. Opportunities for extended communication, in a plethora of different ways, litter the argument for development of digital spaces and tools. For example, digital [[social activism]] (also referred to as [[internet activism]] or cyberactivism) is a growing movement that uses digital spaces to spread awareness and encourage action regarding various topics.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughey &amp; Ayers 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Analog spaces tend to allow for a smaller audience than digital spaces, and therefore (typically) results in less action.

[[Digital rhetoric]] is important to consider when thinking about digital publics. Individuals create online identities, influencing how a digital audience can be addressed. This in turn influences how the author uses [[Digital rhetoric#Canons|the rhetorical canons]] in their composition.

== The photographic image as an icon ==
Photographic images can function in public rhetoric as [[Cultural icon|icons]] of U.S. public culture. According to [[Robert Hariman]] and [[John Lucaites|John Louis Lucaites]] in ''No Caption Needed: Iconic Photographs, Public Culture, and Liberal Democracy'', iconic images “work in several registers of ritual and response.”&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Public interpretations and influences of iconic photographic images manifest themselves as visual representations, or delivery of rhetoric. How these images function in public depends on the features of the specific image, the motivation for the image, and the responses from the public sphere.

=== What makes an icon an icon? ===
While multiple interpretations of photographic images as icons are discussed in conversations of public rhetoric, establishing what makes an icon an icon is important in order to identify and further analyze icons’ functions. Hariman and Lucaites describe the seven characteristics of an icon as follows:

# is easily recognized by many people of varied backgrounds;
# is an object of veneration and other complex emotional responses;
# is reproduced widely and placed prominently in both public and private settings;
# is used to orient the individual [viewer] within a context of collective identity, obligation, and power;
# represents large swaths of historical experience and acquires its own history of appropriation and commentary;
# stands above the welter of news, debates, decisions, and investigations; and/or
# bears witness to something that exceeds words.&lt;ref name="Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 1"/&gt;
If a photographic image holds one or more of the above-mentioned characteristics, it is considered an icon and fulfills several important functions in public rhetoric.

=== Functions of photographic icons in  public life ===
As a version of public rhetoric, iconic images serve to compose meaning and persuade a public audience to respond in some way. According to Hariman and Lucaites, “each image presents a pattern of motivation that can make some responses more likely than others.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; An iconic image [[semiotically]] promotes an interpretation by its audience that is by no means incumbent on the specific image, but likely will create a realm of similar meanings more frequently than others. Five vectors of influence are identified for iconic photographs: “reproducing [[ideology]], communicating social knowledge, shaping collective [[Memoria|memory]], modeling citizenship, and providing figural resources for communicative action.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman and Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproducing ideology ====
Iconic images have the capability of representing [[ideology]], which Hariman and Lucaites define as “a set of beliefs that presents a social order as if it were a natural order, that presents asymmetrical relationships as if they were mutually beneficial, and that makes authority appear self-evident.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph has the power to create such public meaning that can manipulate order, relationships, and authority as part of reproducing ideology.

==== Communicating social knowledge ====
Because icons are distinctively public visual images, they “recast social knowledge with regard to the distinctive concerns and roles of public life.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; By tapping into the knowledge of the public to which they are being presented, icons effectively persuade members of a society and their social interactions, as any successful rhetoric does. Photographs can communicate social knowledge because they are accepted as representations of social performance.

==== Shaping collective memory ====
Photographic icons can negotiate collective memory as part of the social knowledge it communicates. An icon can shape public understanding of specific events and contexts at the kairotic time of their occurrence and thereafter. Thus, society as a whole acts as the audience of the rhetorical message sent about the time the photograph was taken. Hariman and Lucaites contend, “the more collective memory is constructed through the visual media, the more likely it is that the iconic photos will be used to mark, frame, and otherwise set the tone for later generations’ understanding of public life”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; in the specific time period.

==== Modeling citizenship ====
Members of the public interpreting iconic images can themselves be shaped by the messages sent by the icons, as can their [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] relationships with each other. When viewing icons that portray U.S. citizens, the audience sees themselves in those citizens and emulates their portrayal of society. Iconic images essentially “display the public to themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Providing figural resources for communicative action ====
Since society can be considered “abstract” in terms of relationships between citizens, photographs serve to communicate such ambiguous citizenship and supply models for how to be a “good citizen.” Hariman and Lucaites explain that “an iconic photograph can continue to shape public understanding and action long after the event has passed or the crisis has been resolved pragmatically.”&lt;ref&gt;Hariman &amp; Lucaites 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The collective memory formed by iconic photographs inspire action to perform as a moral citizen and motivate public response.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7539">A '''pyrotechnician''' is a person who is responsible for the safe storage, handling, and functioning of [[pyrotechnics]] and pyrotechnic devices. Although the term is generally used in reference to individuals who operate pyrotechnics in the entertainment industry, it can include all individuals who regularly handle explosives. However, individuals who handle more powerful materials for commercial, demolition, or military applications are generally referred to as explosive technicians.

==Certification==
It is becoming more common in different countries and regions for individuals involved with the storage, handling and operation of pyrotechnics to have some form of license or certification. The specific requirements for certification, along with any restrictions or prohibitions, however, can vary wildly from one jurisdiction to the next. Most jurisdictions do require some type of minimum professional fireworks training before being allowed to apply for certification.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received approved training, including working under the direct supervision of a licensed pyrotechnician, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians are required to maintain a log of their experience and to submit this log annually during the license renewal process.

There is a push to form a recreational pyrotechnic association, ARPA (Australian Recreational Pyrotechnic Association) that would benefit those who do not wish to shoot professional displays or acquire a professional license and would rather discharge smaller consumer fireworks that do not pose a higher risk as the professional devices. The association still has guidelines and requirements that form part of a safety strategy, but less training and expenses would be the benefit of the association as individuals do not need the training that the professional devices require.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification, administered by the Explosives Regulatory Division of [[Natural Resources Canada]]. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received government training, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians, of any classification or certification, are required to maintain a log of their experience.   

Certification for the use of proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics in Canada is separate from certification for display [[fireworks]], and different government training and certification must be obtained.

The available licenses for the use of proximate pyrotechnics are sub-divided into one of 6 categories.

====Pyrotechnician====
The Pyrotechnician classification is the primary classification in Canada. Individuals may use a restricted list of pyrotechnics individually, but may fabricate, handle, and set up a broader list of pyrotechnics typically prohibited to the pyrotechnician under the direct supervision of a higher-licensed individual. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Senior Pyrotechnician certification. Certification is valid for five years.

====Senior Pyrotechnician====
The Senior Pyrotechnician classification is the intermediate classification in Canada. Individuals can supervise other pyrotechnicians and use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics typically prohibited while under the direct supervision of a Special Effects Technician. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Special Effects Technician certification. Certification is valid for five years.

====Special Effects Technician====
The Special Effects Technician classification is the most advanced classification in Canada. Individuals may use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics device typically prohibited. A Special Effects Technician may also apply for special certification to use restricted material, such as detonating cord and exploding bolts. Certification is valid for five years.

====Authorities Having Jurisdiction====
Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) are individuals certified by the Explosive Regulatory Division to inspect and approve pyrotechnic events, including members of agencies associated with pyrotechnics such as fire departments and police forces. Unlike other certification classes, Authorities Having Jurisdiction are not required to pay fees to attend training sessions.

====Out-of-Country Technicians====
Pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada participating in the production of a pyrotechnics special effects event in Canada are required to obtain a Visitor Card at either a Pyrotechnician or Special Effects Technician equivalent level. 
A certified Canadian technician of the applicable class must also be employed for the production. Visitor Cards are valid for one year.

Alternately, pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada may apply for Canadian certification, provided they meet the minimum requirements and attend the Explosive Regulatory Division certification training.

===United States===
There is no national certification or licensing requirements for pyrotechnicians in the United States, however, many individual states implement their own certification or licensing programs. Not all states have [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] agreements in regards to honouring another state's certification, so it is not uncommon for pyrotechnicians to have certifications from multiple states. Certain states require certification to store, handle and operate [[fireworks]] but not proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics; other states use the same certification for all pyrotechnics.

Professional pyrotechnic companies typically have licenses issued by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] with regard to manufacturer and distribution of pyrotechnic materials. A special category of driver's license is required for anyone who wishes to transport pyrotechnic materials by vehicle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36797">'''Representation''' is the use of signs that stand in for and take the place of something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; It is through representation that people organize the world and reality through the act of naming its elements.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt; Signs are arranged in order to form [[semantics|semantic]] constructions and express relations.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt; 
[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of [[Aristotle]], Greek philosopher]]
For many philosophers, both ancient and modern, man is regarded as the "representational animal" or ''[[animal symbolicum]]'', the creature whose distinct character is the creation and the manipulation of signs – things that "stand for" or "take the place of" something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;

Representation has been associated with [[aesthetics]] (art) and [[semiotics]] (signs). Mitchell says "representation is an extremely elastic notion, which extends all the way from a stone representing a man to [[Ulysses (novel)|a novel]] representing the day in the life of several Dubliners".&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 13--&gt;
 
The term 'representation' carries a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]], 'representation' is commonly defined in three ways. 
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time; to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies.&lt;ref name=Stadler2005/&gt;

==Defining representation==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|''Reproduction of the [[Mona Lisa]]'']]
To represent is "to bring to mind by description," also "to symbolize, to be the embodiment of;" from O.Fr. representer (12c.), from L. repraesentare, from re-, intensive prefix, + praesentare "to present," lit. "to place before".

A representation is a type of recording in which the sensory information about a physical [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is described in a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. The degree to which an artistic representation ''resembles'' the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the [[Mona Lisa]] and a child's crayon drawing of [[Lisa del Giocondo]] would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.

==History==
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Greek theatrical masks depicted in [[Hadrian]]s Villa mosaic'']]
Since ancient times representation has played a central role in understanding literature, aesthetics and semiotics. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] are key figures in early literary theory who considered literature as simply one form of representation.&lt;ref name=Childers1995&gt;Childers J (ed.), ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'', Columbia University Press, New York, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle for instance, considered each mode of representation, verbal, visual or musical, as being natural to human beings.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002&gt;&lt;Vukcevich, M 2002, "Representation", The University of Chicago, viewed 7 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, what distinguishes humans from other animals is their ability to create and manipulate signs.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990&gt;Mitchell, W, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle deemed mimesis as natural to man, therefore considered representations as necessary for people's learning and being in the world.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002/&gt; Plato, in contrast, looked upon representation with more caution. He recognised that literature is a representation of life, yet also believed that representations create worlds of illusion leading one away from the [[The Real|"real things"]].&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.), ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.  {{ISBN|978-0761954323}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, representation, like contemporary media, intervenes between the viewer and the real, creating illusions that lead one away from "real things". Plato believed that representation needs therefore, to be controlled and monitored due to the possible dangers resulting in its ability to foster antisocial emotions or encourage the imitation of evil.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Aristotle went on to say it was a definitively human activity.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;
From childhood man has an instinct for representation, and in this respect man differs from the other animals that he is far more imitative and learns his first lessons though imitating things.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;
Aristotle discusses representation in three ways—
#'''The object:''' The symbol being represented.
#'''Manner:''' The way the symbol is represented.
#'''Means:''' The material that is used to represent it.
The '''means''' of literary representation is [[language]]. An important part of representation is the relationship between what the material and what it represents. The questions arising from this are, "A stone may represent a man but how? And by what and by what agreement, does this understanding of the representation occur?"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;

One apprehends reality only through representations of reality, through texts, discourses, images: there is no such thing as direct or unmediated access to reality. But because one can see reality only through representation it does not follow that one does not see reality at all… Reality is always more extensive and complicated than any system of representation can comprehend, and we always sense that this is so-representation never "gets" reality, which is why human history has produced so many and changing ways of trying to get it.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993&gt;Dryer 1993, cited in O’Shaughnessy &amp; Stadler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 3--&gt;

Consequently, throughout the history of human culture, people have become dissatisfied with language's ability to express reality and as a result have developed new modes of representation. It is necessary to construct new ways of seeing reality, as people only know reality through representation.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993/&gt; From this arises the contrasting and alternate theories and representational modes of abstraction, realism and modernism, to name a few.

==Contemporary ideas about representation==
It is from Plato’s caution that in the modern era many are aware of political and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In [[motion picture rating system]]s, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on a life of their own once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Consequently, for each of the above definitions there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function in the context of a body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

For instance objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; Viewing representation in such a way focuses on understanding how language and systems of knowledge production work to create and circulate meanings. Representation is simply the process in which such meanings are constructed.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; In much the same way as the post-structuralists, this approach to representation considers it as something larger than any one single representation. A similar perspective is viewing representation as part of a larger field, as Mitchell, saying, "…representation (in memory, in verbal descriptions, in images) not only 'mediates' our knowledge (of slavery and of many other things), but obstructs, fragments, and negates that knowledge"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1994&gt;Mitchell, W, ''Picture Theory'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p188--&gt; and proposes a move away from the perspective that representations are merely "objects representing", towards a focus on the relationships and processes through which representations are produced, valued, viewed and exchanged.

==Peirce and representation==
[[Image:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) was an innovative and accomplished logician, mathematician, and scientist, and founded [[pragmatism|philosophical pragmatism]]. Peirce's central ideas were focused on [[logic]] and representation.

===Semiotics and logic===
Peirce distinguished philosophical logic as logic ''per se'' from mathematics of logic. He regarded logic (''per se'') as part of philosophy, as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;On his classifications, see Peirce, C.S. (1903), CP 1.180–202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' 2:372–3. For the relevant quotes, see "Philosophy" and "Logic" at ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]'', Bergman and Paavola, editors, U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the art of devising methods of research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', vol. 2, no. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1892, ''Google Book Search'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:214–214; ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 4:378–382.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, more generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1878) "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–615, 1878, reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 645–668, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 3:276–290, and ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:142–154. "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce held that logic is formal semiotic,&lt;ref name=L75&gt;Peirce, C. S. (written 1902), "MS L75: Logic, Regarded As Semeiotic (The Carnegie application of 1902): Version 1: An Integrated Reconstruction", Joseph Ransdell, ed., ''Arisbe'', see [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 Memoir 12].&lt;/ref&gt; the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraph 448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations, interpretable by mind or ''quasi-mind'' (whatever works like a mind despite perhaps not actually being one);&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-Mind]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, eds., University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus here is on sign action in general, not psychology, linguistics, or social studies).

He argued that, since all thought takes time, "all thought is in signs"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1868), "Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted (''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraphs 213–263, the quote is from paragraph 253).&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes ("[[semiosis]]") and that the three irreducible elements of semiosis are (1) the ''sign'' (or [[wiktionary:representamen|representamen]]), (2) the (semiotic) ''object'', the sign's subject matter, which the sign represents and which can be anything thinkable&amp;mdash;quality, brute fact, or law&amp;mdash;and even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet]]), and (3) the ''interpretant'' (or interpretant sign), which is the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect that is a further sign, for example, a translation.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of semiosis, sign, representamen, object, interpretant, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign because it is at least potentially interpretable. A sign depends on its object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) interpretation, forming an interpretant which, in turn, depends on the sign and on the object ''as the sign depends on the object'' and is thus a further sign, enabling and determining still further interpretation, further interpretants. That essentially triadic process is logically structured to perpetuate itself and is what defines sign, object, and interpretant.

An object either (1) is ''immediate'' to a sign, and that is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a ''dynamic'' object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's [[universe of discourse]], the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) ''immediate'' to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) ''dyanamic'', an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) ''final'' or ''normal'', a question's true settlement, which ''would'' be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce said that, in order to know to what a sign refers, the mind needs some sort of experience of the sign's object, experience outside, and collateral to, the given sign or sign system. In that context he spoke of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref&gt;Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Professor Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here]. Also see pp. 404–409 in "Pragmatism" by Peirce in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, art work can exploit both the richness and the limits of the audience's experience; a novelist, in disguising a ''[[roman à clef]]'', counts on the typical reader's lack of personal experience with the actual individual people portrayed. Then the reader refers the signs and interpretants in a general way to an object or objects of the kind that is represented (intentionally or otherwise) by the novel. In all cases, the object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, collateral experience in which the object is newly found or from which it is recalled, even if it is experience with an object of imagination as called into being by the sign, as can happen not only in fiction but in theories and mathematics, all of which can involve mental experimentation with the object under specifiable rules and constraints. Through collateral experience even a sign that consists in a chance semblance of an absent object is determined by that object.

Peirce held that logic has three main parts:
# '''Speculative grammar''',&lt;ref name=spec&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/grammarspec.html Grammar: Speculative]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on meaningfulness, conditions for meaning. Study of significatory elements and combinations.
# '''Logical critic''',&lt;ref name=critic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/critic.html Critic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various distinct modes.
# '''Speculative rhetoric''', or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=methodeutic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/methodeutic.html Methodeutic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

1. '''Speculative Grammar'''. By this, Peirce means discovering relations among questions of how signs can be meaningful and of what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others. Within this broad area, Peirce developed three interlocked universal [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomies]] of signs, depending respectively on (1) the sign itself, (2) how the sign stands for its object, and (3) how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Each trichotomy is divided according to the phenomenological category involved: ''Firstness'' (quality of feeling, essentially monadic), ''secondness'' (reaction or resistance, essentially dyadic), or ''thirdness'' (representation or mediation, essentially triadic).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/categories.html Categories, Cenopythagorean Categories]", ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#I. Qualisign.2C sinsign.2C legisign|Qualisigns, sinsigns, and legisigns]]. Every sign is either (qualisign) a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] or possibility, or (sinsign) an actual individual thing, fact, event, state, etc., or (legisign) a norm, habit, rule, law.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon.2C index.2C symbol|Icons, indices, and symbols]]. Every sign refers either (icon) through similarity to its object, or (index) through factual connection to its object, or (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#III. Rheme.2C dicisign.2C argument|Rhemes, dicisigns, and arguments]]. Every sign is interpreted either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object in respect of quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}} 
Some (not all) sign classes from different trichotomies intersect each other. For example, a qualisign is always an icon, and is never an index or a symbol. He held that there were only ten classes of signs logically definable through those three universal trichotomies.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 254–263, reprinted in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSjXRIbxAMC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115]–118, and in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 294–296.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that there were further such universal trichotomies as well. Also, some signs need other signs in order to be embodied. For example, a legisign (also called a type), such as the word "the," needs to be embodied in a sinsign (also called a token), for example an individual instance of the word "the", in order to be expressed. Another form of combination is attachment or incorporation: an index may be attached to, or incorporated by, an icon or a symbol.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;On image, diagram, and metaphor, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypoicon.html Hypoicon]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations.

2. '''Logical critic''' or Logic Proper. That is how Peirce refers to logic in the everyday sense. Its main objective, for Peirce, is to classify arguments and determine the validity and force of each kind.&lt;ref name=critic/&gt; He sees [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|three main modes]]: [[Abductive reasoning|abductive inference]] (guessing, inference to a hypothetical explanation); [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. A work of art may embody an inference process and be an argument without being an explicit argumentation. That is the difference, for example, between most of ''[[War and Peace]]'' and its final section.

3. '''Speculative rhetoric''' or methodeutic. For Peirce this is the theory of effective use of signs in investigations, expositions, and applications of truth. Here Peirce coincides with Morris’s notion of pragmatics, in his interpretation of this term. He also called it "methodeutic", in that it is the analysis of the methods used in inquiry.&lt;ref name=methodeutic/&gt;

===Using signs and objects===
Peirce concluded that there are three ways in which signs represent objects. They underlie his most widely known trichotomy of signs:
* Icon
* Index
* Symbol&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of icon, index, symbol, and related terms, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Icon
This term refers to signs that represent by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though they can also be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode of apprehension such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) bristling with particulars.

;Index
Peirce explains that an index is a sign that compels attention through a connection of fact, often through cause and effect. For example, if we see smoke we conclude that it is the effect of a cause – fire. It is an index if the connection is factual regardless of resemblance or interpretation. Peirce usually considered personal names and demonstratives such as the word "this" to be indices, for although as words they depend on interpretation, they are indices in depending on the requisite factual relation to their individual objects. A personal name has an actual historical connection, often recorded on a birth certificate, to its named object; the word "this" is like the pointing of a finger.

;Symbol
Peirce treats symbols as habits or norms of reference and meaning. Symbols can be natural, cultural, or abstract and logical. They depend as signs on how they ''will'' be interpreted, and lack or have lost dependence on resemblance and actual, indexical connection to their represented objects, though the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of its represented object. Symbols are instantiated by specialized indexical sinsigns. A proposition, considered apart from its expression in a particular language, is already a symbol, but many symbols draw from what is socially accepted and culturally agreed upon. Conventional symbols such as "horse" and ''&lt;span lang=es&gt;caballo&lt;/span&gt;'', which prescribe qualities of sound or appearance for their instances (for example, individual instances of the word "horse" on the page) are based on what amounts to arbitrary stipulation.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt; Such a symbol uses what is already known and accepted within our society to give meaning. This can be both in spoken and written language.

For example, we can call a large metal object with four wheels, four doors, an engine and seats a "car" because such a term is agreed upon within our culture and it allows us to communicate.  In much the same way, as a society with a common set of understandings regarding language and signs, we can also write the word "car" and in the context of Australia and other English speaking nations, know what it symbolises and is trying to represent.&lt;ref name=Dupriez1991&gt;Dupriez, B, ''A Dictionary of Literary Devices'', University of Toronto Press, Canada, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saussure and representation==
[[Image:Ferdinand de Saussure by Jullien.png|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]
Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) played a major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=Culler1976&gt;Culler, J 1976, ''Saussure'', Fontana Modern Masters, Britain, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies.&lt;ref name=Ryder2004&gt;Ryder, M, ''Semiotics: Language and Culture'', 2004 viewed 6 April 2006 see link below&lt;/ref&gt; Although semiotics is often used in the form of [[textual analysis]] it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.

The process of representation is characterised by using signs that we recall mentally or phonetically to comprehend the world.&lt;ref name=Klarer1998&gt;Klarer, M, ''An Introduction to Literary Studies'', Routledge, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure says before a human can use the word "tree" she or he has to envision the mental concept of a tree.

Two things are fundamental to the study of signs:&lt;ref name=Barry2002&gt;Barry, P, ''Beginning Theory: an Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory'', Manchester University Press, Great Britain, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The '''signified:''' a mental concept, and
#The '''signifier:''' the verbal manifestation, the sequence of letters or sounds, the linguistic realisation.
The signifier is the word or sound; the signified is the representation.
 
Saussure points out that signs:
*Are '''arbitrary:''' There is no link between the signifier and the signified
*Are '''relational:''' We understand we take on meaning in relation to other words. Such as we understand "up" in relation to "down" or a dog in relation to other animals, such as a cat.
*'''constitute our world''' – "You cannot get outside of language. We exist inside a system of signs".&lt;ref name=Barry2002/&gt;

Saussure suggests that the meaning of a sign is arbitrary, in effect; there is no link between the signifier and the signified.&lt;ref name=Holdcroft1991&gt;Holdcroft 1991 no details&lt;/ref&gt; The signifier is the word or the sound of the word and the signified is the representation of the word or sound. For example, when referring to the term "sister" (signifier) a person from an English speaking country such as Australia, may associate that term as representing someone in their family who is female and born to the same parents (signified). An [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal Australian]] may associate the term "sister" to represent a close friend that they have a bond with. This means that the representation of a signifier depends completely upon a person’s cultural, linguistic and social background. Saussure argues that if words or sounds were simply labels for existing things in the world, translation from one language or culture to another would be easy, it is the fact that this can be extremely difficult that suggests that words trigger a representation of an object or thought depending on the person that is representing the signifier.&lt;ref name=Chandler2001&gt;Chandler, D, ''Semiotics for Beginners: Modality and representation'', viewed 8 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The signified triggered from the representation of a signifier in one particular language do not necessarily represent the same signified in another language. Even within one particular language many words refer to the same thing but represent different people's interpretations of it. A person may refer to a particular place as their "work" whereas someone else represents the same signifier as their "favorite restaurant".  This can also be subject to historical changes in both the signifier and the way objects are signified.

Saussure claims that an imperative function of all written languages and alphabetic systems is to "represent" spoken language.&lt;ref name=Arnason2006&gt;Arnason, D, Reference material, 2006, viewed 12 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most languages do not have writing systems that represent the [[Phoneme|phonemic sounds]] they make. For example, in English the written letter "a" represents different phonetic sounds depending on which word it is written in. The letter "a" has a different sound in the word in each of the following words, "apple", "gate", "margarine" and "beat", therefore, how is a person unaware of the phonemic sounds, able to pronounce the word properly by simply looking at alphabetic spelling. The way the word is represented on paper is not always the way the word would be represented phonetically. This leads to common misrepresentations of the phonemic sounds of speech and suggests that the [[writing system]] does not properly represent the true nature of the pronunciation of words.

&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Oral Interpretation|last = Bahn|first = Eugene|publisher = Burgess Publishing Co.|year = 1970|isbn = |location = Minneapolis|pages = 56|last2 = Bahn|first2 = Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''{{lang|ags|scop}}''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɒ|p}} or {{IPAc-en|s|k|ɒ|p}}&lt;ref&gt;http://oed.com/view/Entry/172966?redirectedFrom=scop# "Pronunciation:  /ʃɒp/ /skɒp/" Retrieved 06FEB2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a poet as represented in [[Old English literature#Poetry|Old English poetry]]. The scop is the Old English counterpart of the [[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|[[skald]]}}'', with the important difference that "skald" was applied to historical persons, and scop is used, for the most part, to designate oral poets ''within'' Old English literature. Very little is known about the mythical scop, and its historical existence is questioned by some scholars.

== Functions ==
The scop, like the similar [[gleeman]], was a reciter of poetry. The scop, however, was typically attached to a court on a relatively permanent basis. There, he most likely received rich gifts for his performances. The performances often featured the recitation of recognisable texts such as the "old pagan legends of the Germanic tribes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the scop's duties also included ''composing'' his own poetry in different situations, the eulogizing of his master. While some scops moved from court to court, they were (generally speaking) less nomadic than the gleemen and had positions of greater security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Etymology ==

Old English ''{{lang|ags|scop}}'' and its cognate [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|scoph, scopf, scof}}'' (glossing ''{{lang|la|poeta}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[vates]]}}''; also ''{{lang|la|poema}}'') may be related to the verb ''scapan'' "to create, form" (Old Norse ''skapa'', Old High German ''scaffan''; [[Modern English]] ''[[:wikt:shape|shape]]''), from Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|skapiz}}'' "form, order" (from a PIE ''{{PIE|*(s)kep-}}'' "cut, hack"), perfectly parallel to the notion of craftsmanship expressed by the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  ''{{lang|grc-Latn|poetēs}}'' itself;&lt;ref&gt;suggested e.g. by Alexander 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Köbler (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;220) suggests that the West Germanic word may indeed be a [[calque]] of Latin ''{{lang|la|poeta}}''.

== ''Scop'', ''scopf'', and relationship to ''scold''==
While ''{{lang|non|skop}}'' became English ''[[:wikt:scoff|scoff]]'', the Old Norse ''{{lang|non|skald}}'' lives on in a [[Modern English]] word of a similarly deprecating meaning, ''[[:wikt:scold|scold]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} There is a homonymous Old High German ''{{lang|goh|scopf}}'' meaning "abuse, derision" ([[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|skop}}'', meaning "mocking, scolding", whence ''scoff''), a third meaning "tuft of hair", and yet another meaning "barn" (cognate to English ''shop''). They may all derive from a Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|skupa}}''.

The association with jesting or mocking was, however, strong in Old High German. There was a ''{{lang|goh|skopfari}}'' glossing both ''{{lang|la|poeta}}'' and ''{{lang|la|comicus}}'' and a ''{{lang|goh|skopfliod}}'' glossing ''{{lang|la|canticum rusticum et ineptum}}'' and ''{{lang|la|psalmus plebeius}}''. ''{{lang|goh|Skopfsang}}'', on the other hand, is of a higher register, glossing ''{{lang|la|poema, poesis, tragoedia}}''. The words involving jesting are derived from another root, Proto-Indo-European ''*skeub-'' "push, thrust", related to English ''shove, shuffle'', and the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] favours association of ''{{lang|ags|scop}}'' with that root. The question cannot be decided formally since the Proto-Germanic forms coincided in [[Indo-European ablaut|zero grade]], and by the time of the surviving sources (from the late 8th century), the association with both roots may have influenced the word for several centuries.

It is characteristic of the Germanic tradition of poetry that the sacred or heroic cannot be separated from the ecstatic or drunken state and so crude jesting (compare the ''[[Lokasenna]]'', where the poet humorously depicts the gods themselves as quarrelsome and malicious), qualities summed up in the concept of ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|wōþuz}}'', the namegiving attribute of the god of poetry, ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|[[Wōdanaz]]}}''.

== Mystery of Anglo-Saxon scop ==
Professor of Literature at University of California San Diego, [[Seth Lerer]] suggests, "What we have come to think of as the inherently 'oral' quality of Old English Poetry... [may] be a literary fiction of its own."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Literacy and Power in Anglo-Saxon Literature|last = Lerer|first = Seth|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Lincoln|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early English scholars have different opinions on whether or not the Anglo-Saxon oral poet ever really existed. Much of the poetry that survives does have an oral quality to it, but some scholars argue that it is a trait carried over from an earlier Germanic period. If, as some critics believe, the idea of the Anglo-Saxon oral poet is based on the Old Norse [[Skald]], it can be seen as a link to the heroic past of the Germanic peoples. There is no proof that the "scop" existed, and it could be a literary device allowing poetry to give an impression of orality and performance. This poet figure recurs throughout the literature of the period, whether real or not. Examples are the poems [[Widsith]] and [[Deor]], in the [[Exeter Book]], which draw on the idea of the mead-hall poet of the heroic age and, along with the anonymous heroic poem, [[Beowulf]] express some of the strongest poetic connections to oral culture in the literature of the period.

{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' syndicated comic strips were printed daily in newspapers from 1928 to 1970. They were originally created by John Hix. ''Strange as It Seems'' was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources.

It was syndicated domestically by [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] and internationally by [[United Press International]]. At its peak the strip was printed in 1,300 newspapers. The cartoons competed in newspapers with ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' cartoons. Other similar strips at the time included Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'' and ''[[It Happened in Canada]]'' by Gordon Johnston.

By 1953, the strip's syndication was down to 175 newspapers. The demise of multiple newspapers in cities and the changing taste of readers led to the strip ending in 1970.

The cartoon strip was written and drawn by John Hix from 1928 until his health began to deteriorate in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby began drawing the strip, although Hix continued to oversee and approve all content.

John Hix died of [[myocarditis]] on June 6, 1944 (which was also [[D-Day]]). His brother, Ernest Hix, took over producing the feature. The cartoons were drawn by Dick Kirby from 1944 to 1946, then by Doug Heyes from 1946 to 1948. After Ernest Hix's death in the crash of a private plane on September 18, 1948, in Los Angeles, the writing of the strip was taken over by his wife Elsie Huber Hix. Ms. Hix had two young children at the time, Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Dixie Ann Hix. Dick Kirby returned to draw the strip from 1948 until 1949, then George Jahns took over and continued as the feature's artist until 1970 when the strip was discontinued. Ms. Hix continued to write the stories for the comics until 1963, when she turned the work over to her son, Ernest Hix, Jr. He wrote and produced the strip with his wife Phyllis until 1970 when the feature went out of syndication.

==Radio show==
''Strange as It Seems'' was a radio program of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, based on the daily syndicated newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. ''Strange as It Seems'' began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee Coast]] radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer [[daylight saving time]]). The sponsor was [[Ex‐Lax]]. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the ''Strange as It Seems'' stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by [[Gayne Whitman]], produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts from 1930–1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as "butterflies smell with their feet" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16" [[33 RPM]] records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program was picked up as a 30-minute network program on the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] from August 17, 1939 to December 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight saving time). There were 72 broadcasts of these 1⁄2 hour broadcasts. The sponsor was [[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive Shave Cream]] and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. ''Stranger Than Fiction'' was the successor to the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction #2 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified.

===Gayne Whitman (announcer 1935–1939)===
Alfred Vosburgh was born March 19, 1890 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He first used the stage name of Alfred Whitman when he began acting in silent films in 1917. He later used the stage name [[Gayne Whitman]], beginning in 1925. He was an American radio and film actor. On radio, he played the title role in Chandu the Magician and was an announcer on other programs. He appeared in 213 films between 1904 and 1957. His wife was the former Estelle Allen. Whitman died on August 31, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA of a heart attack.

===Gordon "Felix" Mills (musical director (1935–1939)===
Gordon 'Felix' Mills was born on July 28, 1901 in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He was a highly successful composer-arranger-conductor during the [[Golden Age of Radio]] in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the musical director for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]'', a Disney radio show of the 1930s. Mills created a "gadget band" with wild instruments for Donald Duck to direct on some episodes.

He was also the musical director for CBS Radio's ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]'' from 1937 to 1947. Choosing to retire rather than fire a few band members during the Red Inquisition, he built a home in Morro Bay, California to pursue his favorite hobbies, sailing and slide photography. Mills died on April 5, 1987 at Morro Bay, California.

===Cyril Armbrister (producer and director 1935–1939)===
Cyril Edward Armbrister was born on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]] on August 24, 1896. His ancestors had been British loyalists during the Revolutionary War and immigrated to the Bahamas in the late 1700s. His father, William Armbrister, married for a second time at the age of 76 to Eugenie Bode and Cyril was born of this marriage. His father died when Cyril was 12 and he and his mother moved to Canada. Cyril was educated in England and was a captain in the Canadian Militia during World War I. He later moved to Hollywood and became a director. He directed ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', [[Terry and the Pirates (radio serial)|''Terry and the Pirates'']], and [[Land of the Lost (radio)|''Land of the Lost'']], among other radio programs. He married the actress Frances Fintel and they split their time between California and the family plantation on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]]. Cyril's son Tony developed the family plantation into the resort, Fernandez Bay. Cyril died on September 18, 1966 in Nassau, Bahamas.

===Alois Havrilla (announcer 1939‐1940)===
Alois Havrilla was born June 7, 1891 in Presov, Slovakia. He arrived in the United States as a small child, speaking no English. He worked hard to perfect his English. He began his radio career as a baritone singer. In 1921, he recorded, "Tancuj, Tancuj," a well-known Slovak folk song. He then worked as an announcer on the ''[[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive]] Hour'' on [[NBC]] from 1927 to 1931. He also worked as an announcer on several other radio programs, including ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in 1934–1935 and the [[Paul Whiteman]] radio program. In 1935, he received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], the prestigious Medal for Good Diction and was named as the country's best radio announcer. He also worked as a narrator for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]] Pictorial and Pathe Motion Picture Studios. Havrilla worked at a number of New York-area radio stations as a news commentator, announcer, narrator, and host of musical programs. He died on December 7, 1952 in Englewood, New Jersey.

==Film shorts==
[[Warner Brothers]] released a series of short films beginning in May 1930 based on Robert Ripley's ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'' cartoon series. [[Universal Studios]] responded by signing John Hix to a contract to create short films based on his cartoon strip ''Strange as It Seems''. There were 39 short subjects released between August 22, 1930 and May 5, 1934, coming out on average about once per month. The films were produced by [[Jerry Fairbanks]] &amp; Manny Nathan, scripted by John Hix and narrated by [[Gayne Whitman]].&lt;ref name="SAIS1"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183823/ Strange as It Seems #1 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The first 21 released in 1930 were produced in Multicolor. Beginning in September, 1932, the remaining 17 shorts were filmed in Black &amp; White. The shorts played in over 6,000 movie theaters. When Jerry Fairbanks left Universal for rival Paramount, (starting their ''[[Popular Science|Popular Science (film)]]'' films, his ''Strange as It Seems'' series was taken over by the [[Universal Studios]] newsreel staff with Thomas Mead and Joseph O'Brien in charge and renamed ''Stranger Than Fiction''. The first of these films was released on June 28, 1934 and came out about every 2 to 3 weeks. They were also filmed in black and white and were directed by Charles E. Ford and narrated by Alois Havrilla &amp; James Wallington.&lt;ref name="STF2"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on Sept. 18, 1940, the films were directed by Henry Clay Bate and narrated by Alois Havrilla.&lt;ref name="STF70"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1556701/ Stranger Than Fiction (1940) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films was released on August 31, 1942, for a total of 110 ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films and a total of 149 short films, including the ''Stranger than Fiction'' series. Columbia Studios brought back the ''Strange as It Seems'' shorts in 1937. CBS bundled 8 of these shorts in a package to their television affiliates in 1949.

==Books==
The first ''Strange as It Seems'' book was published in 1931 and reprinted many of the cartoons from the three-year run of the newspaper feature. In December 1936, [[Eastern Color Printing]] published the ''John Hix Scrapbook''. In 1937, Eastern released a second volume.

There was also a hardback written by Elsie Huber Hix in 1945 and a follow-up paperback. Each sold over 500,000 copies. She published two more paperbacks, with the final one published in 1962.

==Comic books==
Comic books were a natural medium for these cartoons. The first of these comic books appeared in 1932. Promotional comic books were created for [[Ex-Lax]] (as a promotional giveaway on the radio program they sponsored) and [[United Airlines]] (as a handout for passengers to read on the flights). A series of comics began in 1939, with issues 2 – 9 being published.

==Exhibitions==
The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935. But by that fall, the promoters knew they needed to make changes. Areas like [[Gold Gulch]] (a replica of an 1849 Gold Rush town) and the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] were getting out of hand and generating bad publicity while the ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome, so the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was very popular. John Hix drew from his large collection of oddities for the Exhibition in the large building in the center of the Fun Zone. Then in 1939, the Hix brothers aced out Robert Ripley for an exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ripley responded with his own exhibition near the Fair and named it ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorrium''. A series of the Odditoriums would eventually be created around the world. A 1938 newspaper article described the groundbreaking of the exhibit at the World's Fair "61 Year old Shovel. Auspiciously performing groundbreaking ceremonies for the John Hix "Strange as It Seems" show at the New York World's Fairground on December 30, 1938, Grover Whalen, President of the Fair, used a shovel invented 61 years before – on April 16, 1878 – by G. B. DeForest, embodying construction principles still in use. Betty Broadbent was one of the persons at the Hix's attraction. Her body was covered almost entirely with over 450 tattoos.

==Archives==
The ''Strange as It Seems'' archives are maintained by Jeff Hix, grandnephew of John Hix and the son of Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. and are currently being digitized by HistoriVision, LLC. to be made available to the public for reference as well as for use in the ''Strange as It Seems'' productions currently published on their website and [[YouTube]] channel. According to the [http://www.strangeasitseems.com ''Strange as It Seems'' website], the archives are a "40 year treasure trove of fascinating letters and photos from the world over confirming the strange and unusual stories in sports, science, popular culture, history and nature delivered daily to its faithful readership throughout the 1930's, 40's, 50's &amp; 60's."

==Ripley vs. Hix==
Robert Ripley of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' and John Hix of ''Strange as It Seems'' competed on many media fronts in acquiring and accumulating the most original and strange facts for their projects. There was always a friendly rivalry between Ripley and Hix in their various media offerings: 
*Robert Ripley was 16 years older than John Hix so he had a head start based on his age.
*In 1918, Robert Ripley began publishing his cartoons in newspapers. John Hix began nationally syndicating his newspaper cartoons in 1928, ten years later. 
*In April 1930, Ripley aired his first radio show; Hix started his ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program in March, 1935. 
*In May 1930, Ripley released his first movie shorts through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]]. 3 months later in August 1930, Hix released his first film shorts through [[Universal Studios]]. 
*Ripley was selected for an exhibit at the [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in 1935. Hix replaced him with an exhibit at the show in 1936. 
*And in 1939, Hix scooped Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. Ripley countered by opening the first of his Ripley's Odditoriums a few blocks from the fair.

They also competed in book and comic book publishing as well.

John McCary Hix was born on June 17, 1907 in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to John Harmon Hix and Viola Ann McCary Hix. His brother Ernest Harmon Hix was born on September 13, 1902. Before World War I, the family first located to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], then [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. John Harmon Hix was a traveling salesman and moved his family to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], where their third child, a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, was born in August 1918.

At an early age, John McCary Hix had a strong urge to draw. He drew unflattering caricatures of his teachers which often got him into trouble. Eventually his cartooning paid off and his drawings appeared in the ''Nautilus'', the Greenville High School newspaper. While in school, John took a job with the ''Greenville Daily News'' as a staff artist for $5 a week.
He was also a delivery boy on his bicycle, which earned him $7 a week. His dog Pal, a shaggy black and white half-[[collie]] and half-[[Water spaniel]], followed him everywhere on his deliveries. John trained Pal to drop papers on the doorsteps of one side of street while he delivered the other. He got up every morning at 3:00 AM and was at the newspaper office by 4:00 AM. He was also the local agent for several magazines, selling them as well. 

He studied cartooning through a correspondence course, since there were no art schools nearby. When his father died on March 5, 1926 of heart failure, John was in his senior year of school. After graduation from Greenville High School in May 1926 (he has a plaque on the Greenville High School Wall of Fame),{{cn|date=November 2018}} John decided he wanted bigger things and applied to the ''[[Washington Herald]]'' newspaper as an editorial cartoonist. He got the job and moved to Washington, D.C., where he was paid $15 a week. While in Washington D.C., he attended a few classes at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design|Corcoran School of Art]]. 

He also started a daily one-column comic strip called ''Hicks by Hix'', featuring various wise-cracking [[Yokel|hick]] characters. It was syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate]].  The strip did very well and was syndicated to several newspapers. This success lead to a job with [[McClure Syndicate|McClure Newspapers]] in New York City. He illustrated a new strip called ''[[Frank Merriwell|Young Frank Merriwell]]'', written by [[Gilbert Patten]].&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2006/05/frank-merriwell-bulletin.html Stripper's Guide: A Frank Merriwell Bulletin!], May 30th, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted on March 26, 1928 and ran for 6 months (the comic strip was resurrected in July 1931 as ''Frank Merriwell's Schooldays'' and ran for three years, this time illustrated by Jack Wilhelm).&lt;ref name=Frank /&gt; He also created a strip called ''[[O. Henry]]'s Short Stories''.&lt;ref name="OHenry"&gt;[https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/09/obscurity-of-day-o-henrys-short-stories.html "Obscurity of the Day: O. Henry's Short Stories,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (October 05, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he attended a few classes at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York. His dream was to attend the [[Yale School of Art]] where several of his art school classmates were attending, but there was not the money for that so most of John's art training was learned on the job.

''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'', drawn by Robert Ripley began syndication in 1918. It contained many fantastic claims, which were not always verified. In 1927, John conceived the idea of ''Strange as It Seems'' and in December of that year, he signed a contract with The [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] in New York City, making him the nation's youngest nationally syndicated artist at only 20 years old. The cartoon was announced for syndication by McClure in February 1928 and debuted on March 28, 1928 in about 50 newspapers, the same day ''Young Frank Merriwell'' debuted. The cartoon was one panel with several illustrations of strange and unusual people, places and events. The feature required much more than just drawing as countless hours of research were required for the ideas and to verify their authenticity. Hix advertised widely that all of his claims were verified by at least three sources. He even included a notation on his cartoons, "If you doubt this, write for proof to the author." In the May 20, 1929 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, it was erroneously reported that the comic had debuted the previous week. A letter to the editor three weeks later from Harold Matson, Managing Editor of the syndicate, corrected the timing of the cartoons publication dates. ''Time'' compared Hix to Ripley with this observation: "Cartoonist Hix does not seem quite so able with his pencil as Cartoonist Ripley. Astounder Ripley, after nine years, does not seem quite so astounding as fresh Astounder Hix."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In the January 4, 1930 edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine, Hix announced that in early February 1930, ''Strange as It Seems'' would be expanded to include a full page Sunday color edition. The comic was being carried in over 80 newspapers by this time. John was now drawing a daily panel plus a Sunday color panel, a full 365 cartoons a year. As the cartoon grew in popularity and distribution spread into more papers, fans began mailing John ideas for the feature. To verify the story ideas, John would correspond with educators, scientists, civic workers and historians from around the world for photographs and documentation of authenticity. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Hix rarely traveled for his ideas, but relied on correspondence for verification and had built a repository of 50,000–60,000 usable ideas ready to be incorporated into his cartoons. The claim that drew the most requests for proof of authenticity was that [[George Washington]] was the eighth president of the United States and that he was born on February 11, not February 22. The cartoons were often accompanied by several paragraphs of explanation in an article next to the cartoon.

John Hix continued to live in Washington D.C. and is listed in the 1930 U.S. Census as living on New Hampshire Avenue, a couple of houses down from the rest of his family.
''Strange as It Seems'' became immensely popular and there were many opportunities for expanding the feature. John's brother Ernest Hix became his business manager and together they recognized the possibilities of turning the ''Strange as It Seems'' cartoons into a multi-media empire, especially after Ripley's ''[[Believe It Or Not!]]'' cartoons were transformed into live action movie shorts for [[Paramount Studios]] beginning in May 1930. 

[[Universal Studios]] offered John Hix an opportunity to create movie shorts for their studio and the first ''Strange as It Seems'' short was released on August 22, 1930. The shorts would eventually play in over 6,000 movie theaters across the country. Like the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney brothers]] a decade before them, the Hix brothers relocated their feature to [[Hollywood, California]], in 1931. In 1931, a hardback book of the cartoon stories was released. The first of many comic books with the cartoons in them appeared in 1932. In May 1932, the cartoon was in over 150 newspapers. By November 1932, the cartoons were appearing in England, China and Japan.

In the spring of 1935, John Hix turned his cartoons into a successful 15-minute radio program on the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee network]]. Beginning on Sept. 13, 1936, ''The John Hix Scrapbook'' was released as half of the syndicated Sunday Color full page cartoon. In September 1939, the radio show became a 30-minute program broadcast weekly over the CBS network for 72 weeks. Over 600 radio programs were eventually created. The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935 with an exhibit of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]''. But by the end of that year, exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome. So the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was immensely popular. In 1939, the Hix brothers outmaneuvered Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. 

In its heyday, it was reported that the ''Strange as It Seems'' comic strip was syndicated in over 1,300 newspapers. John Hix enjoyed people questioning the authenticity of his stories and continued to invite them to write for proof in each cartoon, a feature that became the centerpiece for many of his promotional newspaper articles. During World War II, John worked with the [[Office of Emergency Management]] to incorporate 70 ideas they supplied into his comics to help the war effort.

John's health began failing in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby took over the drawing of ''Strange as It Seems'', but Hix still reviewed all of the cartoons prior to publication.

On Monday evening, June 5, 1944, John Hix collapsed against a car, gashing his head in front of a hotel on Ivar Ave. He was taken to his home by his physician and died the following morning, June 6, 1944 ([[D-Day]]). The cause of death was a heart attack caused by myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle due to a viral infection). He was only 11 days shy of his 37th birthday. On June 8, 1944, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced that there would be a private service coordinated by [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries|Forest Lawn]] Mortuary. John was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA]]. His plot is in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Hall of Memory, Columbarium of Memory, Niche 19608. He had no wife or children.

===Ernest Hix===
Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. was born September 13, 1902 in Huntsville, Alabama. After he moved to Washington D.C. with his family in the 1920s, he met and married Elsie Huber in 1932. Ernest became the business manager of the "Strange as It Seems" business and helped to create a multi-media empire of cartoons, movies shorts, books, comics, radio programs and exhibitions. He relocated with his brother, mother, sister and wife to Los Angeles in the 1930s. In 1942, he shared an office with his brother, John, at 6362 Haywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA and his residence was on Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA. Ernest took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' creative business after John Hix died suddenly in 1944. Besides continuing to write the daily syndicated cartoon, Ernest revived the radio show, as a transcribed 15 minute program in 1947. The program ran until his death on September 18, 1948 in a private plane crash, shortly after take-off from the Newhall Airport north of Los Angeles.

The plane's owner, Eugene Joseff, had been warned not to take off until a fog lifted, but he took off anyway. The plane crashed and burst into flames after circling the field. Beside Ernest Hix and Eugene Joseff, there were two other persons killed in the plane crash: John M. Lacey, the pilot and Wilmer F. Pemberton, a designer.
Joseff was the maker and supplier of about 90% of the ornate jewelry used in motion pictures at the time. After his death, Hix's wife Elsie took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' work.

===Elsie Hix===
Elsie Elizabeth Huber was born Nov. 11, 1902 in Allentown, PA.  Her parents were John and Anna Lowe Huber, both born in Germany.

{{Nihongo|'''''The Familiar of Zero'''''|ゼロの使い魔|Zero no Tsukaima|lead=yes}} is a [[fantasy]] and comedy-oriented series of Japanese [[light novel]]s written by [[Noboru Yamaguchi (author)|Noboru Yamaguchi]], with illustrations by [[Eiji Usatsuka]]. [[Media Factory]] published 20 volumes between June 2004 and February 2011. The series was left unfinished due to the author's death on April 4, 2013,&lt;ref name="ANN-death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-04-10/zero-no-tsukaima-author-noboru-yamaguchi-passes-away|title=Zero no Tsukaima Author Noboru Yamaguchi Passes Away|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later concluded in two volumes released in February 2016 and February 2017 with a different author, making use of notes left behind by Yamaguchi. The story features several characters from the second year class of a magic academy in a fictional magical world with the main characters being the inept mage Louise and her [[Familiar spirit|familiar]] from Earth, Saito Hiraga.

Between 2006 and 2012, the series was adapted by [[J.C.Staff]] into four [[anime]] television series and an additional [[original video animation]] episode. The first anime series was licensed by [[Geneon Entertainment]] in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since re-licensed and re-released the first series and released the other three series in North America. A [[manga]] version drawn by Nana Mochizuki was serialized in [[Media Factory]]'s manga magazine ''[[Monthly Comic Alive]]'' between August 2006 and October 2009. The manga was released by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] in North America. Three additional spin-off manga were also created, as were three [[visual novel]]s.

==Plot==
===Story and characters===
{{main|List of The Familiar of Zero characters}}
Louise is a noble girl who is terrible at magic, as her attempts usually result in an explosion. She is nicknamed "Louise the Zero" by her classmates, due to the inability to use any of the four magic elements. Early in the school year at the Tristain Academy of Magic, the second year students perform a special ritual where they summon their [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], which serves as their eternal protector and partner, and is usually some sort of magical creature. But Louise summons Saito Hiraga, an ordinary teenage boy from Japan, leaving her totally humiliated.

Due to the sacredness of the ritual, Louise reluctantly accepts Saito as her familiar, but proceeds to treat Saito as any other familiar, only worse, making him wash her clothes, sleep on a bed of hay, and whipping him with a riding crop when he upsets her. ''The Familiar of Zero'' follows the adventures of Louise and Saito as they help their classmates and friends, while occasionally blundering into situations where they risk their lives to save one another. Saito tries to find a way to get back to Japan, but he also has a mysterious power that allows him to wield swords and other weapons to perform heroic feats. They also eventually learn the truth behind Louise's magic inabilities. As Saito's and Louise's friendship grows and they start to work together, they ultimately fall in love with each other.[[File:Halkeginia map.png|left|thumb|The fictional continent of Halkeginia bears similarities to Europe.]]

===Setting===
;Halkeginia
:{{Nihongo|Halkeginia|ハルケギニア|Harukeginia}} is the continent that the story of ''The Familiar of Zero'' takes place on. Halkeginia's social structure is similar to the feudal class systems of Europe in the [[Middle Ages]], with magic-users being considered nobles. The continent itself is vaguely reminiscent in shape to western Europe, with many of the countries carrying ancient and Roman names.

;Tristain
:{{Nihongo|Tristain|トリステイン|Torisutein|also "Tristein"}} is the nation in which the majority of the story takes place. It is a small [[Monarchy|monarchical]] country located in the northwest of Halkeginia. It is under threat from Albion. Tristain is home to a highly acclaimed magical academy which attracts students from nearby countries known as the Tristain Academy of Magic. Militarily, the country is weak, with only a small permanent force, which forces it to make marriage alliances with other countries. The capital city is {{Nihongo|Tristania|トリスタニア|Torisutania}}. The country resembles [[Belgium]].

;Germania
:{{Nihongo|Germania|ゲルマニア|Gerumania}} is the largest kingdom in Halkeginia, and is also regarded as the strongest in terms of military might. It is regarded as a more barbaric and down-to-earth type of country, with its men considered to be brutish. Germania is located to the northeast of Tristain. Germania is the ancient Roman name for the region that is now Germany; the natives were at the time considered by the Romans to be barbarians. The country resembles [[Germany]].

;Gallia
:{{Nihongo|Gallia|ガリア|Garia|also "Galia"}} is another kingdom in Halkeginia, located to the southeast of Tristania. Germania is on its eastern border, in the Alden Forest. It is the second largest country in Halkeginia. Within the Gallia Royal Family, murders and assassination attempts have led to an unstable royalty. There is a city named La Rochelle in the mountains, which is a major port. The capital city is Beautis. Gallia is reminiscent of modern-day [[France]], which in the Roman era was called Gaul (Gallia in Latin).

;Albion
:{{Nihongo|Albion|アルビオン|Arubion}}, nicknamed the white country, is an island nation which is in a period of political strife. According to the storyline, a group of nobles known as Reconquista initiated a coup d'etat against the royalty, and over the course of the story, succeed in killing the entire Albion Royal Family. Cromwell, the leader of the Albion rebellion, seeks to spread his power elsewhere, and begins by attacking Tristain. Albion is the ancient Greek name for the main island of [[Great Britain]] upon which are the modern nations [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]]. The capital city of Albion is Londinium.

:Cromwell is named after the leader of the [[Roundheads]] during the English Civil War, [[Oliver Cromwell]], who successfully ousted the Monarchy, and establishing a brief reign as Lord Protector until the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

;Romalia
:{{Nihongo|Romalia|ロマリア|Romaria}} is a holy empire, located to the south of Gallia. There lies a city called Aquileia. Reminiscent of Italy, and specifically the [[Papal States]] (and the Vatican City, it is mentioned, that they have a pope and officials who are bound to celibacy), which once controlled much of central and northern [[Italy]].

===Magic===
:The nobles of Halkeginia are [[Magician (fantasy)|magicians]] known as "magi", and must use a wand or a staff to cast spells. Not all magi are nobles as some have given up their nobility to use their magic for thievery or to work as mercenaries.

:There are four primary magic elements: Ignis (''Fire''), Aqua (''Water''), Ventus (''Air''), and Terra (''Earth''). Magi have an affinity to one of those elements. There is a fifth element, the legendary lost branch of element, known as void. Magi can combine different magical elements or even stack the same element on top of itself to make spells more powerful. The power of a mage is determined by how many elements he or she can combine. There are four ranks of magician based upon this factor. Those who cannot combine any element together have the first rank, which is symbolized as a dot. Most magic students are in this class. The ability to combine two, three or four elements together leads to a magic user being referred to as a line, triangle, or square mage. In myths, there is a fifth rank called pentagram mage.

:One of the major themes is that humans and technology from Earth displaced into the world of Halkeginia are considered to be highly magical since Halkeginia itself has relatively primitive science and technology. For example, a magical item called the "Staff of Destruction" is, in reality, a human-made [[Vietnam War|Vietnam-era]] [[M72 LAW]] [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]]. Other examples of Earth technology, often weaponry, appear throughout the story, such as a [[World War II]] era [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter plane.

==Media==
===Light novels===
''The Familiar of Zero'' began as a series of [[light novel]]s written by [[Noboru Yamaguchi (author)|Noboru Yamaguchi]] and illustrated by [[Eiji Usatsuka]] under the original title ''Zero no Tsukaima''. [[Media Factory]] published 20 volumes in Japan between June 25, 2004 and February 25, 2011. Further publication was threatened by Yamaguchi's advanced cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-07-15/zero-no-tsukaima-yamaguchi-confirms-he-has-cancer|title=''Zero no Tsukaima''{{'}}s Yamaguchi Confirms He Has Cancer|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he succumbed to on April 4, 2013, leaving the series [[Unfinished creative work|unfinished]].&lt;ref name="ANN-death"/&gt; Yamaguchi had planned the series to end with 22 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-07-08/zero-no-tsukaima-author-noboru-yamaguchi-plans-surgery|title=''Zero no Tsukaima'' Author Noboru Yamaguchi Plans Surgery|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later decided by the publisher to continue the series in the author's absence, due in part to calls from fans to continue the series, as well as Yamaguchi's family wanting to see it completed. Yamaguchi had dictated the remaining plot of the series, including its ending, and entrusted it to the editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-25/the-familiar-of-zero-light-novels-to-continue-after-author-passing/.89697|title=The Familiar of Zero Light Novels to Continue After Author's Passing|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 25, 2015|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media Factory released volume 21 on February 25, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-11-24/the-familiar-of-zero-light-novels-1st-volume-after-creator-passing-scheduled/.95778|title=The Familiar of Zero Light Novels' 1st Volume After Creator's Passing Scheduled|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final volume 22 on February 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-03/the-familiar-of-zero-final-novel-volume-cover-art-book-previewed/.111809|title=The Familiar of Zero's Final Novel Volume Cover, Art Book Previewed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 3, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] licensed the series in 2007 under the title ''Zero's Familiar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011320/http://www.gomanga.com/manga/zerosfamiliar.php|url=http://www.gomanga.com/manga/zerosfamiliar.php|title=Zero's Familiar English light novel|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]|archivedate=2007-09-27|accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later cancelled the release of the novels.

A side-story, ''Zero no Tsukaima Gaiden: Tabatha no Bōken'', initially available as a mobile phone online serial, was released in three volumes between October 25, 2006 and March 25, 2009. It centers on the adventures of the character Tabitha, Louise's classmate. Another side story, ''Kaze no Kishihime'', was released in two volumes on October 23, 2009 and March 25, 2010. It is a prequel about Louise's mother youth. A companion volume, ''Zero no Tsukaima Memorial Book'', was released on June 24, 2017. It collected various short stories and illustrations previously unpublished in book format, as well as character designs and other information, such as outlines for volumes 21 and 22 left behind by Yamaguchi. It also revealed that the last two volumes of the series were written by Yū Shimizu, author of ''[[Bladedance of Elementalers]]'', using Yamaguchi's notes.

'''''The Red Balloon''''' ({{lang-fr|Le ballon rouge}}) is a 1956 French [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy-drama]] [[featurette]] written, produced, and directed by [[Albert Lamorisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0048980|title=The Red Balloon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thirty-five-minute&lt;ref name=bbfc/&gt; short, which follows the adventures of a young boy who one day finds a sentient, mute, red balloon, was filmed in the [[Ménilmontant]] neighbourhood of [[Paris]].

Lamorisse used his children as actors in the film. His son, Pascal, plays himself in the main role, and his daughter, Sabine, portrays a little girl.

The film won numerous awards, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lamorisse for writing the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] in 1956 and the [[Short Film Palme d'Or|Palme d'Or for short films]] at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]]. It also became popular with children and educators. It is the only short film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and to receive a nomination for anything besides [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]].

==Plot==
The film follows Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse), a young boy who, on his way to school one morning, discovers a large helium-filled red balloon. As he plays with it, he realizes it has a mind and will of its own. It begins to follow him wherever he goes, never straying far from him, and at times floating outside his bedroom window, as his mother will not allow it in their apartment.

The balloon follows Pascal through the streets of Paris, and they draw a lot of attention and envy from other children as they wander the streets. At one point the balloon enters his classroom, causing an uproar from his classmates. The noise alerts the principal, who locks Pascal up in his office. Later, after being set free, Pascal and the balloon encounter a little girl (Sabine Lamorisse) with a blue balloon that also seems to have a mind of its own, just like the red one.
One Sunday, the balloon is told to stay home while Pascal and his mother go to church. However, it follows them through the open window and into the church, and they are led out by a scolding [[beadle]].

In their wanderings around the neighborhood, Pascal and the balloon encounter a gang of older boys, who are envious of the balloon and attempt to steal it while Pascal is inside a bakery; however, he manages to retrieve it. Following a chase through narrow alleyways, the boys finally catch the balloon, throw stones at it, and bring it down with sling shots before one of the boys finish it off by stomping on it.

The film ends as all the other balloons in Paris come to Pascal's aid and take him on a [[cluster balloon]] ride over the city.

==Themes==
As the film was filmed in [[Paris]] after World War II, its mise-en-scene is quite dark and grey and therefore gives a depressing quality to the setting and mood.  In contrast, the balloon's bright colour acts as a symbol of hope and light within the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koresky|first1=Michael|title=The Red Balloon|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/655-the-red-balloon|website=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster balloon ride in the closing scene could also be said to represent a religious or spiritual analogy. For example, when the balloon is destroyed, its "spirit" lives on as it is transferred to all the other balloons in the city, which is said to be a metaphor for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alisashortfilm.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/the-red-balloon-1956/|title=The Red Balloon (1956)|date=2011-02-28|work=Notes on Short Film|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Themes of self-realisation and loneliness are also present in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/778-the-red-balloon-written-on-the-wind|title=The Red Balloon: Written on the Wind|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The theme of innocence is persistent and is one of the main focuses of the film. Through a child’s gaze, a cynical world is transformed into an almost magical one, highlighting the power of the innocence and imagination of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2007-11-23|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, authors such as Myles P. Breen have identified the film as having thematic/stylistic qualities that are reflective of the poetic medium. This perspective is rationalised by Breen through quoting film theorist Christian Metz, who states, “in a poem there is no story line, and nothing intrudes between the author and the reader”. The film, therefore, is categorised by Breen as being a filmic poem, partially due to its loose, non-narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BREEN|first=MYLES P.|date=1978|title=The Rhetoric of the Short Film|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20687433|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|volume=30|issue=3|pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film serves as a color record of the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] area of Paris, which had fallen into decay by the 1960s, prompting the Parisian government to demolish it as a slum-clearance effort. Part of the site was built up with housing projects; the remainder was left as wasteland for 20 years. Some of what is seen in the film no longer exists: one of the bakeries, the famous shaped staircase situated just beyond the equally famous café "Au Repos de la Montagne", the steep steps of the passage Julien Lacroix where Pascal finds the balloon, and the empty lot where all the battles take place. Instead stands the [[Parc de Belleville]]. Only the church still stands.

Albert Lamorrise was a former auditor at the [[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]] (IDHEC), and the crew that he used for the making of the film was entirely composed of IDHEC graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TESSONNEAU|first=RÉMY|last2=Ferguson|first2=Charles|date=1957|title=The French Institute Of Cinema (IDHEC)|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20686478|journal=Journal of the University Film Producers Association|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered and opened nationwide in France on 19 October 1956; it was released in the United Kingdom on 23 December 1956 (as the supporting film to the 1956 Royal Performance Film ''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'', which ensured it a [[Wide release|wide distribution]]) and in the United States on 11 March 1957.

It has been featured in many festivals over the years, including the Wisconsin International Children's Film Festival; the Los Angeles Outfest Gay and Lesbian Film Festival; the [[Wisconsin Film Festival]]; and others.

The film, in its American [[television]] premiere, was introduced by then-actor [[Ronald Reagan]] as an episode of the [[CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' on 2 April 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmovie title|id=40656|title=The Red Balloon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, the film was popular in elementary classrooms throughout the United States and Canada. A four-minute clip is on the rotating list of programming on [[Classic Arts Showcase]].

===Reception===
Since its first release in 1956, the film has generally received overwhelmingly favorable reviews from critics. The film critic for ''[[the New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]], hailed the simple tale and praised director Lamorisse, writing that "Yet with the sensitive cooperation of his own beguiling son and with the gray-blue atmosphere of an old Paris quarter as the background for the shiny balloon, he has got here a tender, humorous drama of the ingenuousness of a child and, indeed, a poignant symbolization of dreams and the cruelty of those who puncture them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E7DC1639E33BBC4A52DFB566838C649EDE|title=Screen: Documentary and Fantasy; 'Lost Continent,' 'Red Balloon' on Bill|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was re-released in the United States in late 2006 by [[Janus Films]], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] praised its direction and simple story line that reminded him of his youth, and wrote, "More than any other children's film, ''The Red Balloon'' turns me into a kid again whenever I see it...[to] see ''The Red Balloon'' is to laugh, and cry, at the impossible joy of being a child again."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20162166,00.html|title=The Red Balloon|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic Brian Gibson wrote, "So far, this seems a post-Occupation France happy to forget the blood and death of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] war a decade earlier. But soon people’s occasional, playful efforts to grab the floating, carefree balloon become grasping and destructive. In a gorgeous sequence, light streaming down alleys as children's shoes clack and clatter on the cobblestones, the balloon bouncing between the walls, Pascal is hunted down for his floating pet. Its ballooning sense of hope and freedom is deflated by a fierce, squabbling mass. Then, fortunately, it floats off, with the breeze of magic-realism, into a feeling of escape and peace, ''The Red Balloon'' taking hold of Pascal, lifting him out of this rigid, petty, earthbound life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20130205160335/http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=7536|title=What childhood films are these? :: Film :: VUE Weekly|date=2013-02-05|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: "[The film takes] place in a world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. ''The Red Balloon'' may be the most seamless fusion of [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop–-think [[Calvary]]–-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the [[New Testament]]. Thus is investment rewarded-–with Christian [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] or, at least, an old-fashioned [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. This might be sweet. Or it might be a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/22/AR2007112201315.html|title='Red Balloon' and 'White Mane': Childhood Colored by Adult Cynicism|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2007-11-23|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Reporters''''' is an American [[newsmagazine]] television program that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX Television]] during the [[1988-89 United States network television schedule|1988–89]] and [[1989-90 United States network television schedule|1989–90]] seasons.

==Format==
''The Reporters'' was structured much in the style of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] program ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV program)|A Current Affair]]'', except that there was no regular "host" role. As ''A Current Affair'' was produced for syndication by Fox, there was a considerable overlap in subject matter and some reporters even appeared on both programs. The premiere episode asked if [[Mike Tyson]] (whose marriage to [[Robin Givens]] was tabloid fodder at the time) was really gay.

Some segments from the program have since been seen in the present day in a historical context on [[Fox News Channel]] as part of their compilation series, ''From the Fox Files''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">'''The unsuccessful self-treatment of a case of "writer's block"''' is a [[humor]]ous [[academic article]] by psychologist Dennis Upper about [[writer's block]]. It contains no content outside title and journal formatting elements, including a humorous footnote. Published in 1974 in a peer reviewed journal, ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'', it is recognized as the shortest academic article ever&lt;ref name=realclearscience&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/01/shortest_science_papers.html|title=The Shortest Science Paper Ever Published Had No Words, and Was Utterly Brilliant - RealClearScience|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a classic example of humour in science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arnosimons.com/2013/06/20/humor-in-science-episode-1-writers-block/|title=Humor in Science (Episode 1: Writer’s Block) - arno simons|work=arno simons|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006112103/http://arnosimons.com/2013/06/20/humor-in-science-episode-1-writers-block/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the very least among [[behavioral psychology|behavioral psychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bassett|first1=John E.|title=Perspectives in Behavior Therapy (Book)|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|volume=43|issue=1|pages=105–105|doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4301_20|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been cited at least 60 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12780192540682800595&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5|title=Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article received a humorous positive review which was published alongside the article.&lt;ref name=realclearscience/&gt;

{{cquote|I have studied this manuscript very carefully with lemon juice and X-rays and have not detected a single flaw in either design or writing style. I suggest it be published without revision. Clearly it is the most concise manuscript I have ever seen-yet it contains sufficient detail to allow other investigators to replicate Dr. Upper's failure. In comparison with the other manuscripts I get from you containing all that complicated detail, this one was a pleasure to examine. Surely we can find a place for this paper in the Journal-perhaps on the edge of a blank page.}}

The article has led to at least three similarly humorous and peer-reviewed, published replication studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molloy|first1=Geoffery N.|title=THE UNSUCCESSFUL SELF-TREATMENT OF A CASE OF "WRITER'S BLOCK": A REPLICATION|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=57|issue=2|pages=566–566|doi=10.2466/pms.1983.57.2.566|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Didden|first1=Robert|last2=Sigafoos|first2=Jeff|last3=O'Reilly|first3=Mark F|last4=Lancioni|first4=Giulio E|last5=Sturmey|first5=Peter|last6=LeBlanc|first6=Linda|title=A Multisite Cross-Cultural Replication of Upper's (1974) Unsuccessful Self-Treatment of Writer's Block|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=40|issue=4|pages=773–773|doi=10.1901/jaba.2007.773|year=2007|pmc=2078566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HERMANN|first1=BRUCE P.|title=UNSUCCESSFUL SELF-TREATMENT OF A CASE OF 'WRITER'S BLOCK': A PARTIAL FAILURE TO REPLICATE|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=58|issue=2|pages=350–350|doi=10.2466/pms.1984.58.2.350|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several similar papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mclean|first1=Derrick C.|last2=Thomas|first2=Benjamin R.|title=UNSUCCESSFUL TREATMENTS OF "WRITER'S BLOCK": A META-ANALYSIS|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=115|issue=1|pages=276–278|doi=10.2466/28.PR0.115c12z0|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SKINNER|first1=NICHOLAS F.|last2=PERLINI|first2=ARTHUR H.|title=THE UNSUCCESSFUL GROUP TREATMENT OF 'WRITER'S BLOCK': A TEN-YEAR FOLLOW-UP|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=82|issue=1|pages=138–138|doi=10.2466/pms.1996.82.1.138|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=SKINNER|first1=NICHOLAS F.|last2=PERLINI|first2=ARTHUR H.|last3=FRIC|first3=LAWRENCE|last4=WERSTINE|first4=E.

More seriously, the paper is said to be a case reinforcing the image of a writer's block as a "blank page",&lt;ref name="Carter2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Vincent Carter|title=Rereading and Rewriting Bloc/ks: Teaching Multi-modal Literacies Through an Apprenticeship in Proper Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZRe4quXR1oC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-30355-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraging brevity in writing.&lt;ref name="Glasser2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen P.

'''Tickle Me Elmo''' is a children's [[plush toy]] from Tyco Preschool, a division of [[Tyco Toys]], of the [[The Muppets|Muppet]] character [[Elmo]] from the children's television show, [[Sesame Street]]. When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, "Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!".

The toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a [[fad|fad toy]]. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its [[MSRP]], had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

== Development ==
"Tickles The Chimp", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-10/news/9612100178_1_elmo-tickle-sesame-street-character | title=Toy Creator Unwraps Story Of Success | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=December 10, 1996 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Black, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as "Tickles The Chimp," which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make ''Sesame Street'' plush, but did have ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], they also made Tickle Me versions of baby [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Tweety]], they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do ''Looney Tunes'' but gained the rights to ''Sesame Street,'' thus starting Tickle Me Elmo.  The invention was originally introduced under [[Cabbage Patch Kids|Cabbage Patch]] at [[Hasbro]] Industries.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Neil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, "When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Chelsea|year=2009|title=Child's Play: Mattel's Neil Friedman Has Built a Career out of Toying Around—And Making Kids Smile|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-203927063|others={{subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|journal=[[Success (magazine)|Success]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996 Elmo craze==
Tickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the  [[Black Friday (shopping)|day after Thanksgiving]], when they suddenly sold out.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; With the [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers.&lt;ref name="desperate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baca|first=Maria Elena|date=10 December 1996|title=Desperate shoppers not laughing at Tickle Me Elmo|newspaper=Star Tribune|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62644967.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was helped by [[Rosie O'Donnell]], who had shown the toy on [[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|her popular TV show]] in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummins|first=H.

The scarcity of the new toy provoked a "shopping frenzy".&lt;ref name="frenzy"/&gt; Two women were arrested in [[Chicago]] for fighting over the doll,&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt; while in [[New York City|New York]] some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Riddell|first=Mary|date=20 December 1996|title=Spend!

During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, a crowd of 300 stampeded down the aisle after spotting him being handed a box of the toys by another employee.

By the end of December, the entire stock of one million "Tickle Me Elmo" toys had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|doi=|last=Constable|first=Burt|date=11 December 1997|title=The Aftermath of a Craze: Tickle Me Elmo Revisited|journal=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald ''(Arlington Heights, IL)'']]|volume=|issue=|pages=|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69036887.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}} "The company sold its entire supply of 1 million TMEs last year".

"[1996]: Tickle Me Elmo becomes the hottest toy of the holiday season. More than a million are sold that year alone."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further Tickle Me toys==
In early 1997, Tyco released new "Tickle Me" toys based on other characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' – first ''Tickle Me Ernie'' and ''Tickle Me Big Bird'', then ''Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo.&lt;ref name="hot toy"/&gt; With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, ''Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' and ''Mini Tickle Me Ernie'' were also put on the market.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The "Surprise Edition" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the "Surprise Edition" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Katie|date=11 October 2001|title=Elmo's Worth More Than a Tickle|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,47368,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TMX===
In 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, [[Fisher-Price]] released a new Elmo doll called ''TMX'', meaning "Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten" or "Tickle Me eXtreme".  The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention ([[River Forest, Illinois]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jedlowski|first=Jill|date=17 January 2007|title=Toy Story: TMX Elmo Creator Talks Business|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157884899.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first announced at the [[American International Toy Fair]]. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4x-VW_rCSE "Tickle Me Elmo X TMX Elmo"] (on Youtube).&lt;/ref&gt;

The full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing [[confidentiality agreement]]s. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of ''Toy Wishes'' magazine said, "The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.".&lt;ref name="top secret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Olivia|date=1 February 2006|title=Meet 'Top Secret Elmo'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-02-01-tickle-me-elmo_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Image:Tmx-elmo.jpg|TMX Elmo--&gt;
Toy analyst Chris Byrne told ''[[USA Today]]'', "This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category." Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. "The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon." He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since [[Furby]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="top secret"/&gt; However, some members of the media expected a large response.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[Toys "R" Us]] stores and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kotecki Vest|first=Erin|date=22 September 2006|title=Elmo Suckers Me to the Dark Side|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erin-kotecki-vest/elmo-suckers-me-to-the-da_b_30043.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which said the man "was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tickle pickle: Your Elmo or your life! |date=25 September 2006 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061727/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 [[financial year]] to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of [[financial analyst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=16 October 2006|title=Mattel Posts 6 Percent Rise in Profit|newspaper=AP Online|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-99173190.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=17 October 2006|title=Mattel Tops Expectations|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Post]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152989624.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In January 2007, Mattel announced it would release ''TMX Friends'', featuring Elmo, [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] and [[Cookie Monster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kavilanz|first=Parija B.|date=29 January 2007|title=Following T.M.X.

===eXtra Special Edition===
For the Christmas 2007 season, [[Fisher-Price]] released a version with hidden surprises.  [[Mattel]] has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmxspecialedition.com/ Fisher Price T.M.X. Special Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===LOL Elmo===
[[Playskool]] released the toy again as ''LOL Elmo''. Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's [[Sesame Street]] section, there is a sign printed "Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012".  Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
===Tickle Me Elmo (2017)===

[[Playskool]] made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like "Elmo is one ticklish monster". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20983">The 2007 dance-pop song "[[Do It (Nelly Furtado song)|Do It]]" performed by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Nelly Furtado]] features elements plagiarized from "Acidjazzed Evening", a [[chiptune]]-style track composed by the Finnish demoscene artist [[Janne Suni]]. [[Timbaland]], the song's producer, admitted to "[[sampling (music)|sampling]]" Suni's work, but did not believe his usage constituted "stealing", calling the allegations "ridiculous". Although users had noted the similarities between the two tracks on Finnish demoscene forums in July 2006, the '''Timbaland plagiarism controversy''' attracted mainstream attention in January 2007, when internet users posted videos to [[YouTube]] alleging Timbaland had plagiarised Suni's work. Soon afterwards, the controversy attracted the attention of the Finnish news portal eDome, and the [[MTV]] and [[Rolling Stone]] websites, who all published articles detailing the events of the controversy.&lt;ref name="Iltalehti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eDome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; 
"Do It" was released as the fifth North American [[single (music)|single]] from ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' on July 24, 2007.

==Background==
The original track, titled "Acidjazzed Evening", is a [[chiptune]]-style, 4-channel [[Amiga]] [[module file|module]] composed by [[Finland|Finnish]] [[demoscene]]r [[Janne Suni]] (a.k.a. Tempest).&lt;ref name="tempest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairlight.fi/tempest/ |title=Tempest's website |publisher=Fairlight.fi |date=2007-09-09 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song won first place in the Oldskool Music competition at [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly 2000]], a [[demoparty]] held in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=%2Fparties%2F2000%2Fassembly00%2Fresults.txt&amp;fileinfo |title=Scene.org's Assembly 2000 results data |publisher=Scene.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Scene.org]], the song was uploaded to their servers the same year, long before the release of the song by Furtado. The song was later remixed (with Suni's permission) by [[Norway|Norwegian]] Glenn Rune Gallefoss (a.k.a. GRG) for the [[Commodore 64]] in [[MOS Technology SID|SID format]] - this is the version which was later used for "Do It". It was added to the [[High Voltage SID Collection]] on December 21, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prg.dtu.dk/HVSC/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/Update34.hvs High Voltage SID Collection Update #34]&lt;/ref&gt;

A video which claims to show proof of the theft was posted to [[YouTube]] on January 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4KX7SkDe4Q "Producer Timbaland steals song from Finnish musician"], YouTube, January 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another video was posted to YouTube on January 14, 2007, claiming Timbaland also stole the tune a year earlier for the ringtone ''Block Party'', one of several that were sold in the United States in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube, [https://www.youtube.com/watc/h?v=wV2fTEeP6GM "Timbaland steals song - more proof!"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors' comments==

===Janne Suni===
Janne Suni posted the following comment regarding the copyright status of "Acidjazzed Evening" on January 15, 2007:
{{Quote|...I have never given up the copyrights of Acidjazzed Evening. I also have never authorized '''commercial''' use of the song. In 2002, however, Glenn Rune Gallefoss (also known as GRG) made a conversion/arrangement of the Acidjazzed Evening which was not released commercially. This arrangement was made on the Commodore 64 computer. It was authorized by me, and Glenn Rune Gallefoss explicitly asked for permission before releasing the arrangement.&lt;ref name="tempest"/&gt;}}

On February 16, 2007, he added the following note:

{{Quote|I'll correct one persistent misconception: I have been using the services of a [[law firm]] since September 2006. Things are gradually developing behind the scenes, and whatever the result turns out to be like, I'll publish any available info here as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="tempest"/&gt;}}

On September 9, 2007, his webpage was updated with the following information:
{{Quote|My case regarding the controversy has come to its closure. Just as before, I will not answer any questions about the case.&lt;ref name="tempest"/&gt;}}

===Glenn Gallefoss===
The C64 news portal C64.sk published the following comment from Glenn R. Gallefoss on January 15, 2007:

{{Quote|... Its my sid version that has been sampled in do-it : You can hear that by the 11 waveform bleeps I have put in at random places (only 3 voices on a sid you know), the arpeggios are using filters, I can even hear the lead using my multipulse routine (which i rarely use, but i did it on acidjazz.sid ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c64.sk/?content=news&amp;searchstring=UPDATE+15.+JAN+2007+15%3A20%3A+GRG |title=GRG’s cover of Tempest’s tune got ripped |publisher=C64.sk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 3, Gallefoss published the following comment on his personal web page:

{{Quote|Not much to tell about this matter. I have made a deal with my lawyers. Sometime in the near future, something will happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GRG/Shape |url=http://home.eunet.no/~ggallefo/ |title=GRG's web site / news |publisher=Home.eunet.no |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323074800/http://home.eunet.no/~ggallefo/ |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Universal / Nelly Furtado===
Hannu Sormunen, a Finnish representative of Universal, which represents [[Nelly Furtado]] in Finland, commented the controversy as follows in the January 15, 2007 issue of ''[[Iltalehti]]'':

{{Quote|In case that the artist decides to pursue the matter further, it's on him to go to America and confront them with the local use of law. It will require a considerable amount of faith and, of course, money.&lt;ref name="Iltalehti"&gt;[http://www.iltalehti.fi/popstars/200701145593138_ps.shtml "Onko Nellyn hitti Suomesta?"] ('''Finnish''')&lt;!-- An English alternative for this source would be appropriate, as it is not too hard to find (an American matter, after all). --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first legal action against Universal Finland was officially filed with Helsinki [[Judicial system of Finland|District Court]] in mid-August 2007, on behalf of Glenn R. Gallefoss.

===Timbaland===
On February 2, 2007, Timbaland responded to the [[plagiarism]] accusations in an interview by the radio show ''[[Elliot in the Morning]]''. In this interview, Timbaland admits to what he calls "sampling", but he also claims that sampling is "not stealing", because "everybody samples from everybody every day". Timbaland also says that the sample is "from a video game" and mentions the Commodore 64. He also says that he has no time for research and that it is sometimes impossible to "know what's [[public domain]] and what's not". Timbaland also calls the issue "ridiculous" but mentions that he is "in legal discussions" and therefore was not able to say much about it. He did, however, call Janne Suni an "idiot" and a "freakin' jerk" on the show. He consistently talked about the incident as sampling, failing to address the claims with regards to the melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zxdemo.org/extra/timbaland_radio_transcript.txt |title=Elliot in the Morning - Timbaland interviewed transcript |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2007, Timbaland commented on the issue as follows in an MTV interview:

==Third-party analysis==
A device in Timbaland's studio, as seen in video clips from the [[MTV]] show ''Timbaland's Diary'', has been identified as an [[Elektron SidStation]].&lt;ref name="eDome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C64Audio" /&gt; This device is a MIDI-controlled synthesizer based on the [[MOS Technology SID|SID chip]] of the Commodore 64, and it is capable of playing back .sid files the way they would have sounded on the original hardware. It has been speculated that Timbaland downloaded Gallefoss' version of the song from the High Voltage SID Collection&lt;ref name="C64Audio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heise" /&gt; and used the SidStation for running it to the studio system.&lt;ref name="eDome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C64Audio" /&gt;

Chris Abbott, maintainer of the website [http://www.c64audio.com/ C64Audio.com], posted an in-depth analysis on the topic and summarizes it in his on-line article. Abbott has commercially released Commodore 64 music, most notably the "Back in Time" CD series. Abbott writes:
{{Quote|What appears to have happened is that the three-voice output from the original C64 version has had the bass voice silenced: that missing bass voice then follows the original tune except for a couple of changed notes, and the removal of some octave jumps. However, various technical procedures show that other components of the song (chords/melody/rhythm) have been exactly reproduced. This is vanishingly unlikely to have happened by chance.&lt;ref name="C64Audio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c64audio.com/timbaland.php |title=Chris Abbott: Doin' it for themselves: what's going on in Timbaland? |publisher=C64audio.com |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815105110/http://www.c64audio.com/timbaland.php |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abbott also notes that although the evidence seems to be conclusive, the eventual outcome is not.

==Court proceedings==
In August 2007, an action for infringement was filed in the District Court of Helsinki against Universal Music, Ltd alleging Nelly Furtado's song "Do It" infringed "Acidjazzed Evening".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/timbaland-nelly-furtado-sued-for-plagiarism-210149 MusicRadar: Timbaland, Nelly Furtado sued for plagiarism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2009/06/19/timbaland-finally-su.html BoingBoing: Timbaland finally sued over chiptune plagiarism]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, after a trial that included multiple expert and technical witnesses, a three judge panel unanimously dismissed the plaintiff's case.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

On December 17, 2008, Abbott also testified as a witness of prosecution in the Helsinki court in Gallefoss' case against Universal Music Finland. The Finnish court reportedly threw out the case after ruling in only one aspects of the three claims (sampling, performance rights, producer rights), and the case remains in [[appellate court]], as of January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remix64.com/board/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=6043&amp;p=75883 |title=Commodore Remix - Timbaland Court Case starts on Wednesday |publisher=Remix64.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2009, Mikko Välimäki, who is one of the legal counsels of Kernel Records, the owner of the sound recording rights, reported that the case had been filed in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turre.com/2009/06/kernel-records-v-timbaland-enters-a-court-in-florida/ |title= ''Kernel Records v.

Mosley'' ended with the court deciding that Kernel Records had failed to register for copyright in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyhype.com/2011/06/timbaland-wins-2nd-sampling-lawsuit-in-3-months/|title=Copyhype: Timbaland wins 2nd Sampling Lawsuit in 3 Months|work=Copyhype|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyhype.com/2011/06/timbaland-wins-2nd-sampling-lawsuit-in-3-months/ Copyhype: Timbaland wins 2nd Sampling Lawsuit in 3 Months]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar cases==
Earlier examples of unauthorized commercial use of SID music have been brought up by sources covering the Timbaland plagiarism controversy.

An often-mentioned example is [[Zombie Nation (band)|Zombie Nation]]'s 1999 hit ''[[Kernkraft 400]]'', which was a remake of [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]]'s song for the 1984 Commodore 64 game ''[[Lazy Jones]]''. Legal action is pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/NME/External/News/News_Story/0,1004,9126,00.html |title=NME: OK COMPUTER! |publisher= |accessdate=16 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010630145207/http://www.nme.com/NME/External/News/News_Story/0,1004,9126,00.html |archivedate=June 30, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] hit ''You've Got My Love'', for which the artist [[Bas Bron|Bas "Bastian" Bron]] sampled the drums from [[Jeroen Tel]]'s and [[Reyn Ouwehand]]'s song made for the [[Rubicon (game)|Rubicon]] game. Both of the cases were won by the original authors in court.&lt;ref name="eDome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C64Audio" /&gt;

The [[Fitts for Fight]] case also involved copied chipmusic.

In April 2008, a similar case was revealed about self-proclaimed "chiptune maestro" [[Laromlab]], who released his self-titled album on [[Mushpot Records]]; shortly after it was discovered that the entire album is in fact the work of a chiptune collective called the YM Rockerz. Mushpot responded by dropping Laromlab immediately from the label,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mushpotrecords.com/news/ |title=Mushpot Records |publisher=Mushpot Records |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Laromlab himself has issued an apology, stating the "project was a hoax, a complete fallacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=63047429&amp;loc=interstitialskip |title=CMJ News Story |publisher=Prod1.cmj.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==

===The beginnings of the controversy===
The earliest [[internet forum]] posts suggesting that "Do It" was based on "Acidjazzed Evening" date back to July 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vee.fi/musiikki/levyt/nelly_furtado/loose/kayttajien_arviot/ Vee.fi user reviews of Nelly Furtado: Loose] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718213628/http://www.vee.fi/musiikki/levyt/nelly_furtado/loose/kayttajien_arviot/ |date=July 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Finnish news portal [[eDome]], "Suni and other demoscene hobbyists" already knew about it at this time.&lt;ref name="eDome"/&gt;&lt;!-- An English alternative for this source would be appropriate, as it is not too hard to find (an American matter, after all). --&gt;

===Mainstream coverage===
One of the first large media to react to the on-line controversy was the [[YLE|Finnish Broadcasting Company]], which published a news item on the topic on January 14, 2007.&lt;ref name="YLE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kulttuuri/id51183.html|title=Amerikkalaista hiphop-tuottaja Timbalandia syytetään suomalaisen plagioinnista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic music magazine [[Side-Line]] put a complete news round-up up on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=20102_0_2_0_C |title=Did Björk producer Timbaland steal music from demoscene? More evidences showing up ! |publisher=Side-line.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish tabloids [[Ilta-Sanomat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/viihde/uutinen.asp?id=1301161|title=Suosittu jenkkibiisi onkin suomalaiskopio?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iltalehti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/popstars/200701145593138_ps.shtml|title=Onko Nellyn hitti Suomesta?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and newspapers ITviikko,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itviikko.fi/page.php?page_id=15&amp;news_id=20071045|title=Hittituottaja varasti suomalaisen Amiga-biisin?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DigiToday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitoday.fi/page.php?page_id=11&amp;news_id=20071051|title=Veisaako Nelly Furtado Suomesta varastettua Amiga-biisiä?}}&lt;/ref&gt; also published articles about the suspected plagiarism on January 15, 2007.

On January 16, Finnish news portal [[eDome]] published an article about the case saying in the English summary that:

{{Quote|It is beyond any doubt that Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley has directly copied large sections of Janne Suni’s songs, much more than any "fair use" would allow. Timbaland has not sampled tiny bits or effects from the song, but whole sections. This is a clear breach of copyright.&lt;ref name="eDome"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plaza.fi/harrastukset/edome/artikkelit/yleiset/yhdysvaltalaistuottaja-polli-suomalaismuusikolta |title=Yhdysvaltalaistuottaja pölli suomalaismuusikolta |publisher=Plaza.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223023640/http://plaza.fi/harrastukset/edome/artikkelit/yleiset/yhdysvaltalaistuottaja-polli-suomalaismuusikolta |archivedate=2007-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The article also covered similar cases from the past and notified that both the competition and the prize ceremony "were witnessed by the 4000-5000 people at the event. The competition and the ceremony were also shown in Helsinki area cable TV".&lt;ref name="eDome"/&gt; The same day, the news reached Norwegian media, including [[Norsk rikskringkasting|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/kanal/nrk_p3/5828277.html|title=Norsk offer i plagiat-skandale}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dagbladet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/01/16/489070.html|title=Anklager stjerneprodusent for juks}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which interviewed Gallefoss.

On January 17, the case was reported on briefly by the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/16/kanye-west-and-fall-out-boy-get-intimate-finnish-artists-after-nelly-furtado-jamie-foxx-parses-own-vocabulary/|title=Finnish Artists After Nelly Furtado?}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name="XXL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge Of The Nerds - Timbaland vs. The Internet}}[https://web.archive.org/web/20080315063000/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=6979 archived copy] at the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;
and the popular German IT news portal [[Heinz Heise|Heise online]]. Heise's story suggests that Timbaland downloaded Gallefoss's SID arrangement from the [[The High Voltage SID Collection|High Voltage SID Collection]].&lt;ref name="Heise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/83835|title=Hiphop-Produzent wilderte in C64-Musikarchiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' put the controversy as top news of the day with a more detailed article.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite news|url=
https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/staff-blog/is-timbaland-a-thief-20070118|date= 18 January 2007| title=Is Timbaland a Thief?|newspaper=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' covered the story in their blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2007/01/did_super_produ.html|title=Did Super Producer Timbaland copy the track of "Do It" off of Finnish producer Janne Suni?| newspaper= San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, [[MTV]] took notice of the issue with a longer article and according video-news. It is not clear if this video news was actually broadcast or merely posted online.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1550506/20070122/timbaland.jhtml|title=YouTube Clip Claims Timbaland Got Furtado Track From Finnish Dude}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV-owned sister station [[VH-1]] also published the MTV news story. MTV had apparently tried to reach Timbaland's representatives via phone and e-mail, but they "had not responded at press time".&lt;ref name="MTV" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">The {{nihongo|'''Tomica Hero Series'''|トミカヒーローシリーズ|Tomika Hīrō Shirīzu}} was a short-lived series of [[Japan]]ese [[tokusatsu]] [[children's television|children's]] [[Japanese television drama|television drama]]s. Based on [[Takara Tomy]]'s [[Tomica]] [[toy car]] line, the series air on [[TV Aichi]] and [[TV Tokyo]] before being [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] around Japan. Takara Tomy previously produced ''[[Madan Senki Ryukendo]]'',&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-aichi.co.jp/rescue-force/staff/staff.html|title=レスキューフォース_テレビ愛知|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Ryukendo'' was not based on a pre-existing set of toys for the company. However, it made reference to the Earth Federation which the UFDA is a branch of, its main cast making a cameo in the ''Rescue Force'' movie. Although airing on different days, the Tomica Hero Series served as competition to [[TV Asahi]] and [[Toei Company]]'s [[Super Sentai]] and [[Kamen Rider Series]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]]' [[Ultra Series]]. Only two series were made with the Tomica Hero story, which concluded with a stage show featuring members of the ''Rescue Force'' cast.

==List of series==
* {{nihongo|''[[Tomica Hero: Rescue Force]]''|トミカヒーロー　レスキューフォース|Tomika Hīrō Resukyū Fōsu}}: Airing from April 2008 to April 2009, the series featured a team of [[emergency service]] workers saving Japan from an organization trying to cause mayhem with artificial crises, as well as saving citizens from [[natural disaster]]s. ''Rescue Force'' also had a film subtitled {{nihongo|''Rescue the Mach Train!''|マッハトレインをレスキューせよ！|Mahha Torein o Resukyū seyo!}}, which the main cast of Ryukendo made a cameo in. The show's theme deals with "Rescue Soul", a term used in the series to describe what a rescuer stands for.
* {{nihongo|''[[Tomica Hero: Rescue Fire]]''|トミカヒーロー　レスキューファイアー|Tomika Hīrō Resukyū Faiā}}: Airing from April 4, 2009 to March 27, 2010 and a continuation of the first, ''Rescue Fire'' focuses on another group of emergency service workers who are solely [[firefighter]]s, with its theme dealing with the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|value of life]]. The series also continues the plot device of the villains acting for the planet's sake. The series' opening [[music in Japanese animation|theme song]]s are performed by ''anison'' [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[JAM Project]].

In comedy, a '''visual gag''' or '''sight gag''' is anything which conveys its [[humour]] visually, often without words being used at all. The gag may involve a physical impossibility or an unexpected occurrence.&lt;ref name=LifeSightGagRevival&gt;{{cite news|title=Sight Gag Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xFUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22sight+gag%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6pr_TuyKPMzisQL-voWtAQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sight%20gag%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=3 February 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humor is caused by alternative interpretations of the goings-on.&lt;ref name=Carroll146&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Noel|title=Theorizing the moving image|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46049-1|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpPOPQyOzb8C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22sight+gag%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6pr_TuyKPMzisQL-voWtAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sight%20gag%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual gags are used in magic, plays, and acting on television or movies.

==Types==
The most common type of visual gag is based on multiple interpretations of a series of events.&lt;ref name=Carroll148&gt;Carroll, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; This type is used in the 1935 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]''. Lead actor [[Robert Donat]] was kidnapping actress [[Madeleine Carroll]] and they were handcuffed. When they checked into an inn, the innkeeper assumed that they were passionate lovers because of the handcuffs.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt; The film used dialogue that could be interpreted both ways.&lt;ref name=Carroll148 /&gt;

Another visual gag is a switched image, often at the beginning of a film. A subsequent view of the scene shows something not viewed before.&lt;ref name=Carroll152&gt;Carroll, page 152&lt;/ref&gt; Switched movement may be the gag, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] in ''[[The Pawnshop]]''. Chaplin fights with his coworker and punches at him once. Their boss walks in mid-swing and Chaplin changes the motion to act like he was dropping to his knees to scrub the floor.&lt;ref name=Carroll152 /&gt; 

Noel Carroll established the most influential taxonomy of sight gags, breaking down the varieties into six types, two of which are enumerated below.

Mutual Interference: The audience is fully aware of the on-screen situation, but a character comically misunderstands

Mimed Metaphor: A variety of virtual simile an object may be treated as if it is a different object or be used in an unconventional way, such as acting like a [[doughnut]] is a [[barbell]] or using a tuba as an umbrella holder.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, page 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are numerous examples in cinema history of directors who based most of the humor in their films on visual gags, even to the point of using no or minimal dialogue. Visual gags began in live theater.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt; The first known use of a visual gag in a film was in the [[Lumière brothers]]' 1895 short, ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]'' ("The Waterer Watered"), in which a gardener watering his plants becomes the subject of a boy's prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaines|first=Jane M.|title=Early Cinema's Heyday of Copying|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~bookworm/gaines-cinema.pdf|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=31 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111220145/http://www.indiana.edu/~bookworm/gaines-cinema.pdf|archive-date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early pioneer in visual gags was [[Georges Méliès]]. The filmmaker experimented with techniques in the then-new film media creating techniques to trick viewers.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt;

[[Vaudeville]] actors often used gags in their routines. A classic vaudeville visual gag was for two actors to mirror each other's actions around a prop.&lt;ref name=NYTimesHolidayBooks /&gt;  Visual gags were continued into [[silent film]]s and are considered a hallmark of the genre.&lt;ref name=Carroll146 /&gt; In silent films, the actors in the mirror bit performed in silence with no music playing.&lt;ref name=NYTimesHolidayBooks /&gt;  Comedians including [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]] and the [[Marx Brothers]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesHolidayBooks&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Dana|title=Holiday Books: Movies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/books/review/Stevens-t.html?scp=51&amp;sq=%22sight+gag%22+-%22Laugh+Lines+Blog%22&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used visual humour because the technology used to record voices in film (and play it back in a synchronized presentation) did not yet exist. Often the differences between people are part of the comic duos, especially thin and fat actors are used such as [[Abbott and Costello]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' cites the fourth ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' episode, "Goodnight, Sweet Skipper", as a classic American sight gag.&lt;ref name=NYTimesNewSitcoms&gt;{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title=Naked Truth: New Sitcoms Are Reruns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/arts/television/new-girls-2-broke-girls-last-man-standing-new-season-for-old-jokes.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq&amp;st=nyt&amp;%2334;Laugh%20Lines%20Blog&amp;%2334;sight%20gag&amp;%2334;&amp;%2334;%20-&amp;scp=3|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castaways were trying to contact civilization with a [[radio]]. In the episode, Skipper can recall only how he converted the radio into a [[transmitter]] in [[World War II]] when he was [[sleepwalking]]. After Skipper was unsuccessful, Gilligan got it to work by pounding on the radio; he used it to briefly contact a pilot flying overhead. Gilligan retrieved Skipper and demonstrated how he pounded on the radio, causing the guts of the radio to fall out. Their rescue was foiled.&lt;ref name=NYTimesNewSitcoms /&gt;

A '''workshop production''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] performance, in which a play or musical is staged in a modest form which does not include some aspects of a full production. For example, costumes, sets and musical accompaniment may be excluded, or may be included in a simpler form.

One common purpose of a workshop production is to provide a [[preview (theatre)|preview]] staging of a new work in order to gauge audience and critical reaction, following which some parts of the work may be adjusted or rewritten before the work's official [[premiere]]. Because a workshop production generally pays less for the rights to perform the play, workshop productions also provide an opportunity for smaller theatres to generate increased publicity by staging a popular or highly anticipated work for which a full production might be too costly. Some theatre companies, in fact, specialize exclusively in workshop productions; amateur and youth theatre companies, for example, are commonly structured on the workshop production model.

Some fictional works, including the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' and the television series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]'', depict the audition and workshop processes of developmental theatrical productions.
