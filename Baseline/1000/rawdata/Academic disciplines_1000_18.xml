'''Bioconcentration''' is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Environmental Toxicology: Molecular Structures to Ecological Landscapes|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4398-0410-0|pages=117–162|vauthors=Landis WG, Sofield RM, Yu MH |edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of [[aquatic toxicology]].&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.&lt;ref name="Gobas and Morrison Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Property Estimation Methods for Chemicals: Environmental and Health Sciences|year=2000|publisher=Lewis|location=Boca Raton, FL, USA|author=Gobas FAPC|authorlink=Bioconcentration and bioaccumulation in the aquatic environment|author2=Morrison HA|editor=Boethling RS |editor2=Mackay D |pages=189–231|chapter=Biococentration and biomagnification in the aquatic environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which to measure and assess [[bioaccumulation]] and bioconcentration.  These include: octanol-water [[partition coefficient]]s (K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;), bioconcentration factors (BCF), bioaccumulation factors (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF).  Each of these can be calculated using either [[empirical data]] or measurements as well as from [[mathematical models]].&lt;ref name="Arnot and Gobas (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnot|first=Jon A.|author2=Frank A.P.C. Gobas|title=A Food Web Bioaccumulation Model for Organic Chemicals in Aquatic Ecosystems|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|year=2004|volume=23|issue=10|pages=2343–2355|doi=10.1897/03-438}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these mathematical models is a [[fugacity]]-based BCF model developed by [[Donald Mackay (scientist)|Don Mackay]].&lt;ref name="Mackay (1982)-Fugacity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Don|title=Correlation of bioconcentration factors|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=1982|volume=16|pages=274–278|doi=10.1021/es00099a008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioconcentration factor can also be expressed as the ratio of the concentration of a [[chemical]] in an [[organism]] to the [[concentration]] of the chemical in the surrounding [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. The BCF is a measure of the extent of chemical sharing between an organism and the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Ecology PBT Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 173–333 WAC Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxins|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/laws-rules/wac173333/p0407_cont_a.pdf|work=Department of Ecology|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In surface water, the BCF is the ratio of a chemical's concentration in an organism to the chemical's aqueous concentration.  BCF is often expressed in units of liter per kilogram (ratio of mg of chemical per kg of organism to mg of chemical per liter of water).&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hemond|first=Harold|title=Chemical Fate and Transport in the Environment|year=2000|publisher=Elsevier|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0-12-340275-2|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCF can simply be an observed ratio, or it can be the prediction of a partitioning model.&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt; A partitioning model is based on assumptions that chemicals partition between water and aquatic organisms as well as the idea that chemical equilibrium exists between the organisms and the aquatic environment in which it is found&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

== Calculation ==

Bioconcentration can be described by a bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is the ratio of the chemical concentration in an organism or biota to the concentration in water:&lt;ref name="Gobas and Morrison Book" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;BCF=\frac{Concentration_{Biota}}{Concentration_{Water}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Gobas and Morrison Book" /&gt;

Bioconcentration factors can also be related to the octanol-water partition coefficient, K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;. The octanol-water [[partition coefficient]] (K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;) is correlated with the potential for a chemical to [[bioaccumulate]] in organisms; the BCF can be predicted from log K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;, via computer programs based on [[structure activity relationship]] (SAR)&lt;ref name="USEPA PBT Info."&gt;{{cite web|title=Category for Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic New Chemical Substances|url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-TOX/1999/November/Day-04/t28888.htm|work=Federal Register Environmental Documents|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=3 June 2012|author=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through the [[linear equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;log BCF=m log K_{OW}+b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Mussel Study"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergen|first=Barbara J.|author2=William G. Nelson|author3=Richard J. Pruell|title=Bioaccumulation of PCB Congeners by Blue Mussels (''Mytilus edulis'') deployed in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|year=1993|volume=12|pages=1671–1681|doi=10.1002/etc.5620120916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;K_{OW}=\frac{Concentration_{octanol}}{Concentration_{water}}=\frac{C_O}{C_W}&lt;/math&gt; at equilibrium

=== Fugacity capacity ===
Fugacity and BCF relate to each other in the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;Z_{Fish}=\frac{P_{Fish}\times{BCF}}{H}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

where Z&lt;sub&gt;Fish&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the [[Fugacity capacity]] of a chemical in the fish, P&lt;sub&gt;Fish&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the density of the fish (mass/length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), BCF is the partition coefficient between the fish and the water (length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mass) and H is equal to the Henry's law constant (Length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Time&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Regulatory uses ===
Through the use of the [[Persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemical|PBT]] Profiler and using criteria set forth by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] under the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), a substance is considered to be not bioaccumulative if it has a BCF less than 1000, bioaccumulative if it has a BCF from 1000–5000&lt;ref name="BCF Range"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioaccumulation Criteria|url=http://www.pbtprofiler.net/criteria.asp|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and very bioaccumulative if it has a BCF greater than 5,000.&lt;ref name="BCF Range" /&gt;

The thresholds under [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] are a BCF of &gt; 2000 l/kg bzw. for the B and 5000 l/kg for vB criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/13632/information_requirements_r11_en.pdf Guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment: Chapter R.11: PBT Assessment (Version 1.1)], 2012, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
A bioconcentration factor greater than 1 is indicative of a [[hydrophobic]] or [[lipophilic]] chemical.  It is an indicator of how probable a chemical is to [[bioaccumulate]].&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; These chemicals have high lipid affinities and will concentrate in tissues with high lipid content instead of in an aqueous environment like the [[cytosol]].   Models are used to predict chemical partitioning in the environment which in turn allows the prediction of the biological fate of lipophilic chemicals.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt;

=== Equilibrium partitioning models ===
Based on an assumed steady state scenario, the fate of a chemical in a system is modeled giving predicted endpoint phases and concentrations.&lt;ref name=Rand&gt;{{cite book|last=Rand|first=Gary|title=Fundamentals of Aquatic Toxicology|year=1995|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=1-56032-091-5|pages=494–495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It needs to be considered that reaching steady state may need a substantial amount of time as estimated using the following equation (in hours).&lt;ref&gt;OECD GUIDELINES FOR TESTING OF CHEMICALS: Test No. 305: Bioaccumulation in Fish: Aqueous and Dietary Exposure, S. 56, [[doi: 10.1787/9789264185296-en]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawker D.W. and Connell D.W. (1988), Influence of partition coefficient of lipophilic compounds on bioconcentration kinetics with fish. Wat. Res. 22: 701–707, [[doi: 10.1016/0043-1354(88)90181-9]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t_{eSS}=0.00654 \cdot K_{OW} + 55.31&lt;/math&gt;

For a substance with a log(K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;) of 4, it thus takes approximately five days to reach effective steady state. For a log(K&lt;sub&gt;OW&lt;/sub&gt;) of 6, the equilibrium time increases to nine months.

=== Fugacity models ===
Fugacity is another predictive criterion for equilibrium among phases that has units of pressure.  It is equivalent to partial pressure for most environmental purposes. It is the absconding propensity of a material.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; BCF can be determined from output parameters of a fugacity model and thus used to predict the fraction of chemical immediately interacting with and possibly having an effect on an organism.

=== Food web models ===
If organism-specific [[fugacity]] values are available, it is possible to create a food web model which takes [[Food web|trophic webs]] into consideration.&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt; This is especially pertinent for [[conservative chemicals]] that are not easily metabolized into degradation products. [[Biomagnification]] of conservative chemicals such as toxic metals can be harmful to [[apex predators]] like [[killer whales|orca whales]], [[osprey]], and [[bald eagles]].

== Applications to toxicology ==

=== Predictions ===
Bioconcentration factors facilitate predicting contamination levels in an organism based on chemical concentration in surrounding water.&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; BCF in this setting only applies to aquatic organisms. Air breathing organisms do not take up chemicals in the same manner as other aquatic organisms.  Fish, for example uptake chemicals via [[ingestion]] and osmotic gradients in [[gill lamellae]].&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

When working with [[benthic macroinvertebrates]], both water and [[benthic]] sediments may contain chemical that affects the organism. Biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) and [[biomagnification factor]] (BMF) also influence toxicity in aquatic environments.

BCF does not explicitly take metabolism into consideration so it needs to be added to models at other points through uptake, elimination or degradation equations for a selected organism.

=== Body burden ===
Chemicals with high BCF values are more lipophilic, and at equilibrium organisms will have greater concentrations of chemical than other phases in the system. Body burden is the total amount of chemical in the body of an organism,&lt;ref name=Rand /&gt; and body burdens will be greater when dealing with a lipophilic chemical.

== Biological factors ==
In determining the degree at which bioconcentration occurs biological factors have to be kept in mind.The rate at which an organism is exposed through respiratory surfaces and contact with dermal surfaces of the organism, competes against the rate of excretion from an organism. The rate of excretion is a loss of chemical from the respiratory surface, growth dilution, fecal excretion, and [[metabolic biotransformation]].&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt; Growth dilution is not an actual process of excretion but due to the mass of the organism increasing while the contaminant concentration remains constant dilution occurs.

The interaction between inputs and outputs is shown here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dC_{B}}{dt}=(k_{1}C_{WD})-(k_{2}+k_{E}+k_{M}+k_{G})C_{B}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The variables are defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;is the concentration in the organism (g*kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;
t represents a unit of time (d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;
k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the rate constant for chemical uptake from water at the respiratory surface (L*kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;*d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;WD&lt;/sub&gt; is the chemical concentration dissolved in water (g*L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;
k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,k&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;,k&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;,k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are rate constants that represent excretion from the organism from the respiratory surface, fecal excretion, metabolic transformation, and growth dilution (d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt;

Static variables influence BCF as well. Because organisms are modeled as bags of fat, lipid to water ratio is a factor that needs to be considered.&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt; Size also plays a role as the surface to volume ratio influence the rate of uptake from the surrounding water.&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt; The species of concern is a primary factor in influencing BCF values due to it determining all of the biological factors that alter a BCF.&lt;ref name="Fate and Transport Book" /&gt;

== Environmental parameters ==

=== Temperature ===
Temperature may affect metabolic transformation, and bioenergetics. An example of this is the movement of the organism may change as well as rates of excretion.&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF" /&gt; If a contaminant is ionic, the change in pH that is influenced by a change in temperature may also influence the bioavailability&lt;ref name="Tox. II Book" /&gt;

=== Water quality ===
The natural particle content as well as organic carbon content in water can affect the bioavailability. The contaminant can bind to the particles in the water, making uptake more difficult, as well as become ingested by the organism. This ingestion could consist of contaminated particles which would cause the source of contamination to be from more than just water.&lt;ref name="Review article of BCF and BAF"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnot|first=Jon|author2=Frank A.P.C. Gobas|title=A review of bioconcentration factor (BCF) and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) assessments for organic chemicals in aquatic organisms|journal=NRC Canada|date=13 December 2006|volume=12|pages=257–297|doi=10.1139/A06-005|url=http://research.rem.sfu.ca/papers/gobas/A%20Review%20of%20Bioconcentration%20factor%20(BCF)%20and.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">'''Biological integrity''' is associated with how "pristine" an [[natural environment|environment]] is and its function relative to the potential or original state of an [[ecosystem]] before human alterations were imposed. Biological integrity is built on the assumption that a decline in the values of an ecosystem's [[Aquatic ecosystem#Functions|functions]] are primarily caused by human activity or alterations. The more an environment and its original processes are altered, the less biological integrity it holds for the [[community (ecology)|community]] as a whole. If these processes were to change over time naturally, without human influence, the integrity of the ecosystem would remain intact. The integrity of the ecosystem relies heavily on the processes that occur within it because those determine what [[organism]]s can inhabit an area and the complexities of their interactions.

==History==
The concept of biological integrity first appeared in the 1972 amendments to the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"The objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." Clean Water Act, section 101(a), {{USC|33|1251(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had used the term as a way to gauge the standards to which [[water]] should be maintained, but the vocabulary instigated years of debate about the implications of not only the meaning of biological integrity, but also how it can be [[Water quality#Measurement|measured]]. The first conference about the term occurred in March 1975 called "The Integrity of Water"&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, R.K. and L.J. Guarraia (editors)(1977). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrccatalog.nsf/e673c95b11602f2385256ae1007279fe/0fdf60b25f9fc7b585256b0600723dc0!OpenDocument ''The Integrity of Water.''] Proceedings of a Symposium, March 10–12, 1975, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. EPA Publication No. 832-R-75-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  and provided the first accepted definition of biological integrity (see below). In 1981, EPA assembled a field of experts from the U.S. [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], academia, and its own staff to further refine the definition and identify key [[bioindicator|indicators]] to quantitatively measure biological integrity. The conference not only identified a definition, but also methods to evaluate the community, and they established that multiple sites should be used to determine the condition of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.M., J.H.

==Definition==
Today, the accepted definition is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref&gt;Karr, J.R. and D.R. Dudley (1981).

[http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf "Biological integrity of water: an historical approach."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217084900/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} Pages 127-140 in Ballentine and Guarraia, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this definition are that [[living systems]] have a variety of scales relative to which they exist, that one can quantify the parts that sustain or contribute to a system's functioning and that all systems must be seen in the context of their environments and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary]] history. This term primarily refers to [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] because the vocabulary is derived from the Clean Water Act, but the concepts can be applied to other ecosystems.

==Evaluation methods==
In order to quantify and evaluate the biological integrity of a system, the '''[[Index of biological integrity|Index of Biological Integrity]] (IBI)''' was created.&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. (1981).

The IBI evaluates the ecosystem by utilizing [[biosurvey]]s and comparing [[species richness]], indicator [[taxon|taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], and [[invasive species]]. IBIs are used primarily to evaluate [[aquatic ecosystem]]s even though one could technically apply any measurement of biological integrity to any natural ecosystem.

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

The '''classical education movement''' advocates a form of education based in the traditions of [[Western culture]], with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].  The curriculum and pedagogy of classical education was first developed during the Middle Ages by [[Martianus Capella]] and systematized during the Renaissance by [[Petrus Ramus]]. Capella's original goal was to provide a systematic, memorable framework to teach all human knowledge.  The term "classical education" has been used in Western culture for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics.  By the end of the 18th century, in addition to the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"&gt;{{citation

In the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been used to refer to a broad-based study of the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program.&lt;ref name="EncycAmerEd1"/&gt;

There exist a number of informal groups and professional organizations which undertake the classical approach to classical education in earnest.  Within the secular classical movement, in the 1930s [[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]] set forth the "Great Books" of Western civilization as center stage for a classical education curriculum.  Also some public schools (primarily charters) have structured their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom.  There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], and the CiRCE Institute.

The University of Pennsylvania seal (1894) depicted the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] as a stack of books providing the foundation for a 'modified' quadrivium of mathematics, natural philosophy (empirical science), astronomy, and theology.
__TOC__

==Three Phases of Modern Education Linked to Classical Education==
Classical education developed many of the terms now used to describe modern education.  Western classical education has three phases, each with a different purpose.  The phases are roughly coordinated with [[developmental psychology|human development]], and would ideally be exactly coordinated with each individual student's development.

* "Primary education" teaches students how to learn.
* "Secondary education" then teaches a conceptual framework that can hold all human knowledge (history), fills in basic facts and practices of major fields of knowledge, and develops the fundamental skills (perhaps in a simplified form) of every major human activity.
* "Tertiary education" then prepares a person to pursue an educated profession such as law, theology, military strategy, medicine, or science.

=== Primary education ===
In classical terms, primary education was the ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' comprising grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

Logic and rhetoric were often taught in part by the [[Socratic method]], in which the teacher raises questions and the class discusses them.  By controlling the pace, the teacher can keep the class very lively, yet disciplined.

==== Grammar ====
Grammar consists of [[language]] skills such as reading and the mechanics of writing.  An important goal of grammar is to acquire as many words and manage as many concepts as possible so as to be able to express and understand clearly concepts of varying degrees of complexity.  Classical education traditionally included study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] to reinforce understanding the workings of languages and allow students to read the [[Classics]] of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]] untranslated.  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this period refers to the upper elementary school years.

==== Logic ====
[[Logic]] ([[dialectic]]) is the process of correct [[reasoning]].  The traditional text for teaching logic was [[Aristotle]]'s [[Aristotelian logic|Logic]].  In the modern renaissance of classical education, this logic stage (or dialectic stage) refers to the junior high or middle school aged student, who developmentally is beginning to question ideas and authority, and truly enjoys a debate or an argument.  Training in logic, both formal and informal, enables students to critically examine arguments and to analyze their own. The whole goal is to train the student's mind not only to grasp information, but to find the analytical connections between seemingly different facts/ideas, to find out why something is true, or why something else is false (in short, reasons for a fact).

==== Rhetoric ====
[[Rhetoric]]al debate and composition are taught to somewhat older (often high school aged) students, who by this point in their education have the concepts and logic to criticize their own work and persuade others.  According to [[Aristotle]] "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic", concerned with finding "all the available means of persuasion."  The student now learns to articulate answers to important questions in his/her own words, to try to persuade others with these facts, and to defend ideas against rebuttal.  The student learns to reason correctly in the Logic stage so that they can now apply those skills to Rhetoric.  Traditionally, students would read and emulate classical poets in learning how to present their arguments well.

=== Secondary education ===
Secondary education, classically the ''[[quadrivium]]'' or "four ways," consist of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]].  Arithmetic is Number in itself, which is a pure abstraction; that is, outside of space and time.  Geometry is Number in space. Music is Number in time, and Astronomy is Number in space and time.&lt;ref name=EncycAmerEd1 /&gt;  Sometimes [[architecture]] was taught alongside these, often from the works of [[Vitruvius]].

History was always taught to provide a context and show political and military development.  The classic texts were from ancient authors such as [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Tacitus]].

Biographies were often assigned as well; the classic example being [[Plutarch]]'s ''Lives''.  Biographies help show how persons behave in their context, and the wide ranges of professions and options that exist.  As more modern texts became available, these were often added to the curriculum.

In the [[Middle Ages]], these were the best available texts.  In modern terms, these fields might be called [[history]], natural [[science]], [[accounting]] and [[business]], [[fine art]]s (at least two, one to amuse companions, and another to decorate one's domicile), [[military strategy]] and [[military tactics|tactics]], [[engineering]], [[agronomy]], and [[architecture]].

These are taught in a matrix of history, reviewing the natural development of each field for each phase of the trivium.  That is, in a perfect classical education, the historical study is reviewed three times: first to learn the grammar (the concepts, terms and skills in the order developed), next time the logic (how these elements could be assembled), and finally the rhetoric, how to produce good, humanly useful and beautiful objects that satisfy the grammar and logic of the field.

History is the unifying conceptual framework, because history is the study of everything that has occurred before the present.  A skillful teacher also uses the historical context to show how each stage of development naturally poses questions and then how advances answer them, helping to understand human motives and activity in each field.  The question-answer approach is called the "dialectic method," and permits history to be taught Socratically as well.

Classical educators consider the [[Socrates|Socratic]] method to be the best technique for teaching critical thinking.  In-class discussion and critiques are essential in order for students to recognize and internalize critical thinking techniques.  This method is widely used to teach both [[philosophy]] and [[law]].  It is currently rare in other contexts.  Basically, the teacher referees the students' discussions, asks leading questions, and may refer to facts, but never gives a conclusion until at least one student reaches that conclusion.  The learning is most effective when the students compete strongly, even viciously in the argument, but always according to well-accepted rules of correct reasoning.  That is, [[fallacy|fallacies]] should not be allowed by the teacher.

By completing a project in each major field of human effort, the student can develop a personal preference for further education and professional training.

=== Tertiary education ===
Tertiary education was usually an [[apprentice]]ship to a person with the desired profession.  Most often, the understudy was called a "secretary" and had the duty of carrying on all the normal business of the "master." [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] were both widely taught as tertiary subjects in Universities, however.

The early biographies of nobles show probably the ultimate form of classical education: a tutor.  One early, much-emulated classic example is of this tutor system is of [[Alexander the Great]], who was tutored by [[Aristotle]].

== Modern interpretations of classical education ==
There exist a number of modern groups and professional organizations which take the classical approach to education seriously, and who undertake it in earnest.

===Classical Christian education===
{{main|Classical Christian education}}
There are several major societies and associations within the [[classical Christian education]] movement, including the Society for Classical Learning, the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]], [http://trinityschools.org/ Trinity Schools], the [[Classic Learning Test]], and the CiRCE Institute. 

These schools tend to rely for upon one or more of the visions of classical education represented by [[Dorothy Sayers]] essay "The Lost Tools of Learning",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Sayers, Dorothy  |title=The Lost Tools of Learning |url=http://www.cambridgestudycenter.com/artilces/Sayers1.htm |date=presented at Oxford in 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer Adler's [[Paideia Proposal]], Alfred North Whitehead's ''The Aims of Education,'' or Susan Wise Bauer's ''[https://welltrainedmind.com/ The Well Trained Mind]''.

Most classical Christian schools employ the trivium as three stages of learning which are linked to child development:

* Grammar: The fundamental rules of each subject
* Logic: The ordered relationship of particulars in each subject 
* Rhetoric: How the grammar and logic of each subject may be clearly expressed 

Classical Christian schools vary in their approach to the sectarian integration of Christian thinking. Some schools ask parents to sign a statement of faith before attending, some do not require this of parents but are clear in their sectarian teaching, others are consciously ecumenical. In the 1970s, as a response to the campus riots and sexual revolution of the 1960s, many small classical Catholic colleges began to incorporate, e.g. the [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts]] in Merrimack, [[New Hampshire]] (est. 1978), [[Thomas Aquinas College]] in Sao Paulo, California, and [[Christendom College]] in Front Royal, Virginia. 

===Classical secular education===
There exist a number of classical schools in the public/secular sector.  These schools, primarily charter schools, also structure their curricula and pedagogy around the trivium and integrate the teaching of values (sometimes called "character education") into the mainstream classroom without involving any particular religious perspectives.

Methods of classical education have also often been integrated into [[homeschooling]], particularly due to the publication of:
"The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home," by Jessie Wise and [[Susan Wise Bauer]] (W.W. Norton, 1999), is a modern reference on classical education, particularly in a homeschool setting. It provides a history of classical education, an overview of the methodology and philosophy of classical education, and annotated lists of books divided by grade and topic that list the best books for classical education in each category.

[[Mortimer Adler]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], both of the [[University of Chicago]] set forth in the 1930s to restore the "Great Books" of Western civilization to center stage in the curriculum. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] is an example of this type of classical education at the college level.  Although the standard classical works&amp;mdash;such as the [[Harvard Classics]]&amp;mdash;most widely available at the time, were decried by many as out of touch with modern times, Adler and Hutchins sought to expand on the standard "classics" by including more modern works, and by trying to tie them together in the context of what they described as the "Great Ideas," condensed into a "Syntopicon" index and bundled together with a new "five foot shelf" of books as "The [[Great Books of the Western World]]." They were wildly popular during the 1950s, and discussion groups of aficionados were found all over the USA, but their popularity waned during the 1960s, and such groups are relatively hard to find today.  Extensions to the original set are still being published, encompassing selections from both current and older works which extend the "great ideas" into the present age and other fields, including civil rights, the global environment, and discussions of multiculturalism and assimilation.

==Classical Languages==
A more traditional, but less common view of classical education arises from the ideology of the Renaissance, advocating an education grounded in the languages and literatures of Greece and Rome. The demanding and lengthy training period required for learning to read Greek and Latin texts in their original form has been crowded out in most American schools in favor of more contemporary subjects.

The revival of "Classical Education" has resulted in Latin being taught at Classical Schools, but less often Greek.  It is worth noting that the [[Association of Classical and Christian Schools]] does require Latin for accreditation, and [[New Saint Andrews College]] requires both Latin and Greek to graduate with a 4-year degree.  A new group of schools, the [http://www.classicallatin.org Classical Latin School Association], does require Latin to be taught as a core subject.

Such an approach—an education in the [[classics]]—differs from the usual approach of the Classical education movement, but is akin to an education on "The Great Books" followed by [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]].

==Parallels in the East==
In India, the classical education system is based upon the study and understanding of the ancient texts the [[Vedas]], a discipline called [[Vedanga]], and subjects based upon that foundation, referred to as [[Upaveda]] and incorporating medicine ([[Ayurveda]]), music, [[archery]] and other [[martial arts]].

Similarly, in China, the fulcrum of a classical education was the study and understanding of a core canon, the [[Four Books and Five Classics]].

In Taiwan, Classical Chinese takes up 35% of Chinese education in junior high school (7-9th grade, compulsory), and 65% in senior high school (10-12th grade).

In it, he argues that the scope of the classical [[liberal education]] is inadequate for today's society, and that people should also be conversant with the basic facts of science and technology, since they now form a much more important part of our lives than did the tertiary studies of antiquity. He argues for a new synthesis of science, engineering, and the humanities in which there is a balance between what ''can'' be done and what ''ought'' to be done, between human desires and earthly consequences, and between our ever-increasing power to affect our surroundings and the ever-present danger of destroying the ecological and environmental systems which allow us to exist.

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e125 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17069454 |pmc=1626147 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; read the scientific literature and manually curate four types of core data:

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of technology''' is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and [[Digital technology|digital]] technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|last=Lorenzano|first=Pablo|authorlink2=Hans-Jörg Rheinberger|last2=Rheinberger|first2=Hans-Jörg|last3=Ortiz|first3=Eduardo|last4=Galles|first4=Carlos|publisher=EOLSS Publishers Co. Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781848267763|location=Oxford|pages=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by critics includes everyday household products, such as [[Refrigerator|refrigerators]], [[Home computer|computers]], and [[medication]].&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Günther Anders]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Mike Cooley (engineer) | Mike Cooley]] and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Some authors such as [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] consider themselves [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of "how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php/|title=Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism|last=Watson|first=Sara|date=October 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jacques Ellul and the Technological Society in the 21st Century|last=Jeronimo|first=Helena|last2=Garcia|first2=Jose|last3=Mitcham|first3=Carl|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789400766570|location=Dordrecht|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define [[Hierarchy|social hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age|last=Enos|first=Theresa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=0824072006|location=New York|pages=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist [[Naomi Klein]] described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a "shock doctrine", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists who also cite the cases of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crises]] as well as the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters to support their critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology - through [[robotics]], [[automation]], and [[software]] - is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/|title=How Technology Is Destroying Jobs|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called [[anarcho-primitivism]], which was forwarded by thinkers such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[John Zerzan]], and [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], the [[Situationist International]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and others.

The critique of technology overlaps with the [[philosophy of technology]] but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to [[academia]]. It features prominently in [[neomarxism|neo-Marxist]] ([[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Andrew Feenberg]]), [[ecofeminism]] ([[Vandana Shiva]]) and in [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] ([[Ivan Illich]])

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

[[File:De Re Aedificatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Title page of 1550 edition, [[Florence]]]]

'''''De re aedificatoria''''' ('''''On the Art of Building''''') is a classic architectural treatise written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1443 and 1452.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Grayson, in ''Kunstkronik'' '''213''' (1960:359ff, and ''Münchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst'' '''11''' (1960), demonstrated that the bulk of the composition was carried out between these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', it was the first theoretical book on the subject written in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and in 1485 it became the first printed book on architecture.  It was followed in 1486 with the first printed edition of Vitruvius.

{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art}}

Alberti's ''Ten Books'' consciously echoes Vitruvius's writing, but Alberti also adopts a critical attitude toward his predecessor. In his discussion, Alberti includes a wide variety of literary sources, including [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], presenting a concise version of the [[sociology]] of [[architecture]]. ''De re aedificatoria'' is subdivided into ten books and includes:

* Book One: ''Lineaments''
* Book Two: ''Materials''
* Book Three: ''Construction''
* Book Four: ''Public Works''
* Book Five: ''Works of Individuals''
* Book Six: ''Ornament''
* Book Seven: ''Ornament to Sacred Buildings''
* Book Eight: ''Ornament to Public Secular Buildings''
* Book Nine: ''Ornament to Private Buildings''
* Book Ten: ''Restoration of Buildings''

In his survey of desirable floor plans for sacred buildings— "temples" in his phrase—Alberti begins with the ideal form of the circle, which is expressed in numerous examples of Nature. Nine ideal centrally-planned geometrical shapes are recommended for churches; besides the circle he lists the square, the hexagon, octagon, decagon and dodecagon, all derived from the circle, and, derived from the square, rectangles that exhibit the square and a half, square and a third and double square, all of which have enharmonic parallels in music. Chapels add  small geometric figures to the basic circles and polygons to give a great variety of floor plans, in which each geometrical figure retains its clear unity and simple ratios that bind all elements of the plans and elevations into a harmonic unity.

''De re aedificatoria'' remained the classic treatise on architecture from the 16th until the 18th century.

The '''Department of Musicology''' is an institute of [[Palacký University]] [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], which conducts research and provides education in the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Fine art#Academic study|fine art]]. While the Faculty of Philosophy dates back to 1576 and has provided education for a number of [[Aesthetics|art theorists]], the separate Department of Musicology was established in 1946. It is sited in the building of University Art Centre (former Jesuit College), together with other two art departments of Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]].

==History==
Established in 1573, the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]] has a long history of musical scholarship. Olomouc prominently excels in the sphere of [[classical music]] ([[Jacobus Gallus|J. H. Gallus]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W. A. Mozart]], [[Antonín Dvořák|A. Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|G. Mahler]], [[Jan Kubelík|J. Kubelík]], [[Ema Destinová|E. Destinová]], who all spent some part of their lives in Olomouc). Among the Olomouc University graduates are both [[Aesthetics|art theorists]] ([[Karel Slavíček]], [[Raphael Georg Kiesewetter]], [[Rudolf Eitelberger]], etc.) as well as composers ([[Pavel Vranický]], [[Pavel Křížkovský]], [[Eduard Schön]], [[Emil Viklický]], etc.).

The modern tradition of musicological research and education goes back to 1946 when the ''Institute of Music Education and Science'' was established at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] by [[Robert Smetana]] (1904–1988). 1960’s &amp; 70’s saw a strong growth of the department (since 1972 led by [[Vladimír Hudec]]; however, the institute was  transformed into the ''Department of Music Education'' and transferred to the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]] in 1980 by the decision of the Ministry of Education.

Soon after the [[Velvet revolution|fall of the communist régime]] in 1989, the [[musicology]] returned to the ground of Philosophical Faculty, this time as part of the ''Department of Combined Art Studies''. Independent '''Department of Musicology''' was renewed in 1992 and through the enthusiasm of excellent professionals grew into a modern academic institution. Since 2002 it is sited in the ''University Art Centre'', former Jesuit College building, together with another two art departments of the Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of the Faculty of Education.

==Current Research Objectives &amp; Other Activities==
Research has a fundamental role for the Department. The Department hosts the annual ''International Musicological Conference'' (usually late November) and regular public workshops and seminars which are enriched by occasional activities such as conference on ''Zdeněk Fibich - the 19th Century Middle European Composer'' held in spring 2010.

The Department’s activities embrace a wide variety of modes of research (Regional and [[History|Historical Studies]], [[Organology]], [[Critical Edition of Musical Sources]], [[Jazz]], [[Art Rock]], [[Film Music]], and so on). Department’s research is  supported by a major funds from the [[European Union]] and [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Czech Government]] (principal among these are the ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1890-1905'', ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1906-1949'', ''Zdeněk Fibich’s 19th century Operas'', ''Moravia and the World'' ...). Department participated on ''Music Media Training Programme For the Czech Republic (1995 - 1998)'' and ''Musical Life in Europe (1997 - 2001)''. Since 1997 the Department is linked to [[Saint Cloud State University]] through the ''Art and Music in the Czech Republic Programme''.

The Department also benefits from a number of collaborative research and educational partnerships, including those with

During last decades the Department provided a forum for a number of academics and visiting lecturers (i.e. [[Charles Ansbacher]], Michael Beckerman, [[Greg Hurworth]], [[Thomas Christensen (professor)|Thomas Christensen]], [[Jobst Fricke]], [[Kenton Frohrip]], [[David Benjamin Levy]], [[Graham Melville-Mason]], [[Scott L. Miller]], [[Christopher Shultis]] and others).

As part of the University's [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], the Department of Musicology offers [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Ph.D.|Doctoral]] degrees in the fields of [[Musicology]] and [[Arts integration]].

The Department holds regular concerts and musical festival as well (i.e. festival of contemporary music MusicOlomouc).

===Former Staff and Graduates===
During its history department possessed a rather unusual roster of musicologists whose interest covered a great variety of scientific issues (namely [[Robert Smetana]], [[Vladimír Hudec]], [[Vladimír Gregor]], [[František Kratochvíl]], [[Libor Melkus]], [[Gustav Pivoňka]], [[Josef Schreiber (musicologist)]], [[Luděk Zenkl]], [[Pavel Čotek]], [[Ivan Poledňák]], [[Mikuláš Bek]], [[Miroslav K. Černý]], [[Jiří Fukač]], [[Jaroslav Jiránek]], [[Václav Kučera]], [[Stanislav Tesař]], [[Vladimír Tichý]], [[Jiří Sehnal]], [[Miloš Štědroň]], [[Vlastislav Matoušek]]). Many graduates have become leading scholars and prominent musicians ([[Leo Jehne]], [[Michal Chrobák]], [[Jan Kapusta]], [[Pavel Klapil]], [[Jiří Pavlica]], [[Stanislav Pecháček]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">{{jargon|date=March 2017}}'''Digital morphogenesis''' is a type of generative art in which complex shape development, or [[morphogenesis]], is enabled by computation. This concept is applicable in many areas of design, art, architecture, and modeling.  The concept was originally developed in the field of [[biology]], later in [[geology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[architecture]].  

In [[architecture]], it describes tools and methods for creating forms and adapting them to a known environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko (2000). 'Digital Morphogenesis and Computational Architectures', in ''Proceedings of the 4th Conference of Congreso Iberoamericano de Grafica Digital, SIGRADI 2000 - Construindo (n)o Espaço Digital (Constructing the Digital Space)'', Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 25–28 September 2000, ed. by José Ripper Kós, Andréa Pessoa Borde and Diana Rodriguez Barros, pp. 98-103 [http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/4077.content.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko and [[Ali Malkawi]], eds (2005). ''Performative Architecture: Beyond Instrumentality'' (New York; London: Spon Press), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Neil (2009). 'Digital Morphogenesis', ''Architectural Design'', 79, 1, pp. 32-37
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roudavski"&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009). 'Towards Morphogenesis in Architecture', ''International Journal of Architectural Computing'', 7, 3, pp. 345-374, p. 348 [https://www.academia.edu/208933/Towards_Morphogenesis_in_Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanislav Roudavski describes it as similar to biological morphogenesis: developing gradually, without an explicit definition of the methods of growth or adaptation.  Parallels can be seen in [[emergence|emergent properties]] and [[self-organization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009), pp. 348, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms.  As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.

'''ECOWEEK''' ''Εβδομάδα Οικολογίας'' (Greek) is a private non-profit, non-governmental international organization aiming towards the empowerment, networking, education and training of young professionals - architects, designers, engineers, landscape architects - towards sustainable urban and public interventions and facilitation of action through fieldwork, workshops, education and training and through cooperation with local authorities, organizations and leaders.

== Mission ==
ECOWEEK mission is to raise environmental awareness and awareness on [[climate change]] and to promote the principles of [[sustainability]].

== History ==
ECOWEEK was initially established in Aegina, Greece in 2005. It was initially conceived as a community event - ''Ecological Week in Aegina'' - to raise environmental awareness of the local community of 14,000. At the time Aegina was challenged by unresolved waste management,&lt;ref&gt;Ζουμπουλάκης, Γ. (7-08-2005). ''Χωρίς νερό αλλά με σκουπίδια - Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ - http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=167683&lt;/ref&gt; illegal burning of waste, inexistant waste recycling program, water shortages,&lt;ref&gt;Χριστοδουλίδου, Π. (9-08-2005). ''Άρχισε ξανά η μεταφορά νερού στην Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=11058&lt;/ref&gt; energy shortages, and a thriving and partially unregulated spec construction market for summer houses, which although contributed to the local economy, it put pressure in protected areas to be developed and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, Thracy. (1-06-2007). ''Concrete plans unsettled''. ATHENS NEWS - http://www.aeginagreece.com/main/aegina_eco/cementfactory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Construction also contributed in increasing illegal disposal of construction waste in natural reserves, and the increase of the summer population thus bringing the capacity of the existing infrastructures of the island to its limits.

Ecological Week in Aegina was held in Aegina for 2 years. In 2007, responding to an increase demand for environmental awareness beyond Aegina, ECOWEEK co-organized activity throughout Greece, and initiated free-admission screenings of award-winning documentary on Climate Change by Davis Guggenheim ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' with [[Al Gore]] in schools, the army, and public screenings in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Lamia, Corfu, and Crete. Within this activity, in June 2007, ECOWEEK held a public free-admission keynote lecture and slide show on Climate Change by inviting Al Gore&lt;ref&gt;Πολιτισμός. (22-5-2007). ''Ο Αλ Γκορ στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=110309&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Athens Concert Hall]]. In 2007 ECOWEEK was also established in Jerusalem, Israel and in 2008 ECOWEEK initiated the first Ecological Week in [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]], in cooperation with the Municipality of Larnaka], involving schools, universities, professional organizations, and the general public.

== Programs ==
Since 2005, ECOWEEK developed its outreach activity towards raising awareness to a variety of population groups, age-groups and interests. For example, from children activity, cleaning of beaches, lottery of composters and solar chargers, to academic and colloquial lectures, site visits, design workshops, and film screenings.
Since 2008, ECOWEEK activity focuses more on sustainable design and ecological building, social design,and [[placemaking]]. Its activity involved primarily one-week-long design workshops and international conferences for young and established professionals - primarily architects, designers, landscape architects and engineers. ECOWEEK has developed and expanded its activity through close collaboration with cultural institutions, such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] Continental Europe, the [[British Council]], [[Goethe Institute]], academic institutions, municipalities and governments. ECOWEEK has initiated and organized activities in [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]] ([[Crete]]), [[Athens]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Azaryia]] ([[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]), [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Cairns]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kraków]], [[London]], [[Milan]]o, [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Tilburg]], [[Pristina|Prishtina]], and [[Rome]].

In 2017 ECOWEEK published its first book titled [http://ecoweekbook.org/ ECOWEEK Book#1: 50 Voices for Sustainability], featuring fifty articles by leading architects,designers, professionals, academics and environmentalists from around the world. Among them award-winning architects [[Kengo Kuma]], [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG]], [[MVRDV]], [[Françoise-Hélène Jourda|Francoise-Helene Jourda]], [[Diébédo Francis Kéré|Diebedo Francis Kere]], [[Michael Sorkin]], Prof. David Orr and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Swan]]. The same year ECOWEEK also issued [https://issuu.com/ecoweek/docs/ecoweek_catalogue_2016 ECOWEEK: The Workshops] a publication with a collection of ideas and projects from the ECOWEEK workshops (2009-2016).

== Hassan Fathy ==
In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder architect Elias Messinas met the late Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] - author of [[Architecture for the Poor]] - in [[Cairo]]. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them housing for the poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of their own community and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with their work their own community.

Inspired by Fathy, ECOWEEK workshops have gradually developed a more hands-on approach that links between acedemia and the community, and between professionals and students since 2010. Aiming to both empower and train young professionals to address urban public space, placemaking, urban communities through interventions in design and hands-on workshops in urban public context, ECOWEEK and its partners have developed a model of close collaboration with local authorities, local organizations and leaders. Through this collaboration, the ECOWEEK workshops are assigned projects that are real, support them with professional consultants and see that some of the projects are implemented. Students' ideas are heard and cities, neighborhoods and communities benefit from the innovative and creative ideas of students and the professional guidance of the workshop leaders. The ECOWEEK workshops have developed sustainable proposals for ''Copenhagen,&lt;ref&gt;Oxgren, Dorthe. (15-05-2013).'' Studerende skal gore Nordvest gronnere.

== The GREENHOUSE ==
[[File:Ecoweek greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aiming to establish a permanent platform and not just one-week-long activity, ECOWEEK established the GREENHOUSE in 2011 in Athens, Greece. The GREENHOUSE is a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship for society and the environment, engaging young architects, designers, landscape architects and students in real design assignments for real non-profit organizations and local authorities. The GREENHOUSE teams, under the guidance of experienced professionals, have developed sustainable solutions for schools, community centers, [https://ecoweekorg.wixsite.com/ghath2017 welfare institutions] and the urban public space in Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and Holon,&lt;ref&gt;(20-05-2013).

==Methodology and hypotheses==
===Issues with research===
Within the field of pornography research, there are many challenges that arise due to strong opinions and feelings on the topic. [[Confirmation bias]] is prevalent due to societal taboos surrounding pornography. While many studies hypothesize about and study negative effects of pornography, few researchers explore potential benefits or positive aspects of pornography. A large percentage of studies suffer from [[methodological]] issues. In one meta-study by researchers at Middlesex University in England, over 40,000 papers and articles were submitted to the team for review and 276 or 0.69% were suitable for consideration due to the low quality of research within the field.&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22987051|title=Do we know whether pornography harms people?|last=Fidgen|first=Jo|date=2013-06-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zillmann's research===
[[File:Zillmann Fig 5.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/ |last=Zillmann |first=Dolf |title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography |website=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;]][[File:Zillmann Fig 10.png|thumb|300px|Figure 10 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt;]]

In ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography'', a review of pornography research conducted for the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] in 1986, Zillmann noted that inconsistencies in the literature on pornography exist, but overall concluded that extensive viewing of pornographic material may produce some [[sociology|sociological]] effects he argued were negative, including a decreased respect for long-term, [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships, and an attenuated desire for [[reproduction|procreation]].&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt; He describes the hypothetical basis for these conclusions stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children ... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again ... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs ...&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other contemporary researchers disagreed, McKay &amp; Dolf noting "neglected in work on pornography is that adults capable of functioning in contemporary society are also quite able to distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy. That such a point requires stating is indicative of the overly simplistic model of human behaviour which is reflected in this type of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKay|first1=H.B.|last2=Dolff|first2=D.J|title='The Impact of Pornography: An Analysis of Research and Summary of Findings';  Working Papers on Pornography and Prostitution Report No. 3|date=1984|publisher=Department of Justice, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects as [[Gail Dines]] summarizes Zillman's 1989 study, include "alters perceptions of sexuality; specifically, it fosters presumptions of popularity for less common sexual practices; breeds discontent with the physical appearance and the sexual performance of intimate partners; trivializes rape as a criminal offense and also trivializes sexual child abuse as a criminal offense; and promotes insensitivity toward victims of sexual violence and promotes men's beliefs that they would be capable of committing rape. In addition, habitual male consumers of common pornography appear to be at greater risk of becoming sexually callous and sexually violent toward women than occasional users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dines|first1=Gail|title=Pornland : how porn has hijacked our sexuality|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0807044520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bryant|editor-first1=D. Zillmann, J.|title=Pornography : research advances and policy considerations|date=1989|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale (New Jersey)|isbn=0805806156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avedon Carol]] has explained of Zillmann's term "sexually callous" that he meant "a greater tolerance for homosexuality; a belief that women should be able to choose other priorities beside motherhood; less belief in marriage; a belief that women may enjoy sex and choose to participate in it for reasons other than pleasing their husbands or conceiving children - in short, the goals of most feminist groups of the time. Zillmann was unable to demonstrate any increase in misogynist or violent attitudes and desires, although he did try." and stated of the sponsor of the report "Having noted the varied interpretability of Zillmann and Bryant's findings, the [USA] Surgeon-General's report said that the only reliable findings of the research that supposedly proved men were more callous towards women after looking at pornography was this: the group that saw pornography estimated more accurately the prevalence of sexual practices in society. The control group, which did not see the material, tended to underestimate grossly how common certain sexual acts were" and commented "But even this result may be less reliable than it appears, due to methodological problems. Zillmann and Bryant had tried to include non-students in their research, but many of them left the study group when they discovered they would be asked to look at pornography. This meant that the control group contained a different population - older, perhaps more settled married men, for example - and thus any differences in the answers the groups gave to the questions might only reflect different attitudes among the different groups, and not pornography effects at all. The study was no longer controlled. In the end, the research may only mean that older, married men are less critical of their partners than young, single psychology students, and that such young, educated men have more liberal attitudes about women's roles and homosexuality, and more realistic knowledge of sexual practices in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carol|first1=Avedon|title=Nudes, Prudes and Attitudes: Pornography and Censorship|date=1994|publisher=New Clarion Press|location=Gloucester|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addiction==
[[Pornography addiction]] is a purported [[behavioral addiction]] characterized by [[compulsive]], repeated use of pornographic material until it causes serious negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SteinHollander2009"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dan J. |last1=Stein |first2=Eric |last2=Hollander |first3=Barbara Olasov |last3=Rothbaum |title=Textbook of Anxiety Disorders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quQY1R8vsZcC&amp;pg=PA359 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |date=31 August 2009 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-1-58562-254-2|pages=359–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17503551"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parashar A, Varma A |title=Behavior and substance addictions: is the world ready for a new category in the DSM-V? |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=257; author reply 258–9 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17503551 |doi= |url=http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no diagnosis of pornography addiction in the current ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]).&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt; The DSM-5 considered the diagnosis of hypersexuality-related behavioral disorders (to which porn addiction was a subset), but rejected it because "there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders."&lt;ref name="dsm-5"&gt;{{Cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|pages=481, 797–798|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|quote=Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, some psychologists suggest that any [[maladaptive]] sexual symptoms represent a manifestation of an underlying disorder, such as depression or anxiety which is simply manifesting itself sexually, or, alternatively, there is no underlying disorder and the behavior simply is not maladaptive. These psychologists do not recognize the concept of addiction, only chemical dependence, and believe the concept and diagnosis to be stigmatizing and unhelpful.&lt;ref&gt;The British Psychological Society, "Response to the American Psychiatric Association: DSM-5 Development", 2001 [http://apps.bps.org.uk/_publicationfiles/consultation-responses/DSM-5%202011%20-%20BPS%20response.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBQ8G56X7YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Myth+of+addiction+ley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU7sqG85nPAhVU2WMKHUMBB_cQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Myth%2520of%2520addiction%2520ley&amp;f=false|title=The Myth of Sex Addiction|last=Ley|first=David J.|date=2014-07-10|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442213050|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 2016 neurology reviews found evidence of addiction related brain changes in internet pornography users.

===Controlled studies===
{{See also|Correlation does not imply causation}}
A controlled study describes the relationship between given behaviors or environmental conditions and health effects in a laboratory setting in which conditions other than those under study are effectively held constant across groups of participants receiving various levels of the experimental condition(s).  Since it is considered that the only functional difference between groups is the level of experimental condition(s) received, researchers can strongly infer cause-and-effect relationships from [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] associations between experimental condition(s) and health consequences.  Thus, if executed properly, controlled studies have high levels of [[internal validity]].  However, such studies often suffer from questionable [[external validity]] due to the considerable differences between real-world environments and the experimental context, and the consequent belief that results cannot be generalized beyond that context.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks/&gt;

The link between pornography and sexual aggression has been the subject of multiple [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]].&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/00arsr11.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pornography and Attitudes Supporting Violence Against Women: Revisiting the Relationship in Nonexperimental Studies |first=Gert Martin |last=Hald |first2=Neil |last2=Malamuth |first3=Carlin |last3=Yuen |year=2000 |website=UCLA Division of Social Sciences |accessdate=13 March 2013}}

A meta-analysis conducted in 2015 found that pornography "consumption was associated with sexual aggression in the United States and internationally, among males and females, and in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Associations were stronger for verbal than physical sexual aggression, although both were significant. The general pattern of results suggested that violent content may be an exacerbating factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Meta-Analysis of Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression in General Population Studies|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12201/abstract|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 183–205|doi = 10.1111/jcom.12201|language = en|first = Paul J.|last = Wright|first2 = Robert S.|last2 = Tokunaga|first3 = Ashley|last3 = Kraus|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=July 2016}}

In an earlier review of this literature Ferguson and Hartley (2009) argued that "it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior".&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"&gt;{{citation |last=Ferguson|first=Christopher J.|title=The pleasure is momentary...the expense damnable?  The influence of pornography on rape and sexual assault.|url=http://www.christopherjferguson.com/pornography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the authors of some studies tended to highlight positive findings while deemphasizing null findings, demonstrating confirmation bias in the published literature.  Ferguson and Hartley concluded that controlled studies, on balance, were not able to support links between pornography and sexual violence.

===Epidemiological studies===
An [[epidemiological]] study describes the association between given behaviors or environmental conditions, and physical or psychological health by means of observation of real-world phenomena through statistical data.  Epidemiological studies generally have high levels of [[external validity]], insofar as they accurately describe events as they occur outside of a laboratory setting, but low levels of [[internal validity]], since they do not strongly establish cause-and-effect relationships between the behaviors or conditions under study, and the health consequences observed.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks&gt;*Mitchell, M. and Jolley, J.

Danish criminologist [[Berl Kutchinsky]]'s ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'' (1970), a scientific report ordered by the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, found that the legalizing of pornography in [[Denmark]] had not resulted in an increase of [[sex crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html [[Berl Kutchinsky]]: ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030030642/http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, many other experiments have been conducted, either supporting or opposing the findings of [[Berl Kutchinsky]], who would continue his study into the social effects of pornography until his death in 1995. His life's work was summed up in the publication ''Law, Pornography, and Crime: The Danish Experience'' (1999). Milton Diamond from the [[University of Hawaii]] found that the number of reported cases of child sex abuse dropped markedly immediately after the ban on sexually explicit materials was lifted in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm The Effects of Pornography: An International Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203171037/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm |date=2012-02-03 }} [[University of Hawaii]] Porn 101: Eroticism, Pornography, and the First Amendment: Milton Diamond Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, a review of epidemiological studies by Neil M. Malamuth found that the quantity of pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with degree to which they endorsed sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Malamuth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malamuth|first=Neil M.|title=Do Sexually Violent Media Indirectly Contribute to Antisocial Behavior?|publisher=Public Health Service of United States|date=August 4, 1986|pages=38|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malamuth's work describes Check (1984), who found among a diverse sample of [[Canadians|Canadian]] men that more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of [[rape myth]]s, violence against women, and general sexual callousness. In another study, Briere, Corne, Runtz and Neil M. Malamuth, (1984) reported similar correlations in a sample involving college males. On the other hand, the failure to find a statistically significant correlation in another previous study led Malamuth to examine other interesting correlations, which took into account the information about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] the samples obtained in their childhood, and pornography emerged as the second most important source of information.&lt;ref name="Malamuth" /&gt;  Malamuth's work has been criticized by other authors, however, such as Ferguson and Hartley (2009) who argue Malamuth has exaggerated positive findings and has not always properly discussed null findings.&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"/&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California’s Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health’s Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental engineering science''' ('''EES''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] field of [[engineering science]] that combines the [[biological]], [[chemical]] and physical sciences with the field of engineering.  This major traditionally requires the student to take basic engineering classes in fields such as [[thermodynamics]], advanced [[math]], computer modeling and [[simulation]] and technical classes in subjects such as [[statics]], [[mechanics]], [[hydrology]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. As the student progresses, the upper division elective classes define a specific field of study for the student with a choice in a [[Environmental Engineering Science#Electives|range]] of science, technology and engineering related classes.&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

==Difference with related fields==
[[Image:CalifAcadSciRoof 0820.JPG|thumb|right|Graduates of Environmental Engineering Science can go on to work on the technical aspects of designing a [[Green roof|Living Roof]] like the one pictured here at the [[California Academy of Science|California Academy of the Sciences]]]]
As a recently created program, environmental engineering science has not yet been incorporated into the terminology found among [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] focused professionals.  In the few engineering colleges that offer this major, the curriculum shares more classes in common with [[environmental engineering]] than it does with [[environmental science]].  Typically, EES students follow a similar course curriculum with environmental engineers until their fields diverge during the last year of college.  The majority of the environmental engineering students must take classes designed to connect their knowledge of the environment to modern [[building materials]] and [[construction]] methods.  This is meant to direct the environmental engineer into a field where they will more than likely assist in building [[wastewater treatment|treatment facilities]], preparing [[environmental impact assessment]]s or helping to mitigate [[air pollution]] from specific point sources.

Meanwhile, the environmental engineering science student will choose a direction for their [[career]].  From the range of electives they have to choose from, these students can move into a fields such as the design of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear storage facilities]], bacterial [[bioreactors]] or [[environmental policies]]. These students combine the practical design background of an engineer with the detailed theory found in many of the [[biology|biological]] and [[physical sciences]].

==Description at universities==
===Stanford University===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University provides the following description for their program in Environmental Engineering and Science:
The Environmental Engineering and Science (EES) program focuses on the chemical and biological processes involved in water quality engineering, water and air pollution, remediation and hazardous substance control, human exposure to pollutants, environmental biotechnology, and environmental protection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===UC Berkeley===
The College of Engineering at [[UC Berkeley]] defines Environmental Engineering Science, including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite news|pages=27–28 |title=Engineering Announcement 2008-2009 |url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203005457/http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a multidisciplinary field requiring an integration of physical, chemical and biological principles with engineering analysis for environmental protection and restoration. The program incorporates courses from many departments on campus to create a discipline that is rigorously based in science and engineering, while addressing a wide variety of environmental issues. Although an environmental engineering option exists within the civil engineering major, the engineering science curriculum provides a more broadly based foundation in the sciences than is possible in civil engineering
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===

At [[MIT]], the major is described in their curriculum, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIT Course Catalog: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. |url=http://web.mit.edu/catalogue/degre.engin.civil.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering Science emphasizes the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes necessary for understanding the interactions between man and the environment. Issues considered include the provision of clean and reliable water supplies, flood forecasting and protection, development of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, causes and implications of climate change, and the impact of human activities on natural cycles
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wet labs are required as part of the lower division curriculum]]

==Lower division coursework==

Lower division coursework in this field requires the student to take several laboratory-based classes in calculus-based physics, chemistry, biology, [[Mathematical programming|programming]] and [[analysis]].  This is intended to give the student background information in order to introduce them to the engineering fields and to prepare them for more technical information in their upper division coursework.

==Upper division coursework==
[[Image:FAE visualization.jpg|left|thumb|Students learn to integrate their math and statistics with software to perform analysis of physical [[systems]] like the [[Finite Element Analysis]] shown above]]
The upper division classes in Environmental Engineering Science prepares the student for work in the fields of engineering and science with coursework in subjects including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

*[[Fluid mechanics]]
*[[Mechanics]] of materials
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Environmental engineering]]
*Advanced math and [[statistics]]
*[[Geology]]
*[[Physical Chemistry|Physical]], [[Organic Chemistry|organic]] and [[atmospheric chemistry]]

==Post graduation work==

The multidisciplinary approach in Environmental Engineering Science gives the student expertise in technical fields related to their own personal interest.  While some graduates choose to use this major to go to graduate school,&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt; students who choose to work often go into the fields of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]], [[biotechnology]], and research.  However, the less technical math, programming and writing background gives the students opportunities to pursue [[information technology|IT]] work and [[technical writing]].

'''Environmental geology''', like [[hydrogeology]], is an applied science concerned with the practical application of the principles of geology in the solving of environmental problems. It is a multidisciplinary field that is closely related to [[engineering geology]] and, to a lesser extent, to [[environmental geography]]. Each of these fields involves the study of the interaction of humans with the [[geologic]] environment, including the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and to some extent the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. In other words, environmental geology is the application of geological information to solve conflicts, minimizing possible adverse [[environmental degradation]] or maximizing possible advantageous condition resulting from the use of natural and modified environment.
 
Environmental geology includes:

* managing geological and hydrogeological resources such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[water (molecule)|water]] (surface and [[ground water]]), and [[land use]]. 
* studying the earth's surface through the disciplines of [[geomorphology]], and [[edaphology]];
* defining and mitigating exposure of natural hazards on humans 
* managing industrial and domestic waste disposal and minimizing or eliminating effects of [[pollution]], and 
* performing associated activities, often involving litigation.

A peer-reviewed journal in the field is ''[[Environmental Earth Sciences]]'' ({{ISSN|1866-6280}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Environmental Earth Sciences | publisher = Springer | url = https://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/geology/journal/12665 | accessdate = 2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly ''Environmental Geology'' ({{ISSN|0943-0105}}).

'''Environmental health''' is the branch of [[public health]] concerned with all aspects of the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] affecting human health. Other terms referring to or concerning environmental health are '''environmental public health''', and '''public health protection/''' '''environmental health protection'''. Environmental health is focused on the natural and built environments for the benefit of human health, whereas [[environmental protection]] is concerned with protecting the natural environment for the benefit of human health and the ecosystem.

==Definitions==
Environmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as:
:Those aspects of the [[human health]] and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.

:Environmental health as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Novice| first = Robert (editor) | title = Overview of the environment and health in Europe in the 1990s| work = | publisher = World Health Organization| date =  1999-03-29| url = http://www.euro.who.int/document/e66792.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 the WHO website on environmental health states "Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Health topics: Environmental health| url = http://www.who.int/topics/environmental_health/en/|author=WHO|date=n.d.|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also defined environmental health services as "those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The term [[environmental medicine]] may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Environmental health profession==
Environmental health professionals may be known as [[environmental health officer]]s, public health inspectors, environmental health specialists, environmental health practitioners, or sanitarians. Researchers and policy-makers also play important roles in how environmental health is practiced in the field. In many European countries, physicians and veterinarians are involved in environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the [[United Kingdom]], practitioners must have a graduate degree in environmental health and be certified and registered with the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health or the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/environmentalhealthofficer.aspx |title=Job Profiles: Environmental health officer| publisher=National Careers Service (UK) |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, practitioners in environmental health are required to obtain an approved bachelor's degree in environmental health along with the national professional certificate, the Certificate in Public Health Inspection (Canada) [[CPHI(C)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciphi.ca |title=Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states in the [[United States]] also require that individuals have a bachelor's degree and professional [[license]]s in order to practice environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[California]] state law defines the scope of practice of environmental health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code, section 106615(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Scope of practice in environmental health" means the practice of environmental health by registered environmental health specialists in the public and private sector within the meaning of this article and includes, but is not limited to, organization, management, education, enforcement, consultation, and emergency response for the purpose of prevention of environmental health hazards and the promotion and protection of the public health and the environment in the following areas: food protection; housing; institutional environmental health; land use; community noise control; recreational swimming areas and waters; electromagnetic radiation control; solid, liquid, and hazardous materials management; underground storage tank control; onsite septic systems; vector control; drinking water quality; water sanitation; emergency preparedness; and milk and dairy sanitation pursuant to Section 33113 of the Food and Agricultural Code.

The environmental health [[profession]] had its modern-day roots in the sanitary and public health movement of the United Kingdom. This was epitomized by [[Edwin Chadwick|Sir Edwin Chadwick]], who was instrumental in the repeal of the [[poor law]]s, and in 1884 was the founding president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now called the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Disciplines ==

Five basic disciplines generally contribute to the field of environmental health: environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law. Each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health, but there is some overlap among them.
:*[[Environmental epidemiology]] studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Toxicology]] studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects. However there are many differences in animal and human biology, and there can be a lot of uncertainty when interpreting the results of [[animal studies]] for their implications for human health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Exposure science]] studies human exposure to environmental contaminants by both identifying and quantifying exposures. Exposure science can be used to support environmental epidemiology by better describing environmental exposures that may lead to a particular health outcome,identify common exposures whose health outcomes may be better understood through a toxicology study, or can be used in a risk assessment to determine whether current levels of exposure might exceed recommended levels. Exposure science has the advantage of being able to very accurately quantify exposures to specific chemicals, but it does not generate any information about health outcomes like environmental epidemiology or toxicology.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Environmental engineering]] applies scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and general improvement of environmental quality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
:*[[Environmental law]] includes the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Information from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science can be combined to conduct a [[risk assessment]] for specific chemicals, mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health (exposure would likely result in the development of [[List_of_pollution-related_diseases|pollution-related diseases]]). This can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that, for example, regulates chemical emissions, or imposes standards for proper [[sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTgSBW8jE8QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;f=false|title= Environmental Health: from Global to Local|edition=2 Editor= Howard Frumkin|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|location= San Francisco|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Actions of engineering and law can be combined to provide [[risk management]] to minimize, monitor, and otherwise manage the impact of exposure to protect human health to achieve the objectives of environmental health policy.

==Concerns==
{{prose|date=January 2015}}
Environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of the natural environment and the built environment. Environmental health concerns include:

* [[Air quality]], including both ambient outdoor air and [[indoor air quality]], which also comprises concerns about [[environmental tobacco smoke]].
* [[Biosafety]]
* [[Effects of climate change on human health|Climate change and its effects on health]].
* [[Disaster preparedness]] and response.
* [[Food safety]], including in [[agriculture]], [[transportation]], [[food processing]], [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] distribution and sale.
* [[Hazardous materials]] management, including [[hazardous waste]] management, contaminated site remediation, the prevention of leaks from [[underground storage tank]]s and the prevention of hazardous materials releases to the environment and responses to emergency situations resulting from such releases.
* [[House|Housing]], including [[substandard housing]] abatement and the inspection of [[jails]] and [[prisons]].
* Childhood [[lead poisoning]] prevention.
* [[Land use planning]], including [[smart growth]].
* Liquid waste disposal, including city [[waste water treatment]] plants and on-site waste water disposal systems, such as [[septic tank]] systems and [[chemical toilet]]s.
* [[Medical waste]] management and disposal.
* [[Noise pollution]] control.
* [[Occupational health]] and [[industrial hygiene]].
* Radiological health, including exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[X-rays]] or [[radioactive isotopes]].
* Recreational water illness prevention, including from [[swimming pools]], spas and [[ocean]] and [[freshwater]] bathing places.
* Safe [[drinking water]].
* [[Solid waste management]], including [[landfill]]s, [[recycling]] facilities, [[composting]] and solid waste transfer stations.
* [[Toxic]] chemical exposure whether in [[consumer products]], housing, workplaces, air, water or soil.
* [[Vector control]], including the control of [[mosquitoes]], [[rodents]], [[flies]], [[cockroach]]es and other animals that may transmit [[pathogens]].

According to recent estimates, about 5 to 10% of [[Disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) lost are due to environmental causes in Europe. By far the most important factor is fine [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] pollution in urban air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/nl/national-and-regional-story-netherlands-1 National and regional story (Netherlands) - Environmental burden of disease in Europe: the Abode project]. EEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, environmental exposures have been estimated to contribute to 4.9 million (8.7%) deaths and 86 million (5.7%) [[DALYs]] globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/9 Knows and unknowns on burden of disease due to chemicals: a systematic review]. Press-Ustinov, A., et al. 2011. Environmental Health 10:9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Superfund sites created by various companies have been found to be hazardous to human and environmental health in nearby communities. It was this perceived threat, raising the specter of miscarriages, mutations, birth defects, and cancers that most frightened the public.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, D. (1995). Superfund’s Abandoned Hazardous Waste Sites. In A. Wildavsky (Ed.), But Is it True?: A Citizen’s Guide to Environmental Health and Safety Issues (153-184) . Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html |title=TEHIP|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site, that includes open access to resources produced by US government agencies and organizations, and is maintained under the umbrella of the Specialized Information Service at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]. TEHIP includes links to technical databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and consumer-oriented resources. 
TEHIP is responsible for the [[Toxicology Data Network]] (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/|title=TOXNET|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases including the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]], that are open access, i.e. available free of charge.

==Mapping==

There are many environmental health mapping tools. [[TOXMAP]] is a geographic information system (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://sis.nlm.nih.gov sis.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US federal government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from the NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov toxnet.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

'''Feng shui''' or '''fengshui''' ({{lang-zh|t=風水|s=风水|first=t}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|Zh-feng1shui3.ogg|f|eng|1|.|sh|ui|3}}), also known as '''Chinese [[geomancy]]''', is a [[pseudoscience]] originating from China, which claims to use energy forces to harmonize individuals with their surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=matthews/&gt; The term ''feng shui'' literally translates as "wind-water" in English. This is a cultural shorthand taken from the passage of the now-lost ''[[Classic of Burial]]'' recorded in [[Guo Pu]]'s [[Book of Burial|commentary]]:&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web | last = Field | first = Stephen L. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''The Zangshu, or Book of Burial''. | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://fengshuigate.com/zangshu.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feng shui is one of the Five Arts of Chinese Metaphysics, classified as [[physiognomy]] (observation of appearances through formulas and calculations). The feng shui practice discusses architecture in terms of "invisible forces" that bind the universe, earth, and humanity together, known as ''[[qi]]''.

Historically, feng shui was widely used to orient buildings—often spiritually significant structures such as tombs, but also dwellings and other structures—in an [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] manner. Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, an auspicious site could be determined by reference to local features such as bodies of water, or stars or the compass.

==History==
===Origins===
{{As of | 2013}} the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Hongshan culture]]s provide the earliest known evidence for the use of feng shui. Until the invention of the [[magnetic compass]], feng shui apparently relied on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] to find correlations between humans and the universe.&lt;ref&gt;
Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423–54. Kluwer Academic.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In 4000 BC, the doors of [[Banpo]] dwellings aligned with the [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] ''Yingshi'' just after the [[winter solstice]]—this sited the homes for [[solar gain]].&lt;ref&gt;
David W. Pankenier. 'The Political Background of Heaven's Mandate.' ''Early China'' 20 (1995): 121-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] era, ''Yingshi'' was known as ''Ding'' and used to indicate the appropriate time to build a capital city, according to the ''[[Shijing]]''. The late Yangshao site at [[Dadiwan]] (c. 3500–3000 BC) includes a palace-like building (F901) at the center. The building faces south and borders a large plaza. It stands on a north-south axis with another building that apparently housed communal activities. Regional communities may have used the complex.&lt;ref&gt;Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grave at [[Puyang]] (around 4000 BC) that contains mosaics— actually a [[Chinese star map]] of the Dragon and Tiger asterisms and [[Big Dipper|Beidou]] ([[Dipper|the Big Dipper, Ladle or Bushel]])— is oriented along a north-south axis.&lt;ref&gt;Zhentao Xuastronomy. 2000: 2&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of both round and square shapes in the Puyang tomb, at Hongshan ceremonial centers and at the late Longshan settlement at Lutaigang,&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 248–249.
&lt;/ref&gt;
suggests that ''gaitian'' cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square) existed in Chinese society long before it appeared in the ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel. (2006) ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cosmography]] that bears a striking resemblance to modern feng shui devices and formulas appears on a piece of jade unearthed at Hanshan and dated around 3000 BC. Archaeologist [[Li Xueqin]] links the design to the ''liuren'' [[astrolabe]], ''zhinan zhen'', and [[luopan]].&lt;ref&gt;Chen Jiujin and Zhang Jingguo. 'Hanshan chutu yupian tuxing shikao,' ''Wenwu'' 4, 1989:15&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with palatial structures at [[Erlitou]],&lt;ref&gt;
Li Liu. ''The Chinese Neolithic: Trajectories to Early States.'' Cambridge University Press (2004) 230–37.
&lt;/ref&gt;
all capital cities of China followed rules of feng shui for their design and layout. During the Zhou era, the ''Kaogong ji'' ({{lang-zh|t=考工記|s=考工记}}; "Manual of Crafts") codified these rules. The carpenter's manual ''Lu ban jing'' ({{lang-zh|t=魯班經|s=鲁班经}}; "Lu ban's manuscript") codified rules for builders. Graves and tombs also followed rules of feng shui, from [[Puyang]] to [[Mawangdui]] and beyond. From the earliest records, the structures of the graves and dwellings seem to have followed the same rules.

===Early instruments and techniques===
[[File:La-chinatown-spiral.jpg|thumb|A feng shui [[spiral]] at [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|LA Chinatown]]'s [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Metro]] station]]
The history of feng shui covers 3,500+ years&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 55&lt;/ref&gt; before the invention of the magnetic compass. It originated in [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shi. Zhongguo zhaoqi xingxiangtu yanjiu. ''Zhiran kexueshi yanjiu,'' 2 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Some current techniques can be traced to [[Neolithic]] China,&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China.'' 2000: 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; while others were added later (most notably the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasty, the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], the [[Song Dynasty|Song]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass: Step by Step Guide.'' 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical history of feng shui is evident in the development of instruments and techniques. According to the ''Zhouli'', the original feng shui instrument may have been a ''[[gnomon]]''. Chinese used circumpolar stars to determine the north-south axis of settlements. This technique explains why Shang palaces at [[Yinxu|Xiaotun]] lie 10° east of due north. In some of the cases, as [[Paul Wheatley (geographer)|Paul Wheatley]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;''The Pivot of the Four Quarters'' (1971: 46)&lt;/ref&gt; they bisected the angle between the directions of the rising and setting sun to find north. This technique provided the more precise alignments of the Shang walls at [[Yanshi]] and [[Zhengzhou]]. Rituals for using a feng shui instrument required a diviner to examine current sky phenomena to set the device and adjust their position in relation to the device.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis (2006).'' The Construction of Space in Early China.'' p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest examples of instruments used for feng shui are ''liuren'' astrolabes, also known as ''shi''. These consist of a [[lacquer]]ed, two-sided board with astronomical sightlines. The earliest examples of liuren astrolabes have been unearthed from tombs that date between 278 BC and 209 BC. Along with divination for [[Da Liu Ren]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski (1996). "The Use of the Twenty-eight Xiu as a Day-Count in Early China." Chinese Science 13 (1996): 55-81.&lt;/ref&gt; the boards were commonly used to chart the motion of [[Pole star|Taiyi]] through the nine palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Yin Difei. "Xi-Han Ruyinhou mu chutu de zhanpan he tianwen yiqi." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 338-43; Yan Dunjie, "Guanyu Xi-Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan." ''Kaogu'' 1978.5, 334-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The markings on a ''liuren/shi'' and the first magnetic compasses are virtually identical.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Kalinowski. 'The ''Xingde'' Texts from [[Mawangdui]].' ''Early China.'' 23–24 (1998–99):125–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[compass|magnetic compass]] was invented for feng shui&lt;ref&gt;Wallace H. Campbell. ''Earth Magnetism: A Guided Tour Through Magnetic Fields.'' Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in use since its invention. Traditional feng shui instrumentation consists of the [[loupan|Luopan]] or the earlier south-pointing spoon (指南針 ''zhinan zhen'')—though a conventional compass could suffice if one understood the differences. A feng shui ruler (a later invention) may also be employed.

==Foundational concepts==

=== Definition and classification ===
The goal of feng shui as practiced today is to situate the human-built environment on spots with good ''qi'', an imagined form of "energy". The "perfect spot" is a location and an axis in time.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"&gt;Field, Stephen L. (1998). [http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223065625/http://www.fengshuigate.com/qimancy.html |date=2017-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"&gt;Bennett, Steven J. (1978) "Patterns of the Sky and Earth: A Chinese Science of Applied Cosmology." ''Journal of Chinese Science.'' 3:1–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui is not a science, but is classified as a [[pseudoscience]] since it exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Matthews|title=History, Philosophy and Science Teaching: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3IzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=30 August 2017|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-62616-1|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Qi'' (''ch'i'')===
[[File:Lingshan Islamic Cemetery - turtle tomb - DSCF8492.JPG|thumb|A traditional [[turtle-back tombs|turtle-back tomb]] of southern [[Fujian]], surrounded by an [[omega]]-shaped ridge protecting it from the "noxious winds" from the three sides&lt;ref name=deGroot941&gt;{{citation

|url=https://archive.org/details/religioussystemo03groo |pages=941–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''[[Qi]]''（氣）(pronounced "chee" in English) is a movable positive or negative life force which plays an essential role in feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |title=Feng Shui |publisher=Institute of Feng Shui |date= |accessdate=2011-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713043801/http://www.instituteoffengshui.com/fengshui.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In feng shui as in [[Chinese martial arts]], it refers to 'energy', in the sense of 'life force' or ''[[élan vital]]''. A traditional explanation of ''qi'' as it relates to feng shui would include the orientation of a structure, its age, and its interaction with the surrounding environment, including the local [[microclimate]]s, the slope of the land, vegetation, and soil quality.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The ''Book of Burial'' says that burial takes advantage of "vital'' qi''". Wu Yuanyin&lt;ref&gt;''Tsang ching chien chu (Tse ku chai chung ch'ao'', volume 76), p. 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; (Qing dynasty) said that vital ''qi'' was "congealed ''qi''", which is the state of ''qi'' that engenders life. The goal of feng shui is to take advantage of vital'' qi'' by appropriate siting of graves and structures.&lt;ref name="Bennett, Steven J. 1978"/&gt; Some people destroyed graveyards of their enemies to weaken their qi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stnn.cc/arts/200908/t20090810_1079619.html|title=新闻_星岛环球网|work=stnn.cc}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 房山金陵探寻_秦关汉土征未还_洪峰_博联社] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212181644/http://home.blshe.com/blog.php?uid=326&amp;id=90529 |date=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://book.ifeng.com/lianzai/detail_2010_01/11/293453_77.shtml|title=凤凰网读书频道|work=ifeng.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html 蒋介石挖毛泽东祖坟的玄机] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620232203/http://kaiyun.china.com/zh_cn/geomancy/mr/11063443/20100613/15979672.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |title=丧心病狂中国历史上六宗罕见的辱尸事 |access-date=2013-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817061329/http://culture.china.com/zh_cn/history/kaogu/11022843/20070717/14225498_4.html |archive-date=2007-08-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polarity===
[[wikt:polarity|Polarity]] is expressed in feng shui as [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] theory. Polarity expressed through ''yin'' and ''yang'' is similar to a [[magnetic dipole]]. That is, it is of two parts: one creating an exertion and one receiving the exertion. ''Yang'' acting and ''yin'' receiving could be considered an early understanding of [[Handedness|chirality]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The development of this theory and its corollary, [[Wu Xing|five phase theory (five element theory)]], have also been linked with astronomical observations of [[sunspot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Allan. ''The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art and Cosmos in Early China''. 1991:31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Elements or Forces (''wu xing'') – which, according to the Chinese, are metal, earth, fire, water, and wood – are first mentioned in Chinese literature in a chapter of the classic ''Book of History''. They play a very important part in Chinese thought: ‘elements’ meaning generally not so much the actual substances as the forces essential to human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=E. T. C.|title=Myths and Legends of China|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London Bombay Sydney|page=84|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15250/15250-h/15250-h.htm|accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=0-486-28092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is a buffer, or an equilibrium achieved when the polarities cancel each other.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} While the goal of Chinese medicine is to balance yin and yang in the body, the goal of feng shui has been described as aligning a city, site, building, or object with yin-yang force fields.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''The Legacy of the Luoshu.'' pp. 31, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bagua (eight trigrams)===
Eight diagrams known as [[Ba gua|''bagua'']] (or ''pa kua'') loom large in feng shui, and both predate their mentions in the ''[[Yijing]]'' (or ''[[I Ching]]'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''Lo (River) Chart'' (''[[Luoshu]]'') was developed first,&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Swetz (2002). ''Legacy of the Luoshu''. p. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes associated with ''Later Heaven'' arrangement of the bagua. This and the ''[[Yellow River Map|Yellow River Chart]]'' (''Hetu'', sometimes associated with the ''Earlier Heaven bagua'') are linked to astronomical events of the sixth millennium BC, and with the Turtle Calendar from the time of Yao.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lynn Porter. ''From Deluge to Discourse.'' 1996:35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turtle Calendar of Yao (found in the ''Yaodian'' section of the ''Shangshu'' or ''Book of Documents'') dates to 2300 BC, plus or minus 250 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sun and Kistemaker. ''The Chinese Sky During the Han.'' 1997:15–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yaodian'', the cardinal directions are determined by the marker-stars of the mega-constellations known as the Four Celestial Animals:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*East: The [[Azure Dragon]] (Spring equinox)—''Niao'' (Bird 鳥), [[Antares|α Scorpionis]]
*South: The [[Vermilion Bird]] (Summer solstice)—''Huo'' (Fire 火), [[Alpha Hydrae|α Hydrae]]
*West: The [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]] (Autumn equinox)—''Mǎo'' (Hair 毛), η Tauri (the [[Pleiades]])
*North: The [[Black Tortoise]] (Winter solstice)—''Xū'' (Emptiness, Void 虛), [[Alpha Aquarii|α Aquarii]], [[Beta Aquarii|β Aquarii]]

The diagrams are also linked with the ''sifang'' (four directions) method of divination used during the Shang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Aihe Wang. ''Cosmology and Political Structure in Early China.'' 2000: 107–28&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sifang'' is much older, however. It was used at Niuheliang, and figured large in [[Hongshan culture]]'s astronomy. And it is this area of China that is linked to [[Yellow Emperor]] (Huangdi) who allegedly invented the south-pointing spoon (see [[Compass#China|compass]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock, and Robert E. Stencel. ''[https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923142811/https://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863 |date=2006-09-23 }}.'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional feng shui==
Traditional feng shui is an ancient system based upon the observation of heavenly time and earthly space. The literature of ancient China, as well as archaeological evidence, provide some idea of the origins and nature of the original feng shui techniques.

===Form School===
The Form School is the oldest school of feng shui. [[Qing Wuzi]] in the [[Han dynasty]] describes it in the "Book of the Tomb" [https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV09cvO8sYC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20Wuzi&amp;f=false] and [[Guo Pu]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] follows up with a more complete description in ''[[The Book of Burial]]''.

The Form School was originally concerned with the location and orientation of tombs ([[Yin House feng shui]]), which was of great importance.&lt;ref name="Qimancy: Chinese Divination by Qi"/&gt; The school then progressed to the consideration of homes and other buildings ([[Yang House feng shui]]).

The "form" in Form School refers to the shape of the environment, such as mountains, rivers, plateaus, buildings, and general surroundings. It considers the five celestial animals (phoenix, green dragon, white tiger, black turtle, and the yellow snake), the [[yin-yang]] concept and the traditional five elements ([[Wu Xing]]: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water).

The Form School analyses the shape of the land and flow of the wind and water to find a place with ideal [[qi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui|authors=Moran, Yu, Biktashev|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also considers the time of important events such as the birth of the resident and the building of the structure.

===Compass School===
The Compass School is a collection of more recent feng shui techniques based on the eight [[cardinal directions]], each of which is said to have unique qi. It uses the [[Luopan]], a disc marked with formulas in concentric rings around a magnetic compass.&lt;ref name="fengshuinatural1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools|url=http://www.fengshuinatural.com/en/schools.html|publisher=Feng Shui Natural|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Jian Jun and Adriana Fernandes-Gonçalves. ''Chinese Feng Shui Compass Step by Step Guide.'' 1998:46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoonChin. ''Chinese Metaphysics: Essential Feng Shui Basics.'' {{ISBN|978-983-43773-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compass School includes techniques such as [[Flying Star (feng shui technique)|Flying Star]] and [[Eight Mansions]].

===Transmission of traditional feng shui techniques===
Aside from the books written throughout history by feng shui masters and students, there is also a strong oral history. In many cases, masters have passed on their techniques only to selected students or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cheung Ngam Fung | first =Jacky | title =History of Feng Shui| publisher = | year =2007 | url =http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html| accessdate = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122452/http://www.fengshui-liufa.com/history.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current usage of traditional schools===
There is no contemporary agreement that one of the traditional schools is most correct. Therefore, modern practitioners of feng shui generally draw from multiple schools in their own practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feng Shui Schools |url=http://interiordesigncoursesdelhiinstitutes.in/2018/10/26/feng-shui-schools-delhi/|publisher=Feng Shui Natural |accessdate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western forms of feng shui==
More recent forms of feng shui simplify principles that come from the traditional schools, and focus mainly on the use of the [[bagua]].

===Aspirations Method===
The [[Eight Life Aspirations]] style of feng shui is a simple system which coordinates each of the eight cardinal directions with a specific life aspiration or station such as family, wealth, fame, etc., which come from the [[Ba gua#Bagua of the eight aspirations|Bagua government of the eight aspirations]]. Life Aspirations is not otherwise a geomantic system.

===Traditional feng shui===
Traditional feng shui relies upon the compass to give accurate readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to the Feng Shui Compass: A Compendium of Classical Feng Shui|first=Stephen|last=Skinner|publisher=[[Golden Hoard]]|year=2008|isbn=9780954763992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqU2uQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UCNAAAAQBAJ|p=185|title=Feng Shui for the Curious and Serious|volume=1|first=Phil N.|last=Nguyen|publisher=[[Xlibris Corporation]]|year=2008|isbn=9781469118826}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics point out that the compass degrees are often inaccurate as fluctuations caused by solar winds have the ability to greatly disturb the electromagnetic field of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|p=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4xDhVCxAQIC|title=The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System|first=Kenneth R.|last=Lang|edition=2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=9781139494175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a property or site location based upon Magnetic North will result in inaccuracies because true magnetic north fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield|publisher=NASA Science|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610), one of the founding fathers of [[Jesuit China missions]], may have been the first European to write about feng shui practices. His account in ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]...'' tells about feng shui masters (''geologi'', in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites "with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot". As a Catholic missionary, Ricci strongly criticized the "recondite science" of geomancy along with [[astrology]] as yet another ''superstitio absurdissima'' of the heathens: "What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?".&lt;ref&gt;"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953. Book One, Chapter 9, pp. 84–85. This text appears in pp. 103–04 of Book One of the original Latin text by Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ&amp;lr=&amp;pg=RA1-PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian-era commentators on feng shui were generally ethnocentric, and as such skeptical and derogatory of what they knew of feng shui.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. March. 'An Appreciation of Chinese Geomancy' in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2. (February 1968), pp. 253–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, at a meeting of the Educational Association of China, Rev. P.W. Pitcher railed at the "rottenness of the whole scheme of Chinese architecture," and urged fellow missionaries "to erect unabashedly Western edifices of several stories and with towering spires in order to destroy nonsense about ''fung-shuy''".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey W.

After the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, feng shui was officially considered a "feudalistic superstitious practice" and a "social evil" according to the state's ideology and was discouraged and even banned outright at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |title=Chang Liang (pseudoym), 14 January 2005, ''What Does Superstitious Belief of 'Feng Shui' Among School Students Reveal?'' |publisher=Zjc.zjol.com.cn |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306142756/http://zjc.zjol.com.cn/05zjc/system/2005/01/14/003828695.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.csdn.net/taoshilong/archive/2006/04/03/649650.aspx Tao Shilong, 3 April 2006, ''The Crooked Evil of 'Feng Shui' Is Corrupting The Minds of Chinese People'']{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feng shui remained popular in Hong Kong, and also in the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]], where traditional culture was not suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/hongkong/8206601/Hong-Kong-government-spends-millions-on-feng-shui.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Malcolm | last=Moore | title=Hong Kong government spends millions on feng shui | date=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution was the most severe during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when feng shui was classified as a custom under the so-called [[Four Olds]] to be wiped out. Feng shui practitioners were beaten and abused by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] and their works burned. After the death of [[Mao Zedong]] and the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the official attitude became more tolerant but restrictions on feng shui practice are still in place in today's [[China]]. It is illegal in the PRC today to register feng shui consultation as a business and similarly advertising feng shui practice is banned. There have been frequent crackdowns on feng shui practitioners on the grounds of "promoting feudalistic superstitions" such as one in Qingdao in early 2006 when the city's business and industrial administration office shut down an art gallery converted into a feng shui practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html Chen Xintang ''Art Gallery Shut by the Municipality's Business and Industrial Department After Converting to 'Feng Shui' Consultation Office'' Banduo Daoxi Bao, Qingdao, January 19, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426162415/http://gwzz.blogbus.com/logs/2006/01/1854093.html |date=April 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some communist officials who had previously consulted feng shui were terminated and expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/chinese/news/newsid_1210000/12108792.stm |title="風水迷信"困擾中國當局 – Feng Shui Superstitions Troubles Chinese Authorities|publisher=BBC News |date=9 March 2001|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly because of the [[Cultural Revolution]], in today's mainland China less than one-third of the population believe in feng shui, and the proportion of believers among young urban Chinese is said to be much lower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 ''Debate on Feng Shui''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232943/http://www.yuce49.com/showjs.asp?js_id=45 |date=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning feng shui is still somewhat considered taboo in today's China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com/58913151.html |title=Beware of Scams Among the Genuine Feng Shui Practitioners |publisher=Jiugu861sohu.blog.sohu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/27296/3941393.html|title=ˮȨɽ--Ļ--|work=people.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|title=方术之国|work=newmind40.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040204/http://newmind40.com/01_4/hxd2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is reported that feng shui has gained adherents among Communist Party officials according to a BBC Chinese news commentary in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jiang Xun |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/chinese/trad/hi/newsid_4870000/newsid_4872500/4872542.stm |title=Focus on China ''From Voodoo Dolls to Feng Shui Superstitions''|language=Chinese|publisher=BBC Chinese service|date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since the beginning of Chinese economic reforms the number of feng shui practitioners is increasing. A number of Chinese academics permitted to research on the subject of feng shui are anthropologists or architects by profession, studying the history of feng shui or historical feng shui theories behind the design of heritage buildings, such as Cao Dafeng, the Vice-President of [[Fudan University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |title=蔡达峰 – Cao Dafeng |publisher=Fudan.edu.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509032825/http://fudan.edu.cn/new_genview/now_caidafeng.htm |archivedate=2012-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Liu Shenghuan of [[Tongji University]].

===Contemporary feng shui===
Westerners were criticized at the start of the anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] for violating the basic principles of feng shui in the construction of railroads and other conspicuous public structures throughout China. However, today, feng shui is practiced not only by the Chinese, but also by Westerners and still criticized by Christians around the world. Many modern Christians have an opinion of feng shui similar to that of their predecessors:&lt;ref&gt;Mah, Y.-B. Living in Harmony with One's Environment: A Christian Response to Feng Shui. ''Asia Journal of Theology.'' 2004, 18; Part 2, pp 340–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is entirely inconsistent with Christianity to believe that harmony and balance result from the manipulation and channeling of nonphysical forces or energies, or that such can be done by means of the proper placement of physical objects. Such techniques, in fact, belong to the world of sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Montenegro. Feng Shui" New Dimensions in Design. ''Christian Research Journal.'' 26:1 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still others are simply skeptical of feng shui. Evidence for its effectiveness is based primarily upon anecdote and users are often offered conflicting advice from different practitioners. Feng shui practitioners use these differences as evidence of variations in practice or different schools of thought. Critical analysts have described it thus: "Feng shui has always been based upon mere guesswork".&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Joshua Dukes, The Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, T &amp; T Clark, Edinburgh, 1971, p 834&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monty Vierra. Harried by "Hellions" in Taiwan. ''Sceptical Briefs'' newsletter, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are skeptical of feng shui's lasting impact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mulcock. Creativity and Politics in the Cultural Supermarket: synthesizing indigenous identities for the r-evolution of spirit. ''Continuum''. 15:2. July 2001, 169–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Johnson:&lt;ref&gt;"Reality Testing in Feng Shui." ''Qi'' Journal. Spring 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This present state of affairs is ludicrous and confusing. Do we really believe that mirrors and flutes are going to change people's tendencies in any lasting and meaningful way? ... There is a lot of investigation that needs to be done or we will all go down the tubes because of our inability to match our exaggerated claims with lasting changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, after [[Richard Nixon]] journeyed to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1972, feng shui became marketable in the [[United States]] and has since been reinvented by New Age [[entrepreneur]]s for Western consumption. Critics of contemporary feng shui are concerned that with the passage of time much of the theory behind it has been lost in translation, not paid proper consideration, frowned upon, or even scorned. Robert T. Carroll sums up what feng shui has become in some instances:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...feng shui has become an aspect of interior decorating in the Western world and alleged masters of feng shui now hire themselves out for hefty sums to tell people such as [[Donald Trump]] which way his doors and other things should hang. Feng shui has also become another New Age "energy" scam with arrays of metaphysical products...offered for sale to help you improve your health, maximize your potential, and guarantee fulfillment of some fortune cookie philosophy.&lt;ref name="The Skeptic's Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/fengshui.html |title=feng shui|first= Robert T. |last=Carroll |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others have noted how, when feng shui is not applied properly, it can even harm the environment, such as was the case of people planting "lucky bamboo" in ecosystems that could not handle them.&lt;ref name="Fabulous Feng Shui"&gt;Elizabeth Hilts, [http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= "Fabulous Feng Shui: It's Certainly Popular, But is it Eco-Friendly?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227193557/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?1189&amp;src= |date=2005-02-27 }} ''E'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Feng shui practitioners in China find superstitious and corrupt officials easy prey, despite official disapproval. In one instance, in 2009, county officials in [[Gansu]], on the advice of feng shui practitioners, spent $732,000 to haul a 369-ton "spirit rock" to the county seat to ward off "bad luck."&lt;ref name=NYT51013&gt;{{cite news|title=China Officials Seek Career Shortcut With Feng Shui|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/asia/feng-shui-grows-in-china-as-officials-seek-success.html|accessdate=May 11, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 10, 2013|author=Dan Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage magician duo [[Penn and Teller]] dedicated an episode of their ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' television show to criticise the construal of contemporary practice of Feng Shui in the Western World as [[science]]. In this episode, they devised a test in which the same dwelling was visited by five different Feng Shui consultants, all five producing different opinions about said dwelling, by which means it was attempted to show there is no consistency in the professional practice of Feng Shui.

==Contemporary practice ==

Many Asians, especially people of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent, believe it{{clarify|date=February 2014}}&lt;!-- I hope this "it" refers to feng shui, and not just states the importance of living such life. --&gt; is important to live a prosperous and healthy life as evident by the popularity of [[Fu Lu Shou]] in the Chinese communities. Many of the higher-level forms of feng shui are not easily practiced without having connections in the community or a certain amount of wealth because hiring an expert, altering architecture or design, and moving from place to place requires a significant financial outlay. This leads some people of the lower classes to lose faith in feng shui, saying that it is only a game for the wealthy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''1"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, practice less expensive forms of feng shui, including hanging special (but cheap) mirrors, forks, or woks in doorways to deflect negative energy.&lt;ref name="''Journal of Popular Culture''2"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=January 2013}} a new brand of easier-to-implement [[Do it yourself|DIY]] Feng Shui known as ''Symbolic Feng Shui'', which is popularized by best-selling author [[Lillian Too]], is being practised by Feng Shui [[enthusiast]]s. It entails placements of auspicious (and preferably aesthetically pleasing) [[Wu Xing|Five Element]] objects, such as ''Money God'' and ''tortoise'', at various locations of the house so as to achieve a pleasing and substitute-alternative ''Productive-Cycle'' environment if a good natural environment is not already present or is too expensive to build and implement.

Feng shui is so important to some strong believers, that they use it for healing purposes (although there is no empirical evidence that this practice is in any way effective) in addition to guide their businesses and create a peaceful atmosphere in their homes,&lt;ref name="Journal of Popular Culture''3"&gt;Emmons, C. F. "Hong Kong's Feng Shui: Popular Magic in a Modern Urban Setting." ''Journal of Popular Culture'', Volume 26, Issue 1, Summer 1992, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; in particular in the bedroom where a number of techniques involving colours and arrangement are used to achieve enhanced comfort and more peaceful sleep.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2005, even Disney acknowledged feng shui as an important part of Chinese culture by shifting the main gate to [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] by twelve degrees in their building plans, among many other actions suggested by the master planner of architecture and design at Walt Disney Imagineering, [[Wing Chao]], in an effort to incorporate local culture into the theme park.&lt;ref name="Feng Shui Kingdom"&gt;Laura M.

At [[Singapore polytechnic|Singapore Polytechnic]] and other institutions, many working professionals from various disciplines (including engineers, architects, property agents and [[interior design]]ers) take courses on feng shui and divination every year with a number of them becoming part-time or full-time feng shui (or [[geomancy]]) consultants eventually.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090206-119946.html |title=Feng Shui course gains popularity |publisher=Asiaone.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studia Geophysica Et Geodaetica, 55(1), 159–74. {{doi|10.1007/s11200-011-0009-2}}. Abstract: "Extant written records indicate that knowledge of an ancient type of compass in China is very old – dating back to before the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) to at least the 4th century BC. Geomancy (feng shui) was practised for a long time (for millennia) and had a profound influence on the face of China's landscape and city plans. The tombs (pyramids) near the former Chinese capital cities of Xi'an and Luoyang (together with their suburban fields and roads) show strong spatial orientations, sometimes along a basic South-North axis (relative to the geographic pole), but usually with deviations of several degrees to the East or West. The use of the compass means that the needle was directed towards the actual magnetic pole at the time of construction, or last reconstruction, of the respective tomb. However the magnetic pole, relative to the nearly 'fixed' geographic pole, shifts significantly over time. By matching paleomagnetic observations with modeled paleomagnetic history we have identified the date of pyramid construction in central China with the orientation relative to the magnetic pole positions at the respective time of construction. As in Mesoamerica, where according to the Fuson hypothesis the Olmecs and Maya oriented their ceremonial buildings and pyramids using a compass even before the Chinese, here in central China the same technique may have been used. We found a good agreement of trends between the paleodeclinations observed from tomb alignments and the available global geomagnetic field model CALS7K.2."

'''Fredson Thayer Bowers''' (April 25, 1905 – April 11, 1991) was an American [[Bibliography|bibliographer]] and scholar of [[Textual criticism|textual editing]].

==Life==
Bowers was a graduate of [[Brown University]] and [[Harvard University]] (Ph.D.). He taught at [[Princeton University]] before moving to the [[University of Virginia]] in 1938.

Bowers served as a [[Commander (United States)#Naval rank|commander]] in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II leading a group of [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]].

In 1947 he led a group of faculty and interested local citizens in founding the [[Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia]], of which he served as president for many years. He founded its annual publication, ''[[Studies in Bibliography]]'', which became a leading journal in the field.

Bowers was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1958. 
In 1969 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the [[Bibliographical Society]] (of London).

He retired in 1975 and at the time of his death, he was Linden Kent Professor of English Emeritus at the University of Virginia.  His second wife, novelist [[Nancy Hale]], died before him in 1988.  Bowers had three sons and a daughter with his first wife: Fredson Bowers, Jr., Stephen, Peter, and Joan.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/13/obituaries/fredson-bowers-85-a-specialist-in-bibliography-and-manuscripts.html |title=Fredson Bowers, 85, a specialist in bibliography and manuscripts |first=Glenn |last=Fowler |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=April 13, 1991 |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetic editing''' ([[French language|French]] ''critique génétique''; [[German language|German]] ''genetische Kritik'') is an approach to scholarly editing in which an [[Exemplar (textual criticism)|exemplar]] is seen as derived from a dossier of other [[manuscript]]s and events. The derivation can be through physical [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]; writing or drawing in a variety of media; quotation, [[annotation]] or correction; acts of physical defacement; etc.  Genetic editing aims to reconstruct the sequence of actions on the manuscript and exactly which parts of the manuscript were acted upon. Where multiple manuscripts have been combined (through for example cut and paste or quotation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/gencrit/index.html|title=Textual Scholarship: Genetic Criticism|date=|work=textualscholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cts.dmu.ac.uk/index.php?q=objectives.html] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30227768|title=The "Wake's Progress": Toward a Genetic Edition|first=Dirk|last=Van Hulle|date=17 January 2018|publisher=|journal=Text|volume=13|pages=221–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic editing is strong in European, particularly French and German, [[textual scholarship]]. Completed works of genetic editing are known as genetic editions.

Whereas traditional scholarly editing can be seen as constructing a new document drawing together and comparing many source documents to cast light on a work, genetic editing closely examines a single [[Extant literature|extant]] manuscript and traces back each aspect to cast light on the work.

Genetic editing is named by analogy with genetics manuscripts (individuals) are derived from other manuscripts (or previous states of the same manuscript) and with the derivation tree being a partial [[Tree (data structure)|ordered tree]].

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]]'s [[XML]] format has support for encoding of genetic editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PH-changes|title=TEI Guidelines 11.7 Identifying Changes and Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11134">The '''''Heidelberg Appeal''''', authored by [[Michel Salomon]], was an appeal directed against the findings of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;James Lawrence Powell: ''The Inquisition of Climate Science''. New York 2012, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; organised initially by the tobacco industry as part of its "junk-science" program. The Heidelberg Appeal's goal was similar to the later published [[Leipzig Declaration]] and an earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Allison |last2=Robinson |first2=John |date=2004 |title=RELEVANT BUT NOT PRESCRIPTIVE?

It was published at the last day of the [[Rio Summit]] 1992 and warned governments that they don't base their policy on environmental policy, which they regarded as "pseudoscientific arguments or false and nonrelevant data."&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt; It was brought forward by the tobacco and asbestos industry, to support the climate-denying [[Global Climate Coalition]]. According to [[SourceWatch]] the appeal is "a scam perpetrated by the asbestos and tobacco industries in support of the Global Climate Coalition". Both industries had no direct reason to deny global warming, but rather wanted to promote their "sound science" agenda, which basically states that industry-funded science is good science and science contradicting those science (such as environmental science) is bad science or "[[junk science]]".&lt;ref name="Powell" /&gt;

==Signed up for what?==

The technique used by Salomon's group to enlist members of the scientific establishment to lend their names to climate denial by signing the Appeal document, was quite unique. It is important to realise that, at this time, some sections of the environmental movement were anti-science, and anti-technology.  They blamed the scientists as much as the industrialists for damaging the ecology of the planet.

The document most of the signatories thought they were signing was an appeal for the society to pay more attention to scientists than to the many irrational health and environmental activists. They were objecting to the way in which they were losing their privileged position as the 'go-to authorities' on all such health and environmental matters.  They didn't see this as a climate-denial statement.

One of the signatories, Nobel Prize winner [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], a professor of physics at Princeton University, cited the continued dispersal of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as a prime example of an environmentally hazardous situation identified by scientists.  He complained that despite science's disapproval, CFC's persists to be released as a result of industrial interests and denial of potential harm. He asserted that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It's a sneaky thing to keep the CFC plants going. [... However ... ] industrialists, not scientists are to blame for much of the planet's ecological degradation."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He agreed with Salomon in attacking the animal-rights people as &lt;blockquote&gt;''"clearly irrational?" [... ] "This is obvious when they resort to illegality and violence to propagate their ends." [such] forces "make the public afraid of science."'' 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.the-scientist.com/news/rio-document-spurs-debate-is-science-an-ecological-foe-60005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No draft of the original signed document exists, but participants have since claimed that the document they signed was a general 'motherhood' statement about the need for better science in dealing with hazardous and health-related products.  However, when release and publicised by [[Fred Singer]]'s [[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] operation specific mention of climate change was added in the introductory passages and press release.  It was carefully released to coincide with the opening of the Rio Earth Summit.

==Success?==

The ''Heidelberg Appeal'' has been enthusiastically embraced by large corporations and individual critics of the environmental movement. Conservative think tanks frequently cite the Heidelberg Appeal as proof that scientists reject the theory of [[global warming]] as well as a host of other environmental health risks associated with modern science and industry. Its name has subsequently been adopted by the [[Heidelberg Appeal Nederland Foundation]], which was founded in 1993 and disputes health risks related to nitrates in foods and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Heidelberg Appeal was promoted in 1993 by the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]], a group set up by Michael Salomon "that was considered important in [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]' plans to create a group in Europe similar to [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1446867 | pmid=11684592 | volume=91 | title=Junking science to promote tobacco | date=November 2001 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1745–8 | last1 = Yach | first1 = D | last2 = Bialous | first2 = SA | doi=10.2105/ajph.91.11.1745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html International Center for A Scientific Ecology Guidelines for the Seminar on Linear Relationship for Risk Assessment of Low Doses of Carcinogens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014201129/http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2028385372.html |date=2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Originator ==

Michel Salomon was the editor of the Paris-based "Projections" magazine. He was hired by Philip Morris to extend their junk-science program into Europe. They had already been highly successful with:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt; TASSC ([[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]]) in the US under [[Steven Milloy]], &lt;br&gt; &lt;LI&gt; SEPP ([[Science &amp; Environmental Policy Project]] (run by Fred Singer) and semi-attached to TASSC.
&lt;LI&gt; ESEF ([[European Science and Environment Forum]]) run by [[Roger Bate]] on secondment from the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] in London.&lt;/ul&gt;

Following the Heidelberg Appeal, Salomon established for them the ICSE (aka "CIES") which is variously quoted in the tobacco archive documents as the [[International Center for a Scientific Ecology]] or, in French, the [[Centre International pour une Ecologie Scientifique]].  He wrote about the appeal:
 &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; ''... we brought together at Heidelberg about fifty well-known scientists, including Nobel Prize winners Rita Levi and Manfred Eigen, as well as medical practitioners, sociologists, moralists and members of the editorial staff of Projections. They came from a range of disciplines, from numerous European countries, including the former Soviet Union, and had divergent views on many questions. 

Why Heidelberg? We wanted to meet in a prestigious European university town. Oxford or Cambridge would have done just as well. The warm welcome we received at the beginning of our round of the university towns, from cardiologist Gothard Schettler, Vice President of the Academy of Science at Heidelberg, and from Professor Harald zur Hausen at the Cancer Research Institute, persuaded us to pitch our tent on the banks of the Neckar. As the substances in question were incriminated, among other things, for their supposed or real carcinogenic effects, we accepted Professor zur Hausen's generous hospitality.  

 The Heidelberg meeting was lively and fruitful. Experts in CFCs, dioxins, radiation and asbestos summarized the latest epidemiological and other research on the impact of these substances on health, and their conclusions were discussed by the members of the meeting. But the question of the coming ''' Earth Summit''' preoccupied the participants too much for them to stop at purely technical discussions. ''' We were therefore not overly surprised when numerous voices were raised wanting the group to discuss Rio and to adopt a definite position on the matter.'''

 &lt;u&gt;We had rather anticipated this reaction&lt;/u&gt;. An initial text which we had passed round friends in Paris had already attracted about fifty signatures. We presented it at Heidelberg. It was discussed paragraph by paragraph, word by word. The Heidelberg declaration in its present version was the result of those discussions. '' &lt;ref&gt;  Michel Salomon editorial Projections, April 14 1992.  http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/yqg80c00/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

'''Human Rights and Climate Change''' is a conceptual and legal framework under which international [[human rights]] and their relationship to [[global warming]] are studied, analyzed, and addressed. The framework has been employed by governments, [[United Nations]] organizations, [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]], human rights and environmental advocates, and academics to guide national and international policy on climate change under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the core [[international human rights instruments]].
	
	Human rights and climate change analysis focuses on the anticipated consequences to humans associated with global environmental phenomena including [[sea level rise]], [[desertification]], temperature increases, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation, as well as [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] measures taken by governments in response to those phenomena that may involve human rights or related legal protections.

In 2005, Inuit activist [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] filed a petition to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] seeking relief "from human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change caused by acts and omissions of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petition to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations Resulting from Global Warming Caused by Acts and Omissions of the United States|date=7 December 2005|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/files/uploads/icc-files/FINALPetitionICC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected, but the Commission invited and heard testimony on the relationship between human rights and climate change from representatives for the Inuit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieg|first=Richard|title=At International Commission, Inuit Want to See Change in U.S. Policy on Global Warming|url=http://www.vjel.org/news/NEWS100058.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change "stated explicitly (and for the first time in an international agreement) that 'climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights' and called on the United Nations human rights system to address the issue as a matter of urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Limon|first=Marc|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CONSTRUCTING A CASE FOR POLITICAL ACTION|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=439–476|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Limon.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change|date=14 November 2007|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Male_Declaration_Nov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Climate change|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC) unanimously adopted Resolution 7/23, recognizing that "climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights," and citing the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 7/23, Human rights and climate change|date=28 March 2008|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC reaffirmed and expanded these statements with resolutions 10/4 of 25 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 18/22 of 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=A/HRC/RES/18/22 Human rights and climate change|date=30 September 2011|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/6246410.01224518.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) released an analytical study identifying specific rights and people groups likely to be adversely affected by climate disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCHR|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report drew on the submissions of some 30 nations as well as ten [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations Agencies]] and dozens of other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OHCHR|title=OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights: Submissions and reference documents received|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/HRAndClimateChange/Pages/Submissions.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified displaced persons, conflict and security risks as well as impaired rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children as major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|title=Report|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}, n.8, at 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I, Annex II countries and developing countries|Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC]] reproduced the HRC's language identifying the relationship between human rights and climate change in its report on the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conference of the Parties|title=FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010, Addendum, Part Two: Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the outcome of the Conference emphasized that "Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Id.''|journal=Decision 1/CP.16, The Cancun Agreements:  Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased recognition of the link between human rights and the environment, yet there are still many questions surrounding the relationship between them. As a result, in 2012 the HRC established a mandate on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 19/10, Human rights and the environment|date=19 April 2012|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/131/59/PDF/G1213159.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report by the appointed Independent Expert, John H. Knox, further stated that there needed to be priority in providing greater conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=24 December 2012|issue=A/HRC/22/43|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, all 78 of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders issued a joint statement on [[Human Rights Day]] calling for states to incorporate their existing obligations under the human rights framework into climate change negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&amp;|title=OHCHR {{!}} Statement of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders on the occasion of the Human Rights Day Geneva, 10 December 2014|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have the effect of bringing the rights of those affected by climate change to the forefront of all response strategies. 

As of March 2015, there is now a [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights and the environment, an extension of the mandate of the former Independent Expert on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 28/11, Human rights and the environment|date=7 April 2015|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/071/78/PDF/G1507178.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, the Special Rapporteur informed states that they should ensure their human rights obligations encompass the appropriate perspective towards climate change when negotiating future agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16836&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} COP21: "States’ human rights obligations encompass climate change" – UN expert|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Agreement''', as adopted on the 12 December 2015 at the Conference of the Parties, is the most important indication of increasing awareness towards the relationship between climate change and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=1 February 2016|issue=A/HRC/31/52|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement is the first climate agreement to recognise the relevance of human rights, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNFCCC|date=12 December 2015|title=Adoption of the Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|issue=FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human rights law and climate change ==
Climate change is inducing not only ecological adjustments, but is also impacting the social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of societies around the world. The HRC has affirmed that human rights obligations have the ability to strengthen both international and national policy-making in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Declaration]] provided the basis for further elaboration of a human right to environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271647969|title=International law and the environment|last=W.|first=Birnie, Patricia|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Boyle, Alan E., Redgwell, Catherine.|isbn=9780198764229|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=271647969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protection is not commonly included in human rights treaties. Rather environmental protection is derived from the rights that those treaties protect, such as the rights to life, food and water and health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724352139|title=Human rights and climate change : a review of the international legal dimensions.|last=1974-|first=McInerney-Lankford, Siobhán Alice,|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|others=Darrow, Mac., Rajamani, Lavanya., World Bank.|isbn=9780821387207|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=724352139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving forward, human rights law in the context of climate change policy-making may help to establish minimum standards of basic human rights that can be adopted in international and national mitigation and adaption measures.

==Rights implicated==
	Most international statements on human rights and climate change have emphasized the potential adverse impacts of climate change on the rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to food|food]], [[right to water|water]], [[right to health|health]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to development|development]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Malé Declaration, n.4; UNHRC Resolution 18/22, n.7; A/HRC/10/61, n.8; FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human rights, climate change and cross-border displacement|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/human-rights-climate-change-and-cross-border-displacement-the-role-of-the-international-human-rights-community-in-contributing-to-effective-and-just-solutions/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are enumerated in the core conventions of [[international human rights law]], though not all HRC members or UNFCCC parties are signatories of these conventions.

=== Right to life ===
The right to life is protected by Article 6 of the ICCPR where every human being has the inherent right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCRC|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|date=23 March 1976|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to life is inextricably linked to the measure of fulfilment of other rights. There are both projected and observed effects that climate change will have on the right to life. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] ('''IPCC''') [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] projected an increase in people suffering from death and injury occurring from an increase in floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and droughts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/AnalyticalStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will equally affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and related disorder impacting child growth and development, respiratory morbidity and ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rising sea levels is one of the flow-on effects of climate change, resulting from warming water and melting ice sheets.  Measuring sea level rise is a complicated affair, however the IPCC have projected an increase in global mean sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/what-definition-global-mean-sea-level-gmsl-and-its-rate|title=What is the definition of global mean sea level (GMSL) and its rate? {{!}} CU Sea Level Research Group|website=sealevel.colorado.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of between 0.44m and 0.74m by 2100.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2007|title=Fourth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_full_report.pdf|journal=|volume=|issue=AR4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low-lying coastal islands such as Male', in the Maldives, a sea level rise of 0.5 metres would inundate 15 per cent of the island by 2025, and flood half of it by 2100.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As 42 per cent of the population lives within 100m within the coastline, even partial flooding is likely to result in drowning, injury and loss of life.

Observed effects are those where the right to life has already inhibited the right to life. There is difficulty in studying the impacts of climate change itself because of the issue of scale; climate change is measured in decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is more than 95 per cent chance that [[anthropogenic climate change]] quadrupled the risk of extreme summer heat events in Europe in the decade 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christidis|first=Nikolaos|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth S.|last4=Shiogama|first4=Hideo|last5=Nozawa|first5=Toru|last6=Luterbacher|first6=Jürg|date=2012-02-01|title=Human activity and anomalously warm seasons in Europe|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2262/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=225–239|doi=10.1002/joc.2262|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a probability of 75 per cent that the 2003 heat wave in Europe was attributable to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On this basis, the excess mortality rate from this event registered at 15,000 deaths in France alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouillet|first=A.|last2=Rey|first2=G.|last3=Laurent|first3=F.|last4=Pavillon|first4=G.|last5=Bellec|first5=S.|last6=Guihenneuc-Jouyaux|first6=C.|last7=Clavel|first7=J.|last8=Jougla|first8=E.|last9=Hémon|first9=Denis|title=Excess mortality related to the August 2003 heat wave in France|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|issn=0340-0131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to food ===
This is derived from Article II of the ICESCR where States party to the Covenant have to maximise their available resources to the achieve the right to adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to affect all four pillars of [[food security]]; availability, access, utilization and stability. A 2008 report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the way the world grows food will have to undergo radical change to cope with a growing population and the effects of climate change, while avoiding environmental collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Building resilience: a human rights framework for world food and nutrition security |date=8 September 2008|issue=A/HRC/9/23|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A.HRC.9.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement recognises the fundamental priority of ensuring food security and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 2 calls for adaption to the adverse impacts of climate change and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that will not threaten food production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IPCC fourth assessment report projects that food production will increase in the mid to high latitudes with a temperature increase of between 1° and 3&amp;nbsp;°C, however at lower latitudes crop productivity is set to decrease which increases the risk of food insecurity in poorer regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimate an additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNDP|first=|date=2007|title=Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/corporate/HDR/2006%20Global%20HDR/HDR-2006-Beyond%20scarcity-Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis.pdf|journal=Human Development Report|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have a particularly devastating effect on Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|title=Working Group II Report|date=2007|issue=AR4|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to water ===
The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''CESCR''') notes that the right to water is not only an essential condition to survival, but also that it is inextricably linked with other rights, such as; [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to health|attainable standard of health]], [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]], and [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CESCR|title=General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water (Arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant)  |date=20 January 2003|issue=E/C.12/2002/11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4538838d11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] states that people will feel the effects of climate change the most strongly through changes in patterns of water distribution around the globe.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-12-01|title=The Stern Review on the Economic Effects of Climate Change|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x|issn=1728-4457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those areas that are already experiencing dry conditions will experience a further decrease in water availability, with several (but not all) climate models predicting up to a 30 per cent decrease in annual run-off in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Africa and South America for a 2&amp;nbsp;°C global temperature rise, and 40 – 50 per cent for 4&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652432164|title=Human rights and climate change|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Humphreys, Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780521762762|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=652432164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC fifth assessment report]] states that freshwater-related risks increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, with climate change over the 21st century projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2014|title=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf|journal=|volume=AR5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to health ===
Article 12 of the '''ICESCR''' identifies the "right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most national constitutions protect the right to health in some manner, and it is widely safeguarded in other international and regional instruments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights and Climate Change : A Review of the International Legal Dimensions|last1=McInerney-Lankford|first1=Siobhan|last2=Darrow|first2=Mac|last3=Rajamani|first3=Lavanya|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780821387207|location=|pages=|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to amplify health disparities between the rich and poor in different parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] ('''WHO''') estimates that since 1970, climate change is responsible for 150,000 deaths every year through increasing incidence in the spread of diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition predominantly in Africa and other developing regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature from pre-industrial levels could double the annual deaths from climate change (according to WHO).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Specific issues==

===Displacement===
Potential climate induced migration is currently one of the most disputed flow-on effects from climate change. Research suggests that climate change may create some 50 to 200 million new [[internally displaced persons]] and international [[refugees]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Docherty|first=Bonnie|author2=Tyler Giannini|title=Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climage Change Refugees|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|pages=349–403|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Docherty%20Giannini.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mega-deltas" in Asia, Africa, and small islands are at high risk of floods and storms, which will cause large-scale displacement of the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/displacement-caused-by-the-effects-of-climate-change-who-will-be-affected-and-what-are-the-gaps-in-the-normative-framework-for-their-protection/|title=Displacement Caused by the Effects of Climate Change: Who Will Be Affected and What Are the Gaps in the Normative Framework for Their Protection? {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change induced migration will either affect or violate basic international human right norms.

=== Climate justice ===
There is significant discussion around the concept of climate justice for the [[environmental migrant]] or 'climate refugee'. This concept aims to fill a gap in the legal and political sectors for the millions of people that are not able to receive international legal protection as this source of migration is yet to be included in regional and international law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987699915|title=Climate change, migration and human rights law and policy perspectives|others=Manou, Dimitra,, Baldwin, Andrew, 1970-, Cubie, Dug,, Mihr, Anja, 1969-, Thorp, Teresa M., 1968-|isbn=9781317222330|location=London|oclc=987699915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no established definition for who can be classified as a climate refugee because it has not yet been enshrined in international law. In 2014 Siego Alesana left the [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing state]] of [[Tuvalu]] because of the uncertainty surrounding the adverse effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=AD (Tuvalu )|date=4 June 2014|url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZIPT/2014/501370.html?query=AD%20(Tuvalu)|issue=501370|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu is only 4.6m above sea level and faces the imminent danger posed by rising sea levels. Although the impacts of climate change were put forward on behalf of Alesana and his family, the case rested largely on humanitarian grounds. However the [[Immigration and Protection Tribunal]] did state that environmental degradation caused by climate change was already a feature of life in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this decision wasn't based on impacts of climate change that is not to say that climate change related factors weren't taken into consideration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vernonrive.com/home/climate-refugees-revisited-a-closer-look-at-the-tuvalu-decision|title="Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision|website=Vernon Rive|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] has put forward a working definition of environmental migrant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/definitional-issues|title=Definitional Issues|date=2015-01-29|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Until there is a legally binding definition of what constitutes an environmental migrant, it will be difficult for any true justice to be served. The concept of climate justice would see all human rights implemented in the most transparent way in order to maintain basic standards in the face of the somewhat unknown impacts that will be created by climate change.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conflict===
International peacebuilding NGO [[International Alert]] names 46 countries where climate change effects (including water scarcity, loss of arable land, extreme weather events, shortened growing seasons, and melting glaciers) may interact with economic, social, and political forces to create "a high risk of violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dan|author2=Janani Vivekananda|title=A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT: The links between climate change, peace and war|journal=International Alert|date=November 2007|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/A_climate_of_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[Indigenous peoples]] have a unique position when it comes to discussion of the impacts climate change will have on a population. Many indigenous populations live subsistence lifestyles, which in turn are disrupted severely when it comes to the impact of climate change. In many countries, municipal law differs in application to indigenous peoples than the rest of the population which complicates any legal remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811732784|title=Climate change and Indigenous peoples : the search for legal remedies|date=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar|others=Abate, Randall., Kronk, Elizabeth Ann.|isbn=9781783474172|location=Cheltenham, UK|oclc=811732784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change impacts indigenous peoples differently not only because of their physical and spiritual connections to the land and water, but also because they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge that can be used to find the best mitigation strategy of those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Emily|date=2008|title=Climate change and human rights : issues and opportunities for Indigenous peoples|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Human Rights organs have identified the [[rights of indigenous peoples]] as particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: Climate change and indigenous peoples, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ClimateChangeIP.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampson|first=Françoise|title=THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN STATES AND TERRITORIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS|date=13 July 2004|issue=E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/WG/crp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate change, indigenous people have been threatened with their livelihood and cultural idententies across the world North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Approximately 370 million indigenous people are affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jay|date=2012-05-01|title=The impact of climate change on indigenous people – the implications for the cultural, spiritual, economic and legal rights of indigenous people|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=16|issue=4|pages=648–688|doi=10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|issn=1364-2987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child Rights===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identified that children in South Asia may be particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights following climate related disasters. These can include gender-based violence, child labour, family break-ups and barriers to their development and learning. The researchers argue that [[child rights]] are rarely prioritised in policies to reduce disaster risk or adapt to climate change and that [[climate change adaptation]] policies must tailor interventions to address critical aspects of child rights, particularly child protection and education.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris and Kelly Hawrylyshyn, Climate extremes and child rights in South Asia: a neglected priority, http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Given that many of the world's poorest citizens depend directly on the environment for all or part of their daily livelihoods, many international development agencies see climate change and development as "inextricably linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Agency for International Development|title=Integrating Climate Change into Development|date=November 2008|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACM036.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|author2=The World Bank|title=DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group|year=2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCC/Resources/407863-1219339233881/DCCSFTechnicalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khoday|first=Kishan|title=Climate Change and the Right to Development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14942">'''Iconology''' is a method of interpretation in cultural history and the history of art used by [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]] and their followers that uncovers the cultural, social, and historical background of themes and subjects in the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is derived from synthesis rather than scattered analysis and examines symbolic meaning on more than its face value by reconciling it with its historical context and with the artist's body of work&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biddingtons.com/content/pedigreeicon.html Iconography and Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; in contrast to the widely descriptive [[iconography]], which, as described by Panofsky, is an approach to studying the content and meaning of works of art that is primarily focused on classifying, establishing dates, provenance and other necessary fundamental knowledge concerning the subject matter of an artwork that is needed for further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Panofsky strongly differentiated between iconology and iconography, the distinction is not very widely followed, "and they have never been given definitions accepted by all iconographers and iconologists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few 21st-century authors continue to use the term consistently.

It should also be noted that Panofsky's "use of iconology as the principle tool of art analysis brought him critics." For instance, in 1946, [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]] "criticized Panofsky's iconology as putting too much emphasis on the symbolic content of the work of art, neglecting its formal aspects and the work as a unity of form and content."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistorians.info/panofskye Dictionary of Art Historians: Panofsky, Erwin]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, iconology is mostly avoided by social historians who do not accept the theoretical dogmaticism in the work of Panofsky.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von Beyme, "Why is there no Political Science of the Arts?" In Udo J. Hebel and Christoph Wagner, eds., ''Pictorial Cultures and Political Iconographies: Approaches, Perspectives, Case Studies from Europe and America''. Berlin and New York 2011, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contrast to iconography==
Erwin Panofsky defines iconography as "a known principle in the known world", while iconology is "an iconography turned interpretive".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tudor, ''Image and Influence: Studies in the Sociology of Film''. New York 1974, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his view, iconology tries to reveal the underlying principles that form the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious or philosophical perspective, which is modulated by one personality and condensed into one work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roelof van Straten, iconology "can explain why an artist or patron chose a particular subject at a specific location and time and represented it in a certain way. An iconological investigation should concentrate on the social-historical, not art-historical, influences and values that the artist might not have consciously brought into play but are nevertheless present. The artwork is primarily seen as a document of its time."&lt;ref&gt;Roelof van Straten, ''An Introduction to Iconography: Symbols, Allusions and Meaning in the Visual Arts''. Abingdon and New York 1994, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warburg used the term "iconography" in his early research, replacing it in 1908 with "iconology" in his particular method of visual interpretation called "critical iconology", which focused on the tracing of motifs through different cultures and visual forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hatt]] and Charlotte Klonk, "Iconography - iconology: Erwin Panofsky". In ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to Its Methods''. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Panofsky published a seminal article, introducing a three-step method of visual interpretation dealing with (1) primary or natural subject matter; (2) secondary or conventional subject matter, i.e. iconography; (3) tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content, i.e. iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Zum Problem der Beschreibung und Inhaltsdeutung von Werken der bildenden Kunst." ''Logos'', Vol. 21 (1932), pp. 103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas iconography analyses the world of images, stories and allegories and requires knowledge of literary sources, an understanding of the history of types and how themes and concepts were expressed by objects and events under different historical conditions, iconology interprets intrinsic meaning or content and the world of symbolical values by using "synthetic intuition". The interpreter is aware of the essential tendencies of the human mind as conditioned by psychology and world view; he analyses the history of cultural symptoms or symbols, or how tendencies of the human mind were expressed by specific themes due to different historical conditions. Moreover, when understanding the work of art as a document of a specific civilization, or of a certain religious attitude therein, the work of art becomes a symptom of something else, which expresses itself in a variety of other symptoms. Interpreting these symbolical values, which can be unknown to, or different from, the artist's intention, is the object of iconology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ljunggren Szepessy, "Panofsky - Iconology and Iconography". In ''The Marriage Maker: The Pergamon Hermaphrodite as the God Hermaphroditos, Divine Ideal and Erotic Object''. MA thesis, University of Oslo 2014, pp.13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panofsky emphasized that "iconology can be done when there are no originals to look at and nothing but artificial light to work in."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ann Holly, ''Panofsky and the Foundations of Art History''. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1984, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernst Gombrich]], "the emerging discipline of iconology ... must ultimately do for the image what linguistics has done for the word."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''Reflections on the History of Art: Views and Reviews'', ed. Richard Woodfield. Oxford 1987, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Camille]] is of the opinion that "though Panofsky's concept of iconology has been very influential in the humanities and is quite effective when applied to Renaissance art, it is still problematic when applied to art from periods before and after."&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.arizona.edu/downloads/Garcia,_Dominique_Writing_Sample.pdf Dominique E. Garcia, "Nationalistic Iconography and 'Anti-Iconology' of the Aztec Coatlicue Sculpture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuances==
In 1952, [[Creighton Gilbert]] added another opinion about the meaning of the word "iconology". According to his view, iconology was not the actual investigation of the work of art but rather the result of this investigation. The Austrian art historian [[Hans Sedlmayr]] differentiated between "sachliche" and "methodische" iconology. "Sachliche" iconology refers to the "general meaning of an individual painting or of an artistic complex (church, palace, monument) as seen and explained with reference to the ideas which take shape in them." In contrast, "methodische" iconology is the "integral iconography which accounts for the changes and development in the representations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3407705539/iconology-and-iconography.html Encyclopedia.com: Iconology and Iconography]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology'' (1986), [[W.J.T. Mitchell]] writes that iconology is a study of "what to say about images", concerned with the description and interpretation of visual art, and also a study of "what images say" – the ways in which they seem to speak for themselves by persuading, telling stories, or describing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconictheory.blogspot.de/2010/05/iconology.html Karen Hope, The Iconic Image: Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt; He pleads for a postlinguistic, postsemiotic "iconic turn", emphasizing the role of "non-linguistic symbol systems".&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, ''Iconology: Images, Text, Ideology''. University of Chicago Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-sites.net/english/mitchell.htm w.j.t. mitchell and the image (review)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J.T. Mitchell, "Iconology and Ideology: Panofsky, Althusser, and the Scene of Recognition". In David B. Downing and Susan Bazargan, eds., ''Image and Ideology in Modern/Postmodern Discourse''. New York 1991, pp.321-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of just pointing out the difference between the material (pictorial or artistic) images, "he pays attention to the dialectic relationship between material images and mental images".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ksangmin.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/w-j-t-mitchell-iconology-and-picture-theory/ W. J. T. Mitchell's Iconology and Picture Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, the term "iconology" can also be used for characterizing "a movement toward seeing connections across all the language processes" and the idea about "multiple levels and forms used to communicate meaning" in order to get "the total picture” of learning. "Being both literate in the traditional sense and visually literate are the true mark of a well-educated human."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol8/bartelo_morton.pdf Dennise Bartelo and Robert Morton, "Iconology: An Alternate Form of Writing"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, new approaches to iconology have developed in the theory of images. This is the case of what [[Jean-Michel Durafour]], French philosopher and theorist of cinema, proposed to call "econology", a biological approach to images as forms of life, crossing iconology, ecology and sciences of nature. In an econological regime, the image (''eikon'') self-speciates, that is to say, it self-iconicizes with others and eco-iconicizes with them its iconic habitat (''oikos''). The iconology, mainly Warburghian iconology, is thus merged with a conception of the relations between the beings of the nature inherited, among others ([[Arne Næss]], etc.) from the writings of [[Kinji Imanishi]]. For Imanishi, living beings are subjects. Or, more precisely, the environment and the living being are juste one. One of the main consequences is that the "specity", the living individual, "self-eco-speciates its place of life" (''Freedom in Evolution''). As far as the images are concerned: "If the living species self-specify, the images self-iconicize. This is not a tautology. The images update some of their iconic virtualities. They live in the midst of other images, past or present, but also future (those are only human classifications), which they have relations with. They self-iconicize in an iconic environment which they interact with, and which in particular makes them the images they are. Or more precisely, insofar as images have an active part: ''the images self-eco-iconicize their iconic environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Durafour, ''"L'Étrange Créature du lac noir" de Jack Arnold. Aubades pour une zoologie des images'', Aix-en-Provence, Rouge profond, 2017, 200 p. ({{ISBN|978-2915083910}}), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Studies in iconology==
''Studies in Iconology'' is the title of a book by Erwin Panofsky on humanistic themes in the art of the Renaissance, which was first published in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a peer-reviewed series of books started in 2014 under the editorship of [[Barbara Baert]] and published by Peeters international academic publishers, [[Leuven]], Belgium, addressing the deeper meaning of the visual medium throughout human history in the fields of philosophy, art history, theology and cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be/search_serie_book.asp?nr=284 Peeters Publishers: Studies in Iconology]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leisure studies''' is a branch of the [[social sciences]] that focuses on understanding and analyzing [[leisure]]. [[Recreation]] and [[tourism]] are common topics of leisure research.

The [[National Recreation and Park Association]] is the national organization in the United States for leisure studies, and offers [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] to many universities to offer courses of study ([[Academic degree|degree]] programs) in leisure studies.

The ''Journal of Leisure Research''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr|title=Journal of Leisure Research|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'' are some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilderdom.com/journals/journalsRecreation&amp;Leisure.htm|title=Peer-reviewed Journals in Recreation &amp; Leisure Studies|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly US [[academic journal]]s of leisure studies.



==History==

While leisure studies has existed for much longer, a first centralized organization for directing leisure studies was established in [[Birmingham, England]], in May 1975, and is known as the Leisure Studies Association. In 1984, the first international conference was held by the LSA at the [[University of Sussex]] in Brighton, which also set the record as the largest LSA event held to date with over 275 attendees. LSA conferences are widely regarded as some of the most attended events for leisure researchers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leisurestudies.org/history-of-lsa|title=ORIGINS OF LSA - Leisure Studies Association|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pursuing a degree in leisure studies will give students the opportunity to learn how to incorporate leisure into recreational activities and [[tourism]]. Students take a wide variety of classes ranging from [[psychology]] and [[social sciences]] to [[biology]] and [[anatomy]]. Students learn how to improve and foster a healthy life through leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinedegrees.org/degrees/leisure-studies/|title=Leisure Studies Degrees|work=Online Degrees|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leisure activities==
The leisure activities that people who work in leisure studies deal with include a very broad range of activities. Most of the activities can be separated into 3 sub-categories: sport and recreation, tourism, and leisure.
[[Sport]] and [[recreation]] activities is one of the broadest categories in leisure studies. This includes sports, both traditional and non-traditional, and any indoor or outdoor physical activities done for recreational purposes. Sport and recreation activities includes, but is not limited to, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[running]], [[hiking]], [[weight training|weight lifting]], [[playing]] [[games]] and other [[outdoor recreation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/parks-recreation-fitness-parks-recreation-leisure-studiesM|title=Big Future by The College Board|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tourism]] describes the traveling for leisure purposes. Destinations include [[public parks|parks]] and [[national parks]], [[hiking|hikes]], and domestic and foreign [[city|cities]].

All other activities that are not considered to be a part of sport and recreation or tourism are included general leisure activities. This category is quite vast, and includes, but are not limited to, [[yoga]], [[the arts]], [[nature conservation]], and other hobbies.&lt;ref name="csulb.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.csulb.edu/monographs/cohhs_recreatio.html|title=Careers Profiles|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career opportunities==

'''Ludomusicology''' (also called '''video game music studies''' or '''video game music research''') is a field of academic research and scholarly analysis focusing on  [[video game music]], understood as the music found in [[video game]]s and in related contexts. It is closely related to the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Sound effect#Video games|interactive and games audio research]], and game music and audio are sometimes studied as a united phenomenon. Ludomusicology is also related to the field of [[game studies]], as music is one element of the wider video game text and some theories on video game functions are directly relevant to music.

Whereas the overarching areas of interactive and game audio research and game studies are highly interdisciplinary (ranging from [[Interface (computing)|interface]] research, [[Neurology|neurological research]], [[psychology]] and [[informatics]] to [[sound studies]], [[cultural studies]] and [[media studies]]), ludomusicology as a subfield has been mainly driven by musicologists (albeit with an openness to interdisciplinary inquiry). Ludomusicology not only deals with music in games and music games as its subject matter, but is also interested in the ways in which games and their music have become subjects of playful engagement themselves, e.g. within the frame of fancultural practices. Additionally and more generally, game music challenges the ways in which we think about music, and subsequently how we study it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Elferen|first1=Isabella|title=Ludomusicology and the new drastic (Conference paper, unpublished)|journal=Creativity, Circulation and Copyright: Sonic and Visual Media in the Digital Age|date=28–29 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|title=Playing Games with Music (and Vice Versa): Ludomusicological Perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of anthologies and monographs dealing with the specific subject of game music and music in game culture is steadily increasing. The ludomusicological community now organizes conferences, runs subgroups within the musicological societies, and engages in discourse with scholarly colleagues in a wide range of related fields.

==History==
Academic research on video game music began in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matthew|first1=Belinkie|title=Video game music: not just kid stuff|url=http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|website=Videogame Music Archive|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613143431/http://www.vgmusic.com/vgpaper.shtml|archivedate=16 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed through the mid 2000s. Early research on the topic often involved historical studies of game music, or comparative studies of video game music and film music (see, for instance, Zach Whalen's article "Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music" which includes both).&lt;ref name="whalen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whalen|first1=Zach|date=November 2004|title=Play Along - An Approach to Videogame Music|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0401/whalen/|journal=Game Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of video game music is also known by some as "ludomusicology" — a portmanteau of "[[ludology]]" (the study of games and gameplay) and "[[musicology]]" (the study and analysis of music) — a term coined independently by Guillaume Laroche and Roger Moseley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moseley|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Cook|editor1-first=Nicholas|editor2-last=Pettengill|editor2-first=Richard|title=Taking it to the bridge: music as performance|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan Press|pages=283, 308|chapter=Playing games with music (and vice versa): ludomusicological perspectives on Guitar Hero and Rock Band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karbani|first1=Tasneem|title=Summer research project was music to student's ears|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~publicas/folio/45/01/04.html|website=University of Alberta|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent figure in early video game music and audio research is Karen Collins, who is associate professor at the [[University of Waterloo]] and Canada Research Chair in Interactive Audio at the University of Waterloo Games Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karen Collins|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/english/people-profiles/karen-collins|website=University of Waterloo|accessdate=2 May 2017|date=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her monograph ''Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design'' (MIT Press 2008)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Sound: An Introduction to the History, Theory and Practice of Video Game Music and Sound Design|last1=Collins|first1=Karen|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262033787|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a seminal work in the field, and was influential in the subsequent development of video game music studies.

In 2012, the Ludomusicology Research Group held its inaugural conference at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was the first conference in the world to be focused specifically on video game music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014 the inaugural North American Conference on Video Game Music was held at [[Youngstown State University]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both conferences have since been held annually, at varying locations in Europe and North America respectively.

In late 2016, the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg" /&gt; The SSSMG is the first international society dedicated to the study of video game music. In September 2017, the SSSMG announced the planned launch of a new journal dedicated to video game music and sound research, the ''Journal of Sound &amp; Music in Games''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/2017/09/04/announcement/|title=SSSMG Executive Committee Appointments &amp; Journal Announcement|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|date=4 September 2017|website=SSSMG|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of enquiry==
Ludomusicology examines any and all aspects of video game music and audio, some of which are described in brief here.

===Interactivity===
{{see also|Interactivity}}
Interactivity is one of the major differentiating qualities of video game music, distinguishing it from other screen media music through the incorporation of player actions. In interactive gameplay, the sound and music played by the game can respond to the actions of the player within the game.&lt;ref name="whalen" /&gt; Furthermore, as video games frequently feature non-linear or multi-linear timelines, their music can be similarly multi-threaded in both its form and its experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} Because each player takes an independently-chosen path through the game, any player’s experience of a game's music will be different (considered as a whole) to any other player's experience from the same game, even though constructed from the same basic elements. Therefore, the intent and output of the composer and the music's effect on the player (which similarly varies from player to player) must both be considered during analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Iain|title=Meaningful Play: Performativity, Interactivity and Semiotics in Video Game Music|journal=Musicology Australia|date=2014|volume=36|issue=2|pages=273–290|doi=10.1080/08145857.2014.958272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept to that of interactivity is that of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]], which considers the ability of a video game to draw the player into a deep engagement with the game's diegetic space. Isabella van Elferen has developed a model of video game music immersion called "the ALI model", which understands player immersion to be a confluence of "musical affect, musical literacy and musical interaction":
* Affect: "personal investment in a given situation through memory, emotion and identification"
* Literacy: "fluency in hearing and interpreting... music through the fact of our frequent exposure to [it]", which builds on such literacy from other musical media
* Interaction: the player's reactions to music, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Isabella|first=van Elferen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=34–39|chapter=Analysing Game Musical Immersion: The ALI Model|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{see also|Video game music|Chiptune}}
Historical studies of video game music usually incorporate examinations of game music technology. Technological limitations of audio chips in early consoles and computer systems were, in many ways, instrumental in shaping the development of both the functions and aesthetics of game music. For example, Karen Collins describes how the [[Television Interface Adaptor|Television Interface Adapter]] in the [[Atari 2600]] created tones that could be out of tune by up to half a semitone; this led to minimal music in games for this platform, and substantial modifications to the music of ported games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|21–23}} Similarly, Melanie Fritsch observes the relative freedoms afforded to game composers by [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]] (higher quality, though limited to 79.8 minutes) and later [[MP3]] (similar quality to CD audio but with compression minimising length restrictions), while also noting the challenges presented by writing increasingly detailed music to accompany hundreds of hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Fritsch|first=Melanie|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=24–25|chapter=History of Video Game Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another technology that has attracted significant academic attention is [[iMUSE]], a [[MIDI]]-based system developed by [[LucasArts]] that allowed dynamic and smooth musical transitions, which were triggered by game conditions but which would occur at musically expedient (pre-designated) positions in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51–57}}

Ludomusicology also investigates muso-technological practices in fields surrounding video games. For example, scholarly attention is turning to [[chiptune]], which is the creation of music using old video game or sound chip hardware (a definition which is sometimes broadened to include the imitation of the resulting aesthetic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Pasdzierny|first=Matthias|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=174–175|chapter=Geeks on Stage? Investigations in the World of (Live) Chipmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
{{see also|Video game music}}
Ludomusicology examines the composition of video game music, both in relation to and as distinct from other forms of [[Musical composition|music composition]]. Studies of game music compositional processes are often contributed by active [[composer]]s and industry practitioners (for example, [[Winifred Phillips]]'s book ''A Composer's Guide to Game Music'', and [[Stephen Baysted]]'s chapter "Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' ''Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed''").&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Composer's Guide to Game Music|last=Phillips|first=Winifred|publisher=MIT Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|last=Baysted|first=Stephen|publisher=Equinox|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Kamp|editor-first=Michiel|location=Sheffield|pages=152–171|chapter=Palimpsest, Pragmatism and the Aesthetics of Genre Transformation: Composing the Hybrid Score to Electronic Arts' Need for Speed Shift 2: Unleashed|editor-last2=Summers|editor-first2=Tim|editor-last3=Sweeney|editor-first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction of video game music composition is the need to incorporate the player's interactivity into the compositional process, and particularly as part of the negotiation of engagement and immersion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|35–36}} Composition is also at the nexus of creative potential and technological possibility, and throughout the development of game music (and particularly in its early phases) this has had significant effects on both compositional processes and game music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|35}}

===Music video games===
{{see also|Music video game}}
Music video games, which use music as part of a dominant gameplay mechanism, are a focus of many ludomusicological studies. The clear relationship between music and gameplay in games like the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' series facilitates the study of performance and performativity within gameplay, and provokes questions of musical ideology, performance practice and multimedia pedagogy. Kiri Miller writes that music video games feature a smaller disparity between the actions of player and avatar than is usually present in video games, and that this can encourage heightened levels of physical and musical engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Playing Along: Digital Games, YouTube, and Virtual Performance|last=Miller|first=Kiri|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Roesner, Anna Paisley, and Gianna Cassidy have examined these phenomena within the classroom context, observing that music video games can inspire not only musical creativity, but the positive self-perception of musicality in students; they suggest that such effects can be used to encourage student engagement and development within both musical and non-musical curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music Video Games: Performance, Politics, and Play|last=Roesner|first=David|last2=Paisley|first2=Anna|last3=Cassidy|first3=Gianna|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Austin|editor-first=Michael|location=New York|pages=213–215|chapter=Guitar Heroes in the Classroom: The Creative Potential of Music Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to music in other screen media===
{{see also|Soundtrack|Film score}}
Because video games are (usually) screen-based media, there are strong links between the study of game music and the study of music in other screen-based media (like film and television). Concepts such as [[Diegesis#In film|diegesis]] and [[Acousmatic sound|acousmatics]], which originate in film and film audio studies, are broadly applicable to video game music analyses, often with minimal adjustment.&lt;ref name=whalen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medina-Gray|first1=Elizabeth|editor1-last=Donnelly|editor1-first=K.J.|editor2-last=Gibbons|editor2-first=William|editor3-last=Lerner|editor3-first=Neil|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=Meaningful Modular Combinations: Simultaneous Harp and Environmental Music in two ''Legend of Zelda'' Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are similarities between video game and film music techniques as varying stages throughout video game music history. For example, Neil Lerner notes a relationship between music in [[Silent film|early/silent cinema]] and game music aesthetics from the 1970s onwards, on the basis of "largely nonverbal communication system[s]" and "continuous musical accompaniment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music in Video Games: Studying Play|last=Lerner|first=Neil|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|editor-last=Donnelly|editor-first=K.J.|location=New York|pages=12|chapter=Mario's Dynamic Leaps: Musical Innovations (and the Specter of Early Cinema) in ''Donkey Kong'' and ''Super Mario Bros.''|editor-last2=Gibbons|editor-first2=William|editor-last3=Lerner|editor-first3=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Gregor Herzfeld compares the use of high energy music in ''[[Gran Turismo (video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' to the use of rock music in action films like ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', due to associations with risky and/or exciting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Game: Perspectives on a Popular Alliance|last=Herzfeld|first=Gregor|publisher=Springer VS|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Moormann|editor-first=Peter|location=Wiesbaden|pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also well noted within ludomusicological discourse that video games are very different media to film and television due to the player's interaction. Consequently, the application of concepts like diegesis does require a nuanced approach that takes the peculiarities of the video game medium into account. For example, Collins observes that linear approaches to [[musical analysis]] (such as the observation of synchronicity between musical and visual cues) fail to address the non-linear timescales that are typical of video games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3–4}} This forms a basis of Collins's reiteration of a warning by video game theorists against "theoretical imperialism".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|5}}

===Research methods===
Several academics have written about the research methods involved in ludomusicology. One of the more comprehensive of these studies is found in Tim Summers's book ''Understanding Video Game Music'', in which Summers describes the process of "analytical play", wherein the analyst is "deliberately subverting the game's expectations of the player's actions.... At moments when game rules are tested, the architecture is often clearest. By playing experimentally (or using 'analytical play') to investigate the musical system in the game and comparing multiple play sessions, the musical mechanics of the game programming can be divined".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|35}} Summers places this analytical method alongside more conventional sources of research data, both from inside the game (e.g., programmatic and musical information, the latter of which frequently involves the application of conventional musicology and music theory to the video game music text) and from texts and communities surrounding the game.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{Rp|34–50}}

==Groups and Conferences==

===Ludomusicology Research Group===
The Ludomusicology Research Group is an inter-university research organisation focusing on the study of music in games, music games and music in video game culture, composed of four researchers: Michiel Kamp, Tim Summers, Melanie Fritsch, and Mark Sweeney.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/about/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they organise an annual international conference held in the UK or Europe (at the time of writing, the most recent was the Ludo2017 conference held at Bath Spa University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludo 2017|url=http://www.ludomusicology.org/past-events/ludo-2017/|website=Ludomusicology|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ludo2018 held in Leipzig, Germany, in April 2018, was the biggest Ludo-conference so far, attracting more than 80 participants from all over the world. The group was originally founded by Kamp, Summers and Sweeney in August 2011, who have also edited a collection of essays based around the study of game sound entitled ''Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music'', published in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kamp|editor1-first=Michiel|editor2-last=Summers|editor2-first=Tim|editor3-last=Sweeney|editor3-first=Mark|title=Ludomusicology: Approaches to Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Equinox|isbn=9781781791974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludomusicology|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/ludomusicology/|website=Equinox|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also edited a double special issue of [https://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2999/ ''The Soundtrack''] and initiated a new book series called [http://www.ludomusicology.org/2017/04/20/new-book-series-studies-game-sound-music/ ''Studies in Game Sound and Music''] in 2017. In September 2016, Tim Summers' book ''Understanding Video Game Music'' was published by Cambridge University Press.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Tim|title=Understanding Video Game Music|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107116870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritsch officially joined the group in 2016. She had edited the 2nd issue of the online journal [http://www.act.uni-bayreuth.de/en/archiv/2011-02/index.html ''ACT - Zeitschrift für Musik und Performance''], published in July 2011 that included ludomusicological contributions written by Tim Summers, Steven Reale and James Brame. She had been a regular at the conferences since 2012 and published several book chapters on the topic. Whereas Kamp, Summers and Sweeney have a background in Musicology, Fritsch has her background in Performance Studies. Her doctoral thesis and first monograph "Performing Bytes. Musikperformances der Computerspielkultur" is scheduled for publication during 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://uni-bayreuth.academia.edu/mfritsch&lt;/ref&gt;

===North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM)===
The North American Conference on Video Game Music (NACVGM) is an international conference on video game music held annually in North America since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, B. I. (2014, January 18). [https://www.wired.com/2014/01/game-music/  There Really Is a Conference Where Nerds Study Videogame Music.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Checkpoint!: The floodgates have opened.

===Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG)===
In late 2016 the Society for the Study of Sound and Music in Games (SSSMG) was launched by the Ludomusicology Research Group in conjunction with the organisers of the North American Conference on Video Game Music and the Audio Mostly conference.&lt;ref name="about-sssmg"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SSSMG|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/about-sssmg/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSSMG has the aim of bringing together both practitioners and researchers from across the globe in order to develop the field's understanding of sound and video game music and audio. Its initial focus is the use of its website as a "hub" for communication and resource centralisation, including a video game music research bibliography (a project initially begun by the Ludomusicology Research Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography|url=https://www.sssmg.org/wp/bibliography/|website=SSSMG|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMS Ludomusicology Study Group===
The Ludomusicology Study Group of the [[American Musicological Society]] was founded in 2015 and "is dedicated to facilitating academic research on music interactive media", including holding a panel on video game music as part of the annual meetings of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gamemusicstudies.org/?page_id=12|title=About|work=Ludomusicology Study Group|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ludomusicology Society of Australia (LSA)===
The Ludomusicology Society of Australia was launched in April 2017, during the Ludo2017 conference in Bath, UK; it aims to "offer a centralised and local professional body nurturing game music studies for academics, people in industry and game music fans alike in the Australasian region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The LSA is here!|url=http://ludomusicologysociety.com.au/2017/03/07/hello-world/|website=The Ludomusicology Society of Australia|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mandat International''', also known as the '''International Cooperation Foundation''', is an international [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with consultative status to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the [[UNDPI]], and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].

==Aims==
Mandat Internatioal aims to promote international dialogue and cooperation, including in the research domain. It promotes international law, data protection and sustainable development. It is strictly independent from any political or religious affiliation.

==Activities==
Mandat International is a foundation with public utility status, relying on a network of members covering the various fields of activity of international cooperation. It collaborates closely with most of the international organizations and is independent of any political or religious affiliation. Its first aim is is to promote international cooperation, including in the research domain. Its activities encompass various domains, from ICT research, to international law and privacy, multistakeholder dialogue and international research projects. Over time, the foundation has developed many projects, including several international research projects, international conferences and events, support to over 10’000 delegates for attending international conferences, educational programes, creating the Eduki foundation, legal search engines, conferences, etc. The foundation usually supports projects for a limited period of time but with the objective to have a sustainable impact. When its objectives are achieved it usually pioneers and addresses new emerging challenges.

The current focus of the foundation is on promoting international cooperation with the research community, developing international research projects, supporting technology transfer from the ressearch community to standardization and international organizations, and promoting international law. The foundation is also actively engaged in the Internet of Things domain to promote international cooperation and dissemination, in line with the International Declaration on Internet of Things for Sustainable Development adopted by the IoT Forum and the ITU.

The discipline of '''medical entomology''', or '''public health entomology''', and also ''veterinary entomology'' is focused upon [[insect]]s and [[arthropod]]s that impact human health. Veterinary entomology is included in this category, because many animal diseases can "jump species" and become a human health threat, for example, bovine encephalitis. Medical entomology also includes scientific research on the behavior, ecology, and [[epidemiology]] of arthropod disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], and involves a tremendous outreach to the public, including local and state officials and other stake holders in the interest of public safety, finally in current situation related to one health approach mostly health policy makers recommends to widely applicability of medical entomology for disease control efficient and best fit on achieving development goal and to tackle the newly budding zoonotic diseases. Thoughtful to have and acquaint with best practice of Med. Entomologist to tackle the animal and public health issues together with controlling arthropods born diseases by having Medical Entomologists’ the right hand for bringing the healthy world [Yon w]. 
[[File:US Navy 100506-N-7498L-189 Lt. Brian Heintschel studies a sample of insects collected from ships and shore facilities.jpg|thumb|230px|left|A U.S. Navy medical entomologist identifying insects]]
Medical Entomologists are employed by private and public universities, private industries, and federal, state, and local government agencies, including [http://www.afpmb.org/content/dod-entomology all three branches of the US military] - who hire medical entomologists to protect the troops from infectious diseases that can be transmitted by arthropods. Historically, during wars, more people have died due to insect-transmitted diseases, than to all the battle injuries combined.

Medical entomologists are also hired by chemical companies - to help develop new pesticides which will effectively decrease insect pest populations while simultaneously protecting the health of the public.

Public health entomology has seen a huge surge in interest since 2005, due to the resurgence of the bed bug, ''Cimex lectularius.''

==Insects of medical importance==
There are many insects (and other arthropods) that affect human health. These arthropods include ''[[Diptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Thysanoptera]], [[Phthiraptera]], and [[Siphonaptera]].'' They can parasitize, bite, sting, cause allergic reactions, and/or vector disease to humans. Though it can be impossible to know the full impact that insects and other arthropods have on human health, Medical Entomologists worldwide are working to combat the known effects in order to improve public health.

==Personal Pests==
Personal pests such as [[Lice]], [[Fleas]], [[Bed bug (insect)|Bedbugs]], [[Ticks]], [[Scabies|Scabies mites]], may vector pathogens. They are [[hematophagous]], meaning they feed on the blood of their host. Nearly all personal pests can be transmitted to an uninfected host with prolonged exposure to an infected host. Lice, fleas, bedbugs, and ticks are known as [[Parasitic nutrition#Ectoparasitism|ectoparasites]]. Ectoparasites live on the skin of their host. They have adaptations that allow them to access the nutrients inside of the host, such as methods to penetrate skin, insert digestive enzymes and a gut microbiome that can digest the nutrients received from the host&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vingerhoets|first=Ad|date=2001-06|title=An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (2nd ed.), Edited by Randy J. Nelson, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland MA, 2000. ISBN: 0-87893-616-5 (pkb.). 724 pp.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0301-0511(01)00068-0|journal=Biological Psychology|volume=56|issue=2|pages=171–172|doi=10.1016/s0301-0511(01)00068-0|issn=0301-0511}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While these ectoparasites feed, the transfer of fluids may transmit diseases such as typhus, plague, and Lyme disease. It is also suspected that bedbugs may also be vectors of hepatitis B&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vector Control - Methods for Use by Individuals and Communities.|publisher=World Health Organization|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=237-261}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Scabies|Scabies mites]] cannot be classified as ectoparasites. The mite that causes scabies, ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei|Sarcoptes scabei]]'' also known as the itch mite, burrows into the skin of its host making it an [[endoparasite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alpfmedical.info/parasites/endoparasitic-mites.html|title=Endoparasitic mites - Parasites - ALPF Medical Research|website=www.alpfmedical.info|language=en|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The act of ''S. scabei'' living in the skin and the allergic response to the parasite is the condition known as scabies.

==The Housefly==

The [[housefly]] is a very common and cosmopolitan species which transmits diseases to man. The organisms of both amoebic and bacillary [[Dysentery|dysenteries]] are picked up by flies from the faeces of infected people and transferred to clean food either on the fly's hairs or by the fly vomiting during feeding. [[Typhoid]] germs may be deposited on food with the fly's faeces. The house fly cause the spread of [[yaws]] germs by carrying them from a yaws ulcer to an ordinary sore. Houseflies also transmit [[poliomyelitis]] by carrying the virus from infected faeces to food or drink. [[Cholera]] and [[hepatitis]]  are sometimes fly-borne. Other diseases carried by houseflies are [[Salmonella]], [[tuberculosis]], [[anthrax]], and some forms of [[ophthalmia]]. They carry over 100 pathogens and transmit some parasitic worms. The flies in poorer and lower-hygiene areas usually carry more pathogens. Some strains have become immune to most common insecticides.

==The Cockroach==
[[Oriental cockroach|Cockroaches]] carry disease-causing organisms (typically [[gastroenteritis]]) as they forage. Cockroach excrement and cast skins also contain a number of [[allergens]] causing responses such as, watery eyes,skin rashes, congestion of nasal passages and asthma.

==Biting insects==

There are many insects that bite including [[Mosquitoes]], [[Culicoides|Biting Midges]], [[Sandflies]], [[Black flies]], [[Horse Flies]], [[Stable fly|Stable flies]]. Through feeding, insects or other arthropod vectors can transmit diseases to humans. Medical Entomologists and other medical professionals have helped to develop [[Vaccine|vaccines]] that can prevent humans from contracting some of those diseases. They have also developed ways to prevent the arthropods from biting humans. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2018, illnesses caused by insect bites have tripled from 2004 to 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0501-vs-vector-borne.html|title=Illnesses on the rise|date=2018-05-01|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66270">{{Politics}}
The connection between '''music and politics''', particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; Music can express [[anti-establishment]] or protest themes, including [[anti-war song]]s, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as [[topical song]]s.

Songs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label "political music" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161257/http://livingearth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CASE-STUDY-OF-MUSIC-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-ADVOCACY-AND-AWARENESS-RAISING.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way [[Western culture|Western]] pop/rock bands such as [[The Beatles]] were censored by the [[State (polity)|State]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/columns-blogs/new-voices/855-back-in-the-ussr |title=New Eastern Europe |website=Neweasterneurope.eu |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience,  reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues.&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt; For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that "counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers",&lt;ref name="Polpop"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=Political Pop, Political Fans?|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.103?view=text;rgn=main|publisher=Music &amp; Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that "It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically".

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that "given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities".&lt;ref name="Polpop"/&gt;

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, [[music education]] has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling [[patriotism]] in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive [[jingoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Plato wrote: "musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==

===American folk revival===
The song "[[We Shall Overcome]]" is perhaps the best-known example of political [[folk music]], in this case a rallying-cry for the [[US]] [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Pete Seeger]] was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was [[Joan Baez]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Noah|title=The History of 'We Shall Overcome'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1031839|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=15 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and [[class struggle]] lead to the growth of the [[Labour movement]] and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century "[[Wobblies]]" was [[Joe Hill]]. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the [[Almanac Singers]] and [[The Weavers]] were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. [[Woody Guthrie]]'s "This Land Is Your Land" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's [[socialism|socialistic]] patriotism.&lt;ref name="Folk Hero"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hajdu|first=David|title=Review: Folk Hero|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/29/040329crbo_books?currentPage=1.|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=29 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Seeger's "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", was a popular anti-war [[protest song]].&lt;ref name="Pete Seeger"&gt;{{cite web|last=PBS|title=The Power of Song|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/pete-seeger/the-power-of-song/50/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", by [[Bob Dylan]], was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-political-bob-dylan |title=The Political Bob Dylan |publisher=Dissent Magazine |date=2016-11-13 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK&lt;ref name="Top Hits 1965"&gt;{{cite web|title=Favorites in the UK 1965|url=http://www.severing.nu/music/1965UK.html|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]" (by [[Phil Ochs]]); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies.&lt;ref name=Unterberger&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=There But for Fortune|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/there-but-for-fortune-t1020598|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]] of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/philochs2.html |title=Perfect Sound Forever: Phil Ochs |website=Furious.com |date=1976-04-09 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Paxton]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by [[Left-wing politics|Left]]-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as [[Sing Out!]] and [[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]. The revival began in the 1930s&lt;ref name="30s to 60s folk music revival"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eyerman and Barretta|first=Ron and Scott|title=From the 30s to the 60s: The folk music revival in the United States|url=http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/fb09/kunstpaed/indexweb/jukult/folk.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued after [[World War II]]. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists and artists such as [[Alan Lomax]], [[Lead Belly]] and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers.&lt;ref name=Reuss&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuss and Reuss|first=Richard and Joanne|title=American Folk Music and Left Wing Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EycS7FSTAyUC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=folk+topical+recordings+left+wing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y2GOBM-opV&amp;sig=oobIuBpQghNCnp3f2Al21JaMWj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rj1_T6jwI4Sk8gS09KjNBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=folk%20topical%20recordings%20left%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], [[Ewan MacColl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewanmaccoll.co.uk/ewan-maccoll-biography/ |title=Ewan MacColl Biography |website=Ewanmaccoll.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A. L. Lloyd]] performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist&lt;ref&gt;Lee, CP (2009), 'Like the night: Reception and reaction, Dylan's 1966 UK tour', in: ''Highway 61 Revisited: Bob Dylan's Road From Minnesota To The World'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis USA, pp. 78-84.&lt;/ref&gt; and MacColl (often with [[Peggy Seeger]]) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their [[CPGB|Communist]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewan-maccoll.info/AlbumInfo.aspx?ID=239 |title=Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl - Songs Of Struggle |website=Ewan-maccoll.info |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Spencer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/25/ewan-maccoll-godfather-folk-adored-and-feared |title=Ewan MacColl: the godfather of folk who was adored – and feared &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Colin Irwin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/23/british-folk-music |title=The battle over British folk music &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the [[Cold War]] era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired.&lt;ref name="Cold War Gallup"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John|title=Seeing Red: The Cold War and American Public Opinion|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/foreign-policy/cold-war/conference/white.html|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, [[Earl Robinson]] and [[Irwin Silber]] were or had been members of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine [[New Masses]]), [[Lee Hays]] and [[Paul Robeson]] were considered [[Fellow travellers#McCarthyism|fellow travellers]]. As [[McCarthyism]] began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996 p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; Artists were blacklisted, denounced by [[House Committee on Un-American Activities#Standing committee|politicians]] and the media, and in the case of the 1949 [[Peekskill Riots]], subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by [[rock and roll]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=David|title=The Vietnam War and American Music|journal=Social Text|year=1989|pages=122–143|jstor=466424}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.&lt;ref&gt;30s to 60s folk music revival 1996, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blues and black American music===
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. [[Bessie Smith]] recorded protest song "Poor Man Blues" in 1928. [[Josh White]] recorded "When Am I Going to be Called a Man" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as "boy" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's ''Chain Gang'' and 1941's ''Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/joshprotest.html |title=Josh White and the Protest Blues, by Elijah Wald |website=Elijahwald.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead Belly's "Bourgeois Blues" and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]'s "Black, Brown and White" (aka "Get Back") protested racism. [[Billie Holiday]] recorded and popularised the song "[[Strange Fruit]]" in 1939. Written by Communist [[Lewis Allan]], and also recorded by Josh White and [[Nina Simone]], it addressed [[Southern United States|Southern]] racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including [[Madison Square Gardens]]. In the post-war era, [[J.B. Lenoir]] gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single "Eisenhower Blues" due to its title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Dahl |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jb-lenoir-mn0000115733/biography |title=J.B. Lenoir &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Schwachter |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vietnam-blues-the-complete-l-r-recording-mw0000178679 |title=Vietnam Blues: The Complete L&amp;R Recording - J.B.

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) for his outspoken [[Political views of Paul Robeson|political views]]. The [[State Department]] denied Robeson a passport and issued a "stop notice" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International [[Peace Arch]] on the border between [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state and the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] on May 18, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Duberman p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

[[Disco music|Disco]], contrary to popular opinion, originated in [[Black people|Black]] [[queer]] communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the [[Bronx]] and other parts of [[New York City|New York]]. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of "absorbing the feeling", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a "form of escape" and noted a "dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim ''Disco and the Queering of the Dance Floor.'', Cultural Studies, 25:2, 230-243, DOI: 10.1080/9502386.2011.535989&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to [[rock music]] from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gracias-a-la-vida-mw0000651422 |title=Gracias a la Vida - Joan Baez &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; album was a response to [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|events]] in [[Chile]] and included versions of songs by [[Nueva canción|Nueva Canción Chilena]] singer-songwriters [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Victor Jara]]. Paxton albums such as ''Outward Bound''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/outward-bound-mw0000785860 |title=Outward Bound - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Morning Again''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/morning-again-mw0000786225 |title=Morning Again - Tom Paxton &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as [[Holly Near]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hang-in-there-mw0000104473 |title=Hang in There - Holly Near &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Korona]], [[Charlie King (folksinger)|Charlie King]], [[Anne Feeney]], [[Jim Page (singer)|Jim Page]], [[Utah Phillips]] and more recently [[David Rovics]].

In [[Ireland]], the [[Wolfe Tones]] is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/[[irish rebel music|rebel music]] tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by [[Dominic Behan]] on albums such as ''[[Let the People Sing (Wolfe Tones album)|Let the People Sing]]'' and ''[[Rifles of the I.R.A.]]'' [[Christy Moore]] has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album ''[[Paddy on the Road]]'', produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as ''[[Ride On (Christy Moore album)|Ride On]]'' (including "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada (song)|Viva la Quinta Brigada]]"), ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' and various artists LP ''[[H Block]]'' to which Moore contributed "Ninety Miles from Dublin", in response to the [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] prisoners' [[blanket protest]] of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, [[The Barleycorn]] had held the [[List of number-one singles of 1972 (Ireland)|#1 spot on the Irish charts]] for five weeks in 1972 with their first release "[[The Men Behind the Wire]]", about [[Operation Demetrius|internment]], with all profits going to the families of internees; [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album ''Smash Internment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rol3002 |title=Vinyl Album - Various Artists - Smash Internment And Injustice - Live Recording In Long Kesh - R &amp; O - Ireland |website=45worlds.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in [[Long Kesh]], and The Wolfhounds' recording of [[Paddy McGuigan]]'s "[[The Boys of the Old Brigade]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/ro1001 |title=The Wolfhounds [Ireland&amp;#93; - The Boys Of The Old Brigade / Ashtown Road - R&amp;O - Ireland - RO.1001 |website=45cat.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. [[Hungary]], for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late [[Cold War]] era, which was reflected in much of their folk music.&lt;ref name="World Music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohlman|first=Philip|title=World Music: A Very Short Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late twentieth century [[folk music]] was crucial in [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;World Music 2002, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In Communist [[China]], exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent "re-education". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.&lt;ref&gt;''Folk Music of China'' (1995) by Stephen Jones, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of [[Edward Lansdale]], a [[CIA]] chief who dedicated part of his career to [[counter-insurgency]] in the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president [[Ramon Magsaysay]], an important [[US]] anti-communist ally.&lt;ref name="Folk Music"/&gt; In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as [[Phạm Duy]] to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the [[First Indochina war|anti-French struggle]] but then broke with the Communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]].&lt;ref name="Folk Music"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish|first=Lydia|title=General Edward G.

The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]],&lt;ref name="furious.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/marcus.html |title=Greil Marcus interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan,&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; itself shaped by the politicised [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as [[John Lennon]] commonly expressed protest themes in their music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/133778-revolutionary-man-john-lennon-as-political-artist/ |title=Revolutionary Man: John Lennon As Political Artist |publisher=PopMatters |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on the [[Plastic Ono Band]]'s 1969 single "[[Give Peace a Chance]]". Lennon later devoted [[Some Time in New York City|an entire album]] to politics and wrote the song [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]], widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
 
In 1962-63, [[Bob Dylan]] sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums "[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era.&lt;ref name="dissentmagazine.org"/&gt; In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the [[British Invasion]] bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.&lt;ref name="furious.com"/&gt;

The [[MC5]] (Motor City 5) came out of the [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] underground scene of the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/MC5/benedmonds.html |title=MC5- Ben Edmonds interview |website=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embodied an aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs "Motor City Is Burning", (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)]] to the [[12th Street riot|1967 12th Street Detroit Riot]]), and "American Ruse" (which discusses U.S. [[police brutality]] as well as [[pollution]], [[prison]], [[materialism]] and [[rebellion]]). They had ties to [[Far left|radical leftist]] groups such as [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]]. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], as part of the [[Yippie]]s' [[Festival of Life]] where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – [[List of songs about the Vietnam War|often in regard to the Vietnam War]] – include [[The Fugs]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]], while some bands, such as The Beatles, [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Hawkwind]], referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]", "[[Street Fighting Man]]", "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]" and "[[Urban Guerrilla]]".

===Punk rock===
{{Main article|Punk ideologies}}

Notable punk rock bands, such as [[Crass]], [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Refused]], [[American Standards]], [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Millions of Dead Cops|MDC]], [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Anti-Flag]], and [[Leftover Crack]] have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, [[punk rock]] has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/612/what-riot-punk-rock-politics-fascism-and-rock-against-racism|title=What Riot?

Punk's [[DIY culture]] held an attraction for some on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], suggesting affinity with the ideals of [[workers' control]], and empowerment of the powerless&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncarved.org/music/apunk/autonomia.html |title=Punk And Autonomia |website=Uncarved.org |date=1977-02-17 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though it is arguable that the punk movement's partial focus on apathy towards the establishment, combined with the fact that in many situations, punk rock music generated income for major record companies, and the notable similarities between some strains of anarchism and capitalism, meant that the punk movement ran contrary to left-wing ideologies) – and the genre as a whole came, largely through the [[Sex Pistols]], to be associated with anarchism. The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burchill and Parsons|first=Julie and Tony|title=The Boy Looked At Johnny|year=1978|publisher=[[Pluto Press]]|location=London|isbn=0-86104-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denselow|first=Robin|title=When The Music's Over|year=1989|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13906-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but bands such as [[Crass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/crass-mn0000129637/biography |title=Crass &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dead Kennedys]]&lt;ref name="DKs"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dead-kennedys-mn0000786613/biography |title=Dead Kennedys &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK [[anarcho-punk]] and US [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[subgenre]]s, respectively.

The Sex Pistols song "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" was banned from broadcast by the BBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/sex-pistols-mn0000418740/biography |title=Sex Pistols &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|1977]] due to its presumed anti-[[Royalism]], partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a "fascist regime". The following year, the release of debut Crass album [[The Feeding Of the 5000]] was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Grimes |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/a-history-of-music-censorship-9051887.html |title=A history of music censorship |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their [[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]] album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their [[Frankenchrist]] album artwork.&lt;ref name="DKs"/&gt;

[[The Clash]] are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or [[Political nihilism|nihilistic]] attack of many early punk bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Antonino D’Ambrosio |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2003/06/01/let-fury-have-the-hour-the-passionate-politics-of-joe-strummer |title='Let Fury Have the Hour': The Passionate Politics of Joe Strummer by Antonino D’Ambrosio |publisher=Monthly Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-clash-mn0000075747/biography |title=The Clash &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/[[new wave music|new wave]] bands such as [[The Jam]], [[The Ruts]], [[Stiff Little Fingers]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[Tom Robinson Band|TRB]] and [[Newtown Neurotics]], and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as [[White Riot|racial tension]], [[Career Opportunities (song)|unemployment]], [[Garageland (song)|class resentment]], [[London's Burning (The Clash song)|urban alienation]] and police violence, as well as [[I'm So Bored with the USA|imperialism]].

Many punk musicians, such as [[Vic Bondi]] ([[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]]), [[Joey Keithley]] ([[DOA (band)|DOA]]), [[Tim McIlrath]] ([[Rise Against]]), [[The Crucifucks]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Proletariat]], [[Against All Authority]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Crashdog]] have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer [[Jello Biafra]], as well as [[T.S.O.L.]] frontman [[Jack Grisham]], have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more [[Populism|populist]] and [[conservative]] opinions, and an ambiguous form of [[patriotism]], beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s [[New York hardcore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Damon Root |url=http://reason.com/blog/2009/12/08/the-politics-of-hardcore-punk |title=The Politics of Hardcore Punk - Hit &amp; Run |website=Reason.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the [[Oi!]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) [[Skrewdriver]] and [[Skullhead]], have held [[far-right politics|far-right]] and [[anticommunism|anti-communist]] stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

===Rock the Vote===
[[Rock the Vote]] is an American [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit]], [[non-partisan]] organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/rtv_about.php |title=About Rock the Vote |website=Rockthevote.com |date=1993-02-05 |accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote's stated mission is to "build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120930064408/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=ind_focus.story&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F12-19-2007%2F0004725469&amp;EDATE=WED+Dec+19+2007%2C+09%3A00+AM ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/message-bronx-history-rap-city-article-1.576580|title=MESSAGE FROM THE BRONX     THE HISTORY OF RAP IN THE CITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-50-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-20121205/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-the-message-19691231|title=50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2013/08/05/alex-abramovich/agitate-educate-organize/|title=Alex Abramovich: Agitate, Educate, Organize|first=Alex|last=Abramovich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade hip hop band [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] became "perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group"&lt;ref name="grio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2010/06/15/hip-hop-and-politics-have-a-long-history-behind-the-mic/|title=Hip-hop and politics have a long history behind the mic - theGrio|date=15 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a series of records whose message and success "directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|title=Public Enemy - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as [[X Clan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/x-clan-mn0000585601/biography|title=X Clan - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poor Righteous Teachers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poor-righteous-teachers-mn0000852698/biography|title=Poor Righteous Teachers - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brand Nubian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brand-nubian-mn0000933772/biography|title=Brand Nubian - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2 Black 2 Strong MMG|2 Black 2 Strong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/2-black-2-strong-mn0000899479/biography|title=2 Black 2 Strong - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/paris-mn0000003182/biography|title=Paris - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song [[Born This Way (song)]] has often been known as the international gay anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mo|first1=Jang|title=When Pop Music Meets A Political Issue: Examining How "Born This Way" Influences Attitudes Toward Gays And Gay Rights Policies.|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2014|volume=1|issue=58|pages=114–130|doi=10.1080/08838151.2013.875023}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of [[Hurricane Katrina]] received a great political response from the [[hip-hop|Hip hop music]] community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George|first1=Courtney|title=From Bounce To The Mainstream: Hip Hop Representations Of Post-Katrina New Orleans In Music, Film And Television.|journal=European Journal of American Culture|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1|pages=17–32|doi=10.1386/ejac.35.1.17_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist music==
{{Distinguish|Race music}}
Racist music or [[white power music]] is music associated with and promoting [[neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;''Intelligence Report'': a project of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], Issues 133-136; Southern Poverty Law Center, Klanwatch Project, Southern Poverty Law Center. Militia Task Force, Publisher Klanwatch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Musicology|musicologists]] point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Dominic J. Pulera, ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pages 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Contemporary white-supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Perry, ''Hate Crimes'', Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, 2009, pages 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'', Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rooney, ''Race Hate'', Evans Brothers, 2006, {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The news documentary ''[[VH1]] News Special: Inside Hate Rock'' (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is "a breeding ground for [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|home-grown terrorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Bianculli, [http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-02-18/entertainment/18189857_1_white-supremacist-eighth-letter-hate ''Vh1 Special Goes Behind The (racist) Music''], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', February 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched "Project Schoolyard" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, "We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Foxman, [http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/1997.cfm "Hate Music: New Recruitment Tool for White Supremacists"], ''Worldpress.org'', December 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Houghton, of the [[National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism]], said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, "Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120105013218/http://www.koco.com/r/3962764/detail.html "Record Label Targets Teens With Hate Message: Sampler CD Of White Power Music Circulating In Numerous U.S. Schools"], Ohio/Oklahoma Hearst Television Inc. on behalf of ''KOCO-TV'',  December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country music==
American [[country music]] contains numerous images of "[[tradition]]al" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as [[Merle Haggard]]'s "[[The Fightin' Side of Me]]", and "[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie from Muskogee]]" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an "us versus them" mentality directed at the [[counterculture]] "[[hippie]]s" and the [[anti-war]] crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill, "Country Music U.S.A," 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
[[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|third symphony]] was originally called "Bonaparte". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed "Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man".{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the "Risorgimento". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] of "romanticizing terrorists" in his opera ''[[The Death of Klinghoffer]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;article in the December 9, 2001, ''New York Times'' Arts and Leisure section&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--Exactly how does this accusation by Taruskin constitute a political stance--is it Taruskin, as a music critic, or is it Adams, who somehow is obviously guilty of the charge?--&gt;

===In the Soviet Union===
[[RAPM (association)|RAPM]] (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. [[Shostakovich]] had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in ''The Worker and the Theatre'', Shostakovich's ''The Tahitit Trot'' (from the ballet ''The Golden Age'') was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of "ideology harmful to the proletariat"". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, ''The First of May'' (1929) to express "the festive mood of peaceful construction".&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich and Stalin'' by Solomon Volkov (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Shostakovich Studies'' (1995) edited by David Fanning&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokofiev]] wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including ''Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution'' (1937). [[Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''Spartacus'' (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Music in Nazi Germany===
[[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] stated in 1930, "I don't believe anyone venerates [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] more than I";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Harvey|title=Music in fascist Italy|year=1988|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-02563-2|authorlink=Harvey Sachs}}&lt;/ref&gt; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, [[Carl Orff]]'s cantata ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford History of Western Music, vol 4'' (2005) by Richard Taruskin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of [[Goebbels]], who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of [[Gustav Mahler]], a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi|first=Erik|title=Music in the Third Reich|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-12948-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Die Schweigsame Frau]]'' (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, [[Stefan Zweig]], was a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The Twisted Muse |last= Kater |first= Michael |year= 1999 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-513242-4 |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">'''Natural heritage''' refers to the sum total of the elements of biodiversity, including flora and fauna ,
ecosystems and geological structures.

Heritage is that which is ''inherited'' from past generations, maintained in the present, and bestowed to future generations.&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; The term "natural heritage", derived from "natural inheritance", pre-dates the term "[[biodiversity]]." It is a less scientific term and more easily comprehended in some ways by the wider audience interested in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]]. 

The term was used in this context in the United States when [[Jimmy Carter]] set up the Georgia Heritage Trust &lt;ref&gt;http://maps.csc.noaa.gov/RoisDatabaseEntry/lawDetails.jsp?lawID=107{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The creation of the Heritage Trust Commission, Georgia Heritage Trust Act, Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A.)

 By James F. Cook, {{ISBN|0-86554-954-0}}, 2005 Mercer University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that Carter picked the term up from [[Lyndon Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-11-lady-bird-obit_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94 | first=Kathy | last=Kiely | date=2009-01-22 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; who used it in a 1966 Message to [[United States Congress|Congress]].  (He may have gotten the term from his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson]] who was personally interested in conservation.)  President Johnson signed the [[Wilderness Act|Wilderness Act of 1964]]. 

The term "Natural Heritage" was picked up by the Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC) when, under Robert E. Jenkins, Jr., it launched in 1974 what ultimately became the network of state natural heritage programs -- one in each state, all using the same [[methodology]] and all supported permanently by state governments because they scientifically document conservation priorities and facilitate science-based environmental reviews. When this network was extended outside the United States, the term "Conservation Data Center (or Centre)" was suggested by Guillermo Mann and came to be preferred for programs outside the US{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.  Despite the name difference, these programs, too, use the same core methodology as the 50 state natural heritage programs. In 1994 The network of natural heritage programs formed a membership association to work together on projects of common interest: the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). In 1999, Through an agreement with The Nature Conservancy, ABI expanded and assumed responsibility for the scientific databases, information, and tools developed by TNC in support of the network of natural heritage programs. In 2001, ABI changed its name to [[NatureServe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/about-us/our-history NatureServe History], The history of the Virginia-based conservation non-profit NatureServe.&lt;/ref&gt; NatureServe continues to serve as the hub of the NatureServe Network, a collaboration of 86 governmental and non-governmental programs including natural heritage programs and conservation data centers located in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureserve.org/natureserve-network About the NatureServe Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

An important site of natural heritage or [[cultural heritage]] can be listed as a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[World Heritage Committee]] of [[UNESCO]].  The UNESCO programme, catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity.  As of March 2012, there are 936 World Heritage Sites: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries.

The 1972 UNESCO World Heritage Convention established that biological resources, such as plants, were the [[common heritage of mankind]] or as was expressed in the preamble: "need to be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole.". These rules probably inspired the creation of great public banks of genetic resources, located outside the source-countries.

New global agreements (e.g., the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), now give sovereign national rights over biological resources (not property). The idea of static  conservation of biodiversity is disappearing and being replaced by the idea of dynamic conservation, through the notion of resource and  innovation.

The new agreements commit countries to conserve biodiversity, develop resources for sustainability and share the benefits resulting from their use. Under new rules, it is expected  that [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products has to be allowed by  the biodiversity-rich country, in exchange for a share of the  benefits.

In 2005, the [[World Heritage Marine Programme]] was established to protect marine areas with Outstanding Universal Values.

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNEP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans hold 97% of surface water, [[glacier]]s, and polar [[ice cap]]s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}". [http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spilhaus | first1 = Athelstan F | year = 1942 | title = Maps of the whole world ocean | url = | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 431–35 | doi=10.2307/210385| jstor = 210385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake

|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Definition|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lake|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

{{Main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species.

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] ''(Sizes to scale, distances and illumination not to scale)'']]
[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

'''Noise regulation''' includes [[statute]]s or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and [[municipal]] levels of government. After the watershed passage of the United States [[Noise Control Act|Noise Control Act of 1972]],&lt;ref name="92-574"&gt;U.S. Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, {{Usc|42|4901}} - {{Usc|42|4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; other local and state governments passed further regulations.

A noise regulation{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} restricts the amount of noise, the duration of noise and the source of noise. It usually places restrictions for certain times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kineticsnoise.com/industrial/noise_ordinance.html|title= Noise Ordinance
|publisher= Kinetics Noise Control, Inc|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] enacted national laws in 1960 and 1967 respectively, these laws were not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable as to address generally rising ambient noise, enforceable numerical source limits on aircraft and motor vehicles or comprehensive directives to local government.

==History==
[[File:NIOSH Occupational Noise Exposure Criteria Document.jpg|alt=NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|thumb|388x388px|NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Occupational Noise Exposure]]]

===United States initial legislation===
In the 1960s and earlier, few people recognized that citizens might be entitled to be protected from adverse sound level exposure.  Most concerted actions consisted of citizens groups organized to oppose a specific highway or airport, and occasionally a [[nuisance]] [[lawsuit]] would arise. Things in the United States changed rapidly with passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1969 and the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act, more commonly called the Noise Control Act (NCA), in 1972. Passage of the NCA was remarkable considering the lack of historic organized citizen concern. However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] that 30 million Americans are exposed to non-[[occupational]] noise high enough to cause [[hearing loss]] and 44 million Americans live in homes impacted by aircraft or highway noise.&lt;ref&gt;Noise Control Act, Public Law 92-574, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 94-301,1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public law 95-609, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 100-418, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

NEPA requires all federally funded major actions to be analyzed for all physical environmental impacts including [[noise pollution]], and the NCA directed the EPA to promulgate regulations for a host of noise emissions. Many city [[local ordinance|ordinances]] prohibit sound above a threshold intensity from trespassing over property line at night, typically between 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and during the day restricts it to a higher sound level; however, enforcement is uneven. Many municipalities do not follow up on complaints. Even where a municipality has an enforcement office, it may only be willing to issue warnings, since taking offenders to court is expensive. A notable exception to this rule is the City of [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland, Oregon]], which has instituted an aggressive protection for its citizens with fines reaching as high at $5000 per infraction, with the ability to cite a responsible noise violator multiple times in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;"City of Portland Code and Charter." Title 18, Chapter 18.18 [http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=28714#cid_18511 "Title 18 Noise Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. The same Act charges the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards. NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including OSHA) and to others in the occupational safety and health community through the publication and dissemination of Criteria Documents such as the Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/default.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow-up on initial U.S. laws===
Initially these laws had a significant effect on thoughtful study of transportation programs and also federally funded [[House|housing]] programs in the United States.  They also gave [[U.S. state|states]] and cities an impetus to consider environmental noise in their [[land use planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] decisions, and led to a host of statutes below the federal level.  Awareness of the need for noise control was rising. In fact, by 1973 a national poll of 60,000 U.S. residents found that sixty percent of people considered street noise to have a "disturbing, harmful or dangerous" impact.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development survey. As reported by Kenneth Eldred at the Fifth International Congress on Noise as an International Problem, Sweden, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend continued strongly throughout the 1970s in the U.S., with about half of the states and hundreds of cities passing substantive noise control laws. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-noise-and-noise-control-act|title=EPA History: Noise and the Noise Control Act|last=EPA|first=|date=1982|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulates [[aircraft noise]] by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|last=FAA|first=|date=Jan 9, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control [[Roadway noise|highway noise]] as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/|title=Highway Traffic Noise|last=FHWA|first=|date=June 5, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some states continued to act. California carried out an ambitious plan to require its cities to establish a "Noise Element of the General Plan," which provides guidance for land planning decisions to minimize noise impacts on the public.  Many cities throughout the U.S. also have noise ordinances, which specifies the allowable sound level that can cross property lines. These ordinances can be enforced with local [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s.&lt;ref name="Local ords"&gt;Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/cities.htm "Noise Regulations &amp; Ordinances of U.S. Cities, Counties and Towns."] Accessed 2010-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] actually passed the first national noise control act, but its scope was much more limited than the U.S. law, addressing mainly workplace and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Japan. Ministry of Environment. Law No. 98 of 1968. Latest amendment by Law No. 91 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and Asia===
Several European countries emulated the U.S. national noise control law: Netherlands (1979), France (1985), Spain (1993), and Denmark (1994). In some cases unlegislated innovations have led to quieter products exceeding legal mandates (for example, hybrid vehicles or best available technology in washing machines). [[Environmental noise]] is a special definition in the [[Directive (European Union)|European directive]] 2002/49/EC article 10.1.

==Local noise ordinances in U.S. and Europe==
[[Local ordinance]]s are principally aimed at construction noise, power equipment operated by individuals and unmuffled [[industrial noise]] penetrating residential areas. Thousands of U.S. cities have prepared noise ordinances that give [[noise control]] officers and police the power to investigate noise complaints and enforcement power to abate the offending noise source, through shutdowns and fines.&lt;ref name="Local ords" /&gt; In the 1970s and early 1980s there was even a professional association for noise enforcement officers called NANCO, "National Association of Noise Control Officials."

Today only a handful of properly trained Noise Control Officers remain in the United States. A typical noise ordinance sets forth clear definitions of acoustic nomenclature and defines categories of noise generation; then numerical standards are established, so that enforcement personnel can take the necessary steps of warnings, fines or other municipal police power to rectify unacceptable noise generation.  Ordinances have achieved certain successes but they can be thorny to implement. Many European cities are still treating noise as the U.S. did in the 1960s, as a nuisance and not as a numerical standard to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Effects of Noise on Health and Welfare
&lt;ref&gt;Kryter, K.D., "The Effects of Noise on Man”, Academic Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B, Lindvall, T, Schwela, D. "Guidelines for Community Noise", World Health Organization, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health and Welfare Criteria for Noise, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  EPA 550/9-73-002, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety, US Environmental Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

One obligation of a community is to protect its citizens from adverse environmental influences.  Noise is one of these factors, Noise has documented effects on people, they can be divided into three types.  The first type is a physical effect that directly and adversely effects a person's health. Hearing loss and vibration of bodily components are examples. The second type is a physiological effect that adversely effects a person's health; heightened blood pressure and general stress response are examples.  The third type is psychological that adversely effects a person's welfare; examples are distraction, annoyance, and complaint.
	The only feasible legal basis for a community’s right to control noise is based on these adverse health and welfare effects.  It is clearly easier to uphold the constitutionality of a noise ordinance in a court of law if it can be shown that it is based on health and welfare concerns.  The following is a short list of recognized effects of noise that can be addressed as a reason for a noise ordinance.
:Excess non-Occupational noise exposure, hearing loss on both public and private property, speech interference on both public and private property, audio interference on both public and private property, and sleep interference on mostly private property.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, M.H., Arand, D.L., Heart Rate Variability: Sleep Stage, Time of Night, and Arousal Influences" Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wright State University, and Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some legal considerations in the United States===
There are several fundamental issues that shape the legality, effectiveness and enforceability of any community noise regulation.

====Preemption====
The federal government has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs;&lt;ref&gt;Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 - Protection of Environment, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter G - Noise Abatement Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&amp;searchPath=Title+40%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+G&amp;granuleId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25-chapI-subchapG&amp;packageId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles.  They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices.  Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out.  They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential.  Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control.
States have police powers granted by the Constitution.  They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances.  California &lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code 46000-46080&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;NJAC 7:29&lt;/ref&gt; have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not.  One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigation&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Revised Statutes, Chapter 17-602&lt;/ref&gt; and right to farm laws that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Right to Farm Act Article, pp.823-14{{Clarify pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional vagueness====
In one case, the United States Supreme Court has said [[Void for vagueness]]
“It is a basic principle of due process (Amendment V) that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing ''fair warning''.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of ''arbitrary and discriminatory application''.  Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. (the chilling effect).  In one case,&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey vs. Clarksburg Inn, 375 N.J. Super. 624, 868 A.2s 112, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the court declared that numerical sound levels were constitutional as well as the term ''plainly audible'' provided it was associated with a reasonable distance. Two requirements for a noise ordinance provision is that:
#provide fair warning
#avoid the possibility of arbitrary enforcement

====Free Speech====
Examples are: slander, hate speech, and [[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|falsely calling "fire" in an assembly]]. Generally, the time, place, or manner of restrictions must:
#be content neutral
#be narrowly tailored
#serve a significant government interest
#leave open alternative channels of communication
One example&lt;ref&gt;Madsen vs. Women's Health Center&lt;/ref&gt; concerned protesters outside an abortion clinic.  The US Supreme Court stated that limitations placed on noise making were necessary to ensure the well-being of patients.

====Overbreadth====
The US Supreme Court has addressed the issue of too much regulation by defining overbreadth as: ''A clear, precise enactment may nevertheless be overbroad if, in its reach, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.'' One means to avoid being overbroad is by having provisions that are specific so that potential violators are given fair warning of what is prohibited. In one case &lt;ref&gt;Grayned vs. City of Rockford, 408 US 104 (19720&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the specificity of the city ordinance (Section 17-35) regulating school verbal protests was not ''constitutionally vague'', gave ''fair warning'', and was not an invitation to arbitrary enforcement and so was not overbroad, despite the implied limitation on free speech.

====Nuisance====
Nuisances are part of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether intentional or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private.  A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] defines a nuisance as''... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him.''  It defines a private nuisance as:..''anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.  As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public.'' The word ''nuisance'' is connected closely with the word ''disturbance'' which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to ''noise disturbance''.  Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact.

====Enforceability====
Care must be taken in writing a ''subjective'' noise provision so that it overcomes the objections listed above. Care must be taken when writing an ''objective'' noise provision to make sure that the sound levels are physically realizable.  For example, requiring the maximum sound level of an automobile to be 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or the maximum sound level in a residential zone to be 30&amp;nbsp;dB(A) opens the provision to an enforceability challenge

====Confiscation====
Confiscation is the taking of private property for public use without compensation. It may occur legally when the government seizes property used in illegal practices.    Confiscation may occur without an arrest of a person because it is seen as an arrest of property, rather than a person, and the necessity of finding a party guilty is not required in all cases. In many cases, the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant and the government need not prove anything ''beyond a reasonable doubt''. In order to seize property, there must be either a warrant or a showing of probable cause. The mere showing of probable cause to support the forfeiture of an individual’s property has been a controversial issue. Court opinion varies, but probable cause most often means that the government need only demonstrate reasonable grounds for the belief that the property is properly subject to forfeiture, which can be supported by something less than prima facie proof, but more than mere suspicion. The Peoria, Illinois noise ordinance (Sections 15-75 and 15-77) allows confiscation of vehicles that emit excessive sound caused by sound producing devices. Colorado Springs, Colorado (Section 9.8.102) permits confiscation of sound producing devices.

===Four Types of Noise Regulation===
&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fixed sound sources must be treated differently than moving sources.  In the former case, the listener is normally defined while for moving sources it is not.  Historically, regulations were enforced by the subjective judgment of an enforcing officer.  With the advent of sound measuring equipment, the judgment can be based on measured sound levels. Most comprehensive noise ordinances contain four types of provisions.

'''Subjective Emission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the output of a sound source is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' terms on public property as a criterion are examples.

'''Subjective Immission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the sound received by a listener is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard for the specific sound power generated by the source.. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' or ''noise disturbance'' terms on private property as a criterion are examples.

'''Objective Emission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the output of a sound source to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with specific maximum sound output levels for motor vehicles are examples.

'''Objective Immission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the sound received by a listener to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the specific sound power generated by the source.  Regulations with maximum allowable sound levels on property lines are examples

===Some Definitions used in the United States===
many communities have definitions that are local to them, such as those defining motor vehicles and sound levels and sound level  measurements.  Some that have been added to make noise enforcement more specific are listed here.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Engine Braking Device====
A compression braking device installed on large motor vehicles to assist in reduction, or control, of vehicle speed.  When activated, the engine converts from a power source to a power absorber by converting the engine into an air compressor.

====Muffler====
Any device for the abatement of sound emission while permitting the transfer of gas.  A muffler is considered to be in good working order if the sound reduction is equal to, or greater than, that of the original equipment.

====Noise Disturbance====
Any sound or vibration which:
# may disturb or annoy reasonable persons of normal sensitivities or;
# causes, or tends to cause, an adverse effect on the public health and welfare or;
# endangers or injures people or;
# endangers or injures personal or real property.
This can also be defined as ''noise nuisance''.

====Place of Public Entertainment====
Any location, exterior, or interior, to a building that regularly permits public entrance for entertainment purposes.  For this purpose, “public” means citizens of all types, including but not limited to, children, and private or public employees.

====Plainly Audible Sound====
Any sound for which the information content is unambiguously communicated to the listener, such as, but not limited to, understandable speech, comprehension of whether a voice is raised or normal, repetitive bass sounds, or comprehension of musical rhythms, without the aid of any listening device.

====Powered Model Vehicle====
Any self-propelled airborne, water-borne, or land-borne, plane, vessel, or vehicle, which is not designed to carry persons, including, but not limited to, any model airplane, boat, car, or rocket.

====Real Property Boundary====
An imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions.

====Sound Reproduction Device====
Any device, instrument, mechanism, equipment or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, stereo, tape player, musical instrument, television, loudspeaker or other sound-making or sound-producing device or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sound.

====Vibration Perception Threshold====
The minimum ground or structure borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a person of normal sensitivity to be aware of the motion through contact, hearing, or through visual observation of moving things.

===Ordinance Provisions for Stationary Sources in the United States===
there are three levels of regulation for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad ''subjective immission'' control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an ''objective immission'' control that uses specific levels of sound considered to be a noise disturbance.  Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation.  The concept that a potential violator should have ''fair warning'' that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.  The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Air Conditioning, Heating and Pool Equipment====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  An evaluation of the noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This provision is mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums.  Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact.

====Airport and Airport Operations====
Community control of airport created noise is limited to those sounds ''not'' related to flight operations.  The community is able to control the land use around the airport however.

====Animals====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  Most relate to barking dogs and put an upper time limit for continuous sound from them.  New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes.  They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption.

====Authorized Outdoor Discharge of Firearms and Shooting Ranges====
This provision contains only a curfew since most states protect shooting ranges from liability for noise disturbance.  It can include a curfew requirement and a requirement for a public hearing if expansion of the range is desired.  The provision may prohibit other weapons such as rocket propelled projectiles but may exempt unpowered weapons such as arrows. South Carolina (title 31 Chapter 18) requires that a sign stating '''SHOOTING RANGE-NOISE AREA''' be placed on all primary roads. Arizona (ARS 17-602) places a curfew from 10pm to 7 am.  It also allows a tradeoff between the number of events and the maximum permitted sound level. New York (Chapter 150) also trades off overall levels with the duration of the sounds. Colorado (Article 25-12-109) declared that noise restrictions on shooting ranges is a detriment to public health, welfare, and morale.

====Condominiums and Apartments====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It is designed to limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official.  One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of ''plainly audible'' but at the location of the listener instead of at a specific distance.  However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5&amp;nbsp;dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance.

====Construction====
This provision can be both a ''subjective immission'' control and an ''objective emission'' control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews.  The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community.  The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines.  There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926.  Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4)  permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays.  Albuquerque, New Mexico (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90&amp;nbsp;dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80&amp;nbsp;dB during the day for three days.

====Domestic and Commercial Power Tools====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is used in residential zones as well as in commercial areas abutting residential zones.  Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate ''outdoor'' and ''indoor'' use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools.  Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions.  Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II – 27.201) exempts snow removal tools.

====Explosives, Firearms, Impulsive Sources, and Similar Devices====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is for impulsive sound sources that are not associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for the character of the sound. Illinois () sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am.

====Fracking Operations====
Hydraulic Fracturing operations generate site sound as well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it.  Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery.  A ''subjective immission'' control or an ''objective immission'' control can be applied to surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels.  Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way.
The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations. Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA have announced a ban.  Colorado has numerous activities to stop fracking.

====Funerals====
This is a ''subjective emission'' control to reduce the excessive shouting and protests that can surround funeral proceedings.  It makes use of the ''plainly audible'' term and so adds a distance criterion.  There are certain groups, particularly those that object to involvement in foreign wars, who believe it is an obligation to disrupt and picket funerals, especially those of deceased military veterans.  This provision must not infringe on Constitutionally protected free speech. Illinois h(720 ILCS 5/26 6)has a comprehensive provision covering more aspects of this event than noise.  They failed to use “plainly audible” which is narrower than “audible”.  Utah(Section 76-9-108) restricts disruptive activity to beyond 200 feet.

====Loading and Unloading Operations====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am but only if the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am.

====Maximum Permissible Sound Pressure Levels====
This provision is an ''objective immission'' control.  It requires the measurement of sound levels at or beyond a property line and its vertical extension. There are several methods for implementing such a provision:
# It may not permit any exceedence or may permit exceedence only for a percentage of the measurement period. 
# It may require the measurement method to be instantaneous, such as dB(A) or time-averaged, such as Energy Equivalent Level (Leq).
# It may be a fixed level limit, such as 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A), or it may be a level relative to the ambient sound, such as 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) above the ambient.
# It may require measurement of the frequency spectrum, such as one octave bands, or A-weighting, such as dB(A).
# It may define different maximum levels based on zoning criteria, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
# It may define different maximum levels based on time-of-day or day-of-week, such as reduced maxima during night hours or on weekends.
# It may require reduction of maximum levels based on the character of the sound, such as intermittent or impulsive.
# It may exempt certain classes of sound sources, such as shooting ranges, farm equipment, emergency equipment, railroads, or licensed activities.
most noise ordinances set maximum levels for two time periods: Day (7am to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 7am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; San Diego (Article 9.25)sets three periods:  Day (7am to 7pm), Evening (7pm to 10pm), and Night (10pm to 7am) and exempts industrial zones from time based restrictions.  Seattle, WA (Chapter 25.08) sets two time periods but changes 7am to 9am on weekends and holidays.  Several states have maximum permissible land use sound levels in dB(A). Most have Day and Night periods and three use categories: residential, Commercial and Industrial. Washington{{vague|state? D.C.?|date=September 2015}} (Chapter 70.107) sets maximum levels in dB(A) but allows 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) more if the sound is only 15 minutes in an hour, or 10&amp;nbsp;dB(A) for 5 minutes in an hour.  Numerous cities have fixed levels, permitting excess levels for short times (e.g., Dallas, TX, Chapter 30) while others use Leq (Lincoln, NE, Chapter 8.24). Los Angeles, CA (Chapter XI) uses a relative level with a stated but ''presumed'' ambient.  New York City, NY (Chapter 19) requires Leq measurements to be made over one hour.  Atlanta, GA (){{vague|"()"|date=September 2015}} limits impulsive sound to 100&amp;nbsp;dB(C) at property lines, while most reduce the maximum level by 5&amp;nbsp;dB for pure tones and impulsive sounds.

====Motor Vehicle or Motorboat Repairs and Testing====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  If the activity is done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also is used for the testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways.  The first is application of the ''noise disturbance'' provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The second is being ''plainly audible'' at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5&amp;nbsp;dB.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a ''noise disturbance'' at any time.

====Noise Disturbance Prohibited====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. This provision is generic in that it covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement.  The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance and can be used as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give ''fair warning'', may lead to arbitrary enforcement on the part of the regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.

====Noise Sensitive Zones====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  It is used to reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations.  To provide ''fair warning'' visible signs must be posted.  It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt.

====Places of Public Entertainment====
This provision is an ''objective immision '' control.  It regulates the site of the sound source while the Sound Reproduction Devices section regulates the devices that create the sound.  It can regulate the sound levels received by ''involuntary'' listeners in the surrounding community as well as the sound levels received by ''voluntary'' listeners.  If the latter aspect is incorporated, limiting internal sound levels often resolves community noise impact. Los Angeles (Article 2, Section 112.06)requires warning signs and limits noise exposure to 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at any position normally occupied. Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is ''plainly audible'' within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided. Chicago, IL {Section 11-4-2805} limits received sound levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) inside a residential dwelling unit but if the ambient is greater, the limit is 65&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  If outdoors, the limit is ''conversational level'' at 100 feet from the property line.  If the building is set back 20 feet from the property line, the allowable level is 84&amp;nbsp;dB(A)!  Both of Chicago’s limits apply from 10 pm to 8 am.  Salt Lake health Department, UT {Section 4.5.11.(vii)} sets the limit at 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at a position that would normally be occupied by a patron and 100&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other positions. They also require a sign stating '''WARNING: SOUND LEVELS ON THIS PREMISE &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; MAY CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE. HEARING PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE'''.   Anchorage, AK (Section 15.70.060.B.12) sets maximum levels for any patron at 90&amp;nbsp;dB(A).

====Powered Unmanned Vehicles or Engines====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property.  It applies to airborne, water-borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles.  It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles.  it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields.  The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties.  Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the ''plainly audible'' criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source.

====Propane Cannons====
This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. A propane cannon is used to keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops.  In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon.  The provision may contain requirements that limit the number of cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon.  many states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation.  Florida() stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits.  They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise.  British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use.

====Public Address Systems====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It can contain a ''plainly audible'' term or a curfew.  It is applied to commercial facilities using a sound system to ''deliberately'' propagate mostly speech, but also music.  Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject.  Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used ''plainly audible'' as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am.  Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities.

====Sound Reproduction Devices====
This provision is ''subjective immission'' control. It may contain a numerical level or a ''plainly audible'' term and a curfew. it is applied to specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to ''amplified'' sound sources.  Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc.  Changing the title to the above  addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices.  Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use ''plainly audible'' as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4)

====Stadiums and Outdoor Music Festivals====
This provision can be either a ''subjective or objective immission'' control with a curfew.  The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community.  The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community.  Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101)  has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at residential locations.

====Stationary Emergency Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control with a list of devices that are exempt. It can have a term that limits the time periods in which emergency alarms may be tested. It can have a term that limits the activation time of burglar or fire alarms.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2815) limits the time for tests to 4 minutes between 9am and 5pm. Oregon (Chapter 467) prohibits sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary.

====Stationary non-Emergency non-Safety Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control that limits the activation period of alarms and restricts activation to a specific time-of-day or day-of-week. Los Angeles, CA () prohibits the sounding if the signal can be heard at 200 feet or more. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2820) considers the sound to be a noise disturbance in residential areas if the sound exceeds 5 minutes in any hour; steam whistles are exempt.  Albuquerque, NM (Section 9-9-12) restricts levels to 5&amp;nbsp;dB over the ambient at a property line and applies maximum permissible residential level as well as ''plainly audible'' restrictions at night.

====Street Sales====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches if there is a “disturbance of the peace”.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am.

====Tampering====
This provision prevents the modification of muffling devices that increase the emitted sound. It can also be used to prevent the commercial sale of such mufflers.  Most states and communities have prohibitions on tampering with noise reduction devices. whether stationary or moving.  Salt Lake County health Department (Section 4.5.10) prohibits modifications of mufflers that increase sound levels and prohibits tampering with noise rating labels.  See Section below on Adequate Mufflers.

====Vibration====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control.  Noise disturbance caused by vibration comes in three forms.  One is contact with vibrating surfaces, the second in auditory, and the third is the observation of surrounding objects movement.  Objectively regulating vibration is difficult so this provision makes use of the Vibration Perception Threshold.  Railroad caused vibration is preempted by federal law (CFR 201). Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2910) uses the perception threshold method.   Dallas, TX requires measurement of low frequency vibration.  Maryland uses the definition of ''noise'' to include sound and vibration at sub-audible frequencies.

====Wind Turbines====
The sound created by wind turbines is caused by the blade rotation similar to aircraft propellers.  Because the rotation rate is low, the frequency is also low, but the large size of many can result in disturbing sound levels, particularly in high wind areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A.L., Manwell, G.F., Wright, S. "Wind Turbine Acoustic Noise", University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Most local control is done by advantageous site planning.  New Hampshire (Title LXIV, Section 674:63) sets a sound level limit of 55&amp;nbsp;dB when measured at the site property line, allowing for exceptional events, such as storms. Studies have declared that wind noise can have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, "Public Health Effects of Wind Turbines", Minnesota Department of Health, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinance Provisions for Moving Vehicles in the United States===
Stationary sources have fixed positions, so it is possible to define the listeners and therefore ''immission'' controls are appropriate.  Motor vehicles are moving sources so it is not possible to define any specific listeners so ''emission'' controls are appropriate.  There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance.  These must be treated by specific provisions.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Adequate Mufflers or Sound Dissipation Devices====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control.  Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles.  It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound than the original equipment which has been measured.  It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the sound emission beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards.  Many states have requirements that a muffler ''shall be in good working order'' which is not specific enough.  California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product in violation of the muffler regulation  must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement.

====Airboats and Hovercraft====
This provision is both an "objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.  It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet). It can have a curfew.  It can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in the community.  It can also require the use of ear protectors on passengers. Unlike motorboats, the sound generators on these vehicles are airborne, resulting in more noise impact.  Florida (Section 327.65) requires a maximum level of 90 DB(A).  Maine (Title 12 Section 13068-A)has three levels: operating, operating test and stationary test

====Engine Braking Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control. It can restrict brake use for only safety purposes and by defining restricted areas.  It can require that mufflers be maintained to keep emitted sound to that of the original equipment.  Common terminology is '''Jake brakes''' after the Jacobs Company. Milwaukee, Wi (Section 80-69) prohibits use within city limits.  Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.B.3) prohibits use within 200 feet of a residence.  Albuquerque, NM posts signs requiring proper mufflers.

====Motorboats====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.
Because they are moving sources, ''objective'' controls are appropriate for measurements on open waterways.  Many motorboats operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas.  In this case, ''immission'' controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require ''immission'' measurements to be made at the shoreline. Many states require ''emission'' measurements to be made at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Horns or Signaling Devices====
This provision is both a prohibition and an ''emission'' control. it limits to use for safety warning only..  It limits the sound level to a specific level at a prescribed distance.  This provision is intended to limit horn use to safety and to limit the use of excessively loud air horns or ''Rumbler'' or ''Howler'' horns. California prohibits a person operating a motor vehicle to wear a headset or earplugs on both ears. . Oregon (Section 820.370) prohibits signaling sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary or returning from an emergency

====Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-Way====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles and for several vehicle speeds.  It is the backbone of vehicle sound emission regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet).  This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce.  It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way.  The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205).  Most states and many cities  have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt; The most common speed division is 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

====Motor Vehicle Racing Events====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It can define the method of vehicle operation that is used to define the maximum permitted sound level.  It can have a curfew.  Some states exempt motor vehicle racing events from noise disturbance litigation or prosecution.  Arizona (Section 28-955.03) exempts racing motorcycles from maximum sound levels and muffler requirements. Illinois {Section 35.903} had detailed regulations on racing vehicles It required a 14&amp;nbsp;dB reduction in sound output, limited sound output at half mater to 115&amp;nbsp;dB(A), and no more than 105&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Sound systems====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control, a ''subjective emission'' control, and a ''subjective immission'' for vehicles on a public right-of-way.  The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the ''plainly audible'' definition for limiting the sound output.  The third part uses the ''noise disturbance'' definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants.  There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle.  Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle.  Oregon prohibits sound systems being ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be ''heard'' at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level.  In Lakewood, CO it must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 25 feet.  In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet.  In Seattle, WA, it must not be ''plainly audible'' at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than ''clearly audible'' at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits.  Cincinnati, OH restricts ''plainly audible'' to 50 feet.  Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations.  Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet.  Hammond, IN restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am.  Florida states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems.  Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a closed vehicle or 100 feet otherwise.  Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is ''plainly audible'' on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Theft Alarms====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control with only an operational time limit. Los Angeles, CA () requires silencing in 5 minutes.  New York City, NY (Section 24.221(d)) requires automatic shut-off after 10 minutes and a prominent display of the local precinct number and telephone number.  Boston, MA (Section 16-26.2) considers it a violation if the alarm is plainly audible at 200 feet and is on more than 5 minutes.  Other states an communities have automatic shutoff times from 10 to 15 minutes.  Some communities have banned such alarms.

====Motor Vehicle Tire Squeal and Street Drag Racing====
This provision is  a ''subjective immission'' control. It is based on the ''noise disturbance'' from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way.  Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a ''noise disturbance''.

====Railroads====
Railroad activity is subject to federal regulations. Most communities do not attempt to regulate train sound.  The level of train horns permitted by the Federal Railroad Administration sufficiently high that community impact occurs. One method to alleviate this sound is to have a community establish a '''quiet zone''' where the rail crossings meet federal safety standards so that horn use is not needed.

====Recreational Off-road Vehicles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have ''emission'' controls measured at 50 feet;  the most common level is 82&amp;nbsp;dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way.  Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use.  Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am.  They prohibit any ''noise disturbance'' and require sound levels to the less than 96&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Recreational Snowmobiles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate.  Numerous states and communities have ''objective'' controls; the most common maximum level is 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A).	Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events.  Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also.

====Refuse Collection Vehicles====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective'' control. It can place a maximum sound level at a specific distance for the loudest operation.  It can set a curfew, or it can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 113.01) has a time limit that applies only within 200 feet of any residential building.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2900) considers any noise it a noise disturbance if the activity occurs between 8pm to 8am.  Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.6) considers it a noise disturbance if the activities occur between 10 pm to 7 am and closer than 800 feet from a dwelling.   Atlanta, GA (Section 74-137(a)(5)prohibits collection between 9pm and am on a weekend day or legal holiday, except by permit. In Maryland, refuse collection is exempt during daytime hours and must meet maximum land use levels [55&amp;nbsp;dB(A)] in residential zones at  night.

====Standing Motor Vehicles====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It sets a time limit on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a ''noise disturbance'' if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes.  Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone and there is a 10-minute maximum.  They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes.

==Building codes==
In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent [[building code]]s with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Noise Control Manual for Residential Buildings |last=Harris |first=David A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-026942-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.

The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[decibel|dB]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[insulated glazing|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners.  A special case of building skin design arises in the case of [[aircraft noise]], where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. First, airborne sound travels through walls or floor/ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are elevator systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  Since many of these sounds are inherently loud, the principle of regulation is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards (typically Sound Transmission Class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called [[Impact insulation class|Impact Insulation Class]] (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above.  This type of noise is somewhat more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel.  Commonly a performance standard of IIC equal to 50 is specified in building codes.  California has generally led the U.S. in widespread application of building code requirements for sound transmission; accordingly, the level of protection for building occupants has increased markedly in the last several decades.

==U.S. occupational safety regulations==
The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established maximum noise levels for occupational exposure, beyond which mitigation measures or [[personal protective equipment]] is required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Washington, D.C. [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 "Occupational noise exposure."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|29|1910|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Jacobs was born in Montreal on 3 December 1939. His parents were both natives of [[New York City]]: Jacob Joseph Jacobs graduated from New York University as a chemical engineer and Francis Alexander graduated from Barnard College in ancient languages. His interest in nature and the landscape was nurtured during summer family trips to the ocean and others in the northern boreal forest. His commitment to the urban landscape was derived from his experience of the cultural diversity and convivial social energy of Montreal. He is married to Ellen Vineberg Jacobs, distinguished professor emerita of Concordia University in Montreal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/la-recherche-a-ludem/la-vitrine-des-professeurs/informations/chercheur/495/pid/16/|title=Portail de la recherche: Informations|website=www.recherche.umontreal.ca|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs graduated from Antioch College with a bachelor's degree (1961) in engineering and fine arts. He continued his studies at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he obtained a Masters of Architecture degree (1964) followed by a Master of Landscape Architecture degree (1968).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He then pursued a program of special studies in human ecology at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his studies, Jacobs pursued both an academic and professional career. After first practicing architecture, he concentrated on landscape planning and urban design. In 1971 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1979 to full professor in the School of Landscape Architecture, Universite de Montreal. He was the school's first director (1978) and the first associate dean of research of the Faculte de l’Amenagement (1977–1984).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|last=Udem|first=Archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; He was named Emeritus professor in 2016.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Peter Jacobs is Fellow and past president of the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects]] (CSLA) (1978–1980), Fellow of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and served as the Canadian delegate to the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]] (IFLA) (1986–1995). In 2016, he was named Chair of the Montreal Heritage Council.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/article/2016/12/02/peter-jacobs-nomme-a-la-presidence-du-conseil-du-patrimoine-de-montreal/|title=Peter Jacobs nommé à la présidence du Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-04-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main achievements and contributions ==

=== Pedagogical development of a new field of studies ===
Jcobs' teaching is based on the structure and meaning of the urban and rural landscape as well as the use of criteria such as belonging, equity, and integrity in the design of landscape form. Due to his expertise, Peter Jacobs has been invited to evaluate numerous academic programs in Canada, Israel, Columbia, France, China and Spain. He has also given intensive courses and design studios in more than 50 universities around the world.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

His research and community activities have focused on the sustainable and equitable development and conservation of the landscape in association with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission as Chair of the Commission (KEQC) since 1979,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/evaluations/cqek.htm|title=Commission de la qualité de l'environnement Kativik (CQEK)|website=www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Chair of the Public Advisory Council for the Canadian State of the Environment Report (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Canada's Environment|last=|first=|publisher=Government of Canada, Canada Communication Group|year=1991|isbn=0-660-14237-6|location=the University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early stages of environmental evaluation ===
Jacobs was one of the early participants in a variety of environmental evaluation formats related to urban development and the North, both as a chair and a member of numerous public commissions. He chaired the public consultation process on the future of Lancaster Sound in the Canadian arctic (1980) and has Chaired the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission in [[Nunavik]] (since 1981).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; He also co-Chaired the public hearings related to the environmental impacts of the [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project|Great Whale Hydoelectric Project]] flowing into [[James Bay]], Quebec (1992–1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nunavik : un environnement en évolution|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Berrouard|first2=Daniel|last3=Paul|first3=Mireille|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Commission de la qualité de l’environnement Kativik|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the urban context, he has participated as a commissioner for the Bureau de consultation de Montreal and the Office de consultation Publique de Montreal on files related to the development of urban neighborhoods, urban infrastructure, and the planning and design of large metropolitan parks and nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocpm.qc.ca/commissaire/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs|date=2015-12-14|work=OCPM|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 1990, as a member of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council (CEARC), he co-edited and was one of the chief architects of a research report on ''Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Sadler|first2=Barry|publisher=Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hull, Quebec|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he has served as a consultant for programs sponsored by [[UNESCO]], MAB, UNU, and [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN]].

=== Relationship of landscape and culture ===
One of the principal research fields developed by Jacobs is linked to the impact of culture and cultural values to the perception and management of landscapes. Numerous international missions in Africa, Latin America, Australia, and Europe as well as the arctic landscapes of Northern Quebec have provided a rich array of conditions and experiences that contribute to a diversity of cultural perspectives as to how the landscape is perceived and managed.

His prolonged research visits to Dumbarton Oaks as chair of the Senior Fellows of the Landscape and Garden Studies program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/research/garden-landscape|title=Garden and Landscape Studies  — Dumbarton Oaks|last=admin|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently as Beatrix Farrand Distinguished Fellow provided further material with which to evaluate the diverse cultural visions of the landscape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/library-archives/dumbarton-oaks-archives/historical-records/oral-history-project/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs — Dumbarton Oaks|last=gabrielas|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community service ===
Jacobs' commitment to the community is marked by his desire to integrate professional practice with academic research in the service of community growth and development. As chair of the Environmental Planning Commission&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; from 1978–1990, he helped formulate nature conservation programs and action plans for numerous countries. His environmental activities have focused on nature conservancy, the preservation of urban open space, and the development of policy, programs, and plans in support of equitable and sustainable development.

He has served as vice-president of the Solomon Schecter Academy (1973–1976), advisor to the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, member of the intercultural advisory committee of the City of Montreal, and president of the Jewish Public Library of Montreal(1996–2000)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federationcja.org/media/singles/1191342115.pdf|title=Rapport Annuel|last=Federation CJA|first=|date=2006–2007|website=www.federationcja.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served as Chair of the community planning and allocations committee and as a Director of the Federation of Jewish Community Agencies, the United Israel Agencies of Canada and the Canadian Jewish National Fund.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7348">'''Placebo studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic discipline concerning the study of the [[placebo effect]]. The [[placebo effect]] is commonly characterized when patients are given a [[placebo]] or "fake" treatment and then exhibit  perceived improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JJ, Ritenbaugh C, Nichter M | title = Reconsidering the placebo response from a broad anthropological perspectives | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–52 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19107582 | pmc = 2730465 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-008-9122-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discipline was pioneered by [[Ted Kaptchuk]] and colleagues at the [[Program in Placebo Studies]] at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]]. It has been found through clinical [[placebo]] studies that the [[placebo]] effect in fact plays a significant role; one specific case being the clinical trials of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref name=brunoni&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunoni AR, Lopes M, Kaptchuk TJ, Fregni F | title = Placebo response of non-pharmacological and pharmacological trials in major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4824 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19293925 | pmc = 2653635 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside major depressive disorder, these placebo experiments have been noted in studies of migranes, irritable bowl syndrome, and even Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Luo|first=Yan|title=Mobile P 2P Databases|date=2017|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17885-1_795|work=Encyclopedia of GIS|pages=1267–1274|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319178844|access-date=2018-11-23|last2=Wolfson|first2=Ouri}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Until 1955, a [[placebo]] treatment was considered a fraudulent substance administered to appease difficult patients.&lt;ref name=kaptchuk&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ, Kelley JM, Deykin A, Wayne PM, Lasagna LC, Epstein IO, Kirsch I, Wechsler ME | title = Do "placebo responders" exist? | journal = Contemporary Clinical Trials | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–95 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18378192 | doi = 10.1016/j.cct.2008.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defintion for Placeo has changed its connotation over the years, idealy it has come to mean the false effects are belived to be true by one's expectations. Although, it is a false substance used to satisfy one's ilness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=47b60c2f-3a13-45e2-82eb-fb70092f29f2@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=89408012&amp;db=ers|title=Login - Sam Houston State University|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the rise of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), it became widely known throughout the academic community that [[placebo]] effects could in fact result in clinical changes and results.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; However, the ability to distinguish the efficacious ability of placebos over a period of time as well as those who are coined responders has proven difficult for scientists.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt;

== Double-blind ==
A [[Double-blind placebo-controlled trial|double-blind placebo]] is called so when neither the researcher nor the patients know who was given which form of treatment.  This is the most used form of the placebo methods. It differs from a single [[placebo]] in that the researchers actually know what patients are given which form of therapy.&lt;ref name="Moher-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Controlled studies ==
Although the double-blind placebo method is the most common, controlled [[placebo]] expierements require a different understanding. A placebo is given to one group of patients, while the treatment being tested is given to another group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm#hormone_therapy_facts|title=Hormone Therapy for Women: Side Effects, Cancer Risks|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the control is in the hands of people conducting the expierements. 

== Initial clinical experiments ==
In 1954, at [[Harvard Medical School]] a team led by [[Louis Lasagna]] lead the first known experiment to detect [[placebo]] responders.&lt;ref name=lasagna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasagna L, Mosteller F, Von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK | title = A study of the placebo response | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 770–9 | date = June 1954 | pmid = 13158365 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of [[placebo]] and morphine.&lt;ref name="lasagna"/&gt; Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between [[placebo]] respondents and non-placebo respondents.&lt;ref name="lasagna" /&gt; "Using Rorschach tests and qualitative interviews, respondents, compared to non-respondents, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were  regular church goers.".&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet undiscovered effects of the placebo within the placebo study.

In 1957, a team led by Wolf at [[Cornell University Medical School]] conducted an experiment to determine the reliability of the placebo response within the placebo study.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf S, Doering CR, Clark ML, Hagans JA | title = Chance distribution and placebo reactor | journal = The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–41 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13429202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on double blind [[placebo]] effects from omega 3 fatty acids and their persistant climb was done in 2006. This study concluded that although the results were "too premature to evaluate," they  showed there was a relationship between the efficacy of the antidepressant placebos and the intake of omega threes PUFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Pao-Yen|last2=Su|first2=Kuan-Pin|date=2007-07-15|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=07|pages=1056–1061|doi=10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even your daily diet can trigger aspired results.

[[File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] by [[Titian]] has a full provenance covering its passage through several owners and four countries since it was painted for [[Philip II of Spain]] in the 1550s.]]

'''Provenance''' (from the [[French language|French]] ''provenir'', 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'': "The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally mostly used in relation to [[works of art]] but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including [[archaeology]], [[paleontology]], [[archive]]s, [[manuscript]]s, printed books and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, [[chain of custody|custody]] and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping [[Authentication|authenticate]] objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of [[document]]ation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term ''[[chain of custody]]''.

In [[archaeology]] and [[paleontology]], the derived term '''provenience''' is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210004312/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/terms.htm Selected Archeological Terms, National Park Service (Internet archive)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance.

==Works of art and antiques==
The provenance of works of [[fine art]], antiques and [[antiquities]] is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/what-we-do/contributing-sector/spoliation/ National Museum Directors' Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, [[art theft|stolen]] or [[looted art]]. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in [[Arnolfini Portrait#Provenance|the Arnolfini portrait]].

The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long.

An expert [[certification]] can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. [[Jacques van Meegeren]] forged the work of his father [[Han van Meegeren]] (who in his turn had forged the work of [[Vermeer]]). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father.

[[John Drewe]] was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-security.org/myatt-drewe.htm A 20th Century Master Scam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkauctions.com/a-2-6-million-lesson-about-provenance/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Researching the provenance of paintings===
[[File:SirWilliamPetre.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[William Petre|Sir William Petre]], 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the [[Lumley inventories|collection]] of [[John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley|John, 1st Baron Lumley]], a fact indicated by the ''cartellino'' (a ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' representation of an inscribed label) added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]
The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a [[bibliography]] of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print.

Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting – style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Lisa, ''An Art Provenance Research Guide'' available at [http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 University of North Carolina Master's Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707092307/http://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/s_papers&amp;CISOPTR=1071&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=15 |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' the provenance of the painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]'' was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a ''cartellino'' (a representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/cartellino |title=Cartellino |publisher=The National Gallery |location=London |work=Glossary |accessdate=31 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over.

Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. 
*The [[Witt Library]] houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. 
*The Heinz Library at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. 
*The National Art Library at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a collection of UK sales catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/study-guide-art-auction-sales-sales-catalogues-price-guides/ V&amp;A Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660–1735.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artworld.york.ac.uk/news.jsp The Art World in Britain 1660-1735]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories.  
*The [[Getty Research Institute]] in Los Angeles has a ''Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance'' (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/provenance/charts.html Provenance Index Databases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Frick Art Reference Library]] in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frick.org/library/index.htm Frick Library]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.rkd.nl/Databases Netherlands Institute for Art History Databases]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a [[stately home]], it may be recorded in an inventory – for example, the [[Lumley inventories|Lumley inventory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dynasties'', a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a [[catalogue raisonné]] listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonnés is available at the [http://www.ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research]. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the [[Ozias Humphry|"Rice" portrait]] of [[Jane Austen]] concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorynews.com/ Bendor Grosvenor blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
[[File:BRA stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the [[British Records Association]], a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance]]
Provenance – also known as "custodial history" – is a core concept of [[archival science]] and [[archival processing]]. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent [[chain of custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kerstin |editor1-last=Abukhanfusa |editor2-first=Jan |editor2-last=Sydbeck |title=The Principle of Provenance: report from the First Stockholm Conference on Archival Theory and the Principle of Provenance, 2–3 September 1993 |location=Stockholm |publisher=Swedish National Archives |year=1994 |isbn=9789188366115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of provenance (sometimes also termed the principle of ''archival integrity'' or ''[[respect des fonds]]'') stipulates that records originating from a common source (or [[fonds]]) should be kept together – where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in [[finding aid]]s. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.

The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives'' by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the "[[Archival appraisal#History of appraisal theory|Dutch Manual]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Jennifer |year=2010 |chapter=Origins: evolving ideas about the principle of provenance |title=Currents of Archival Thinking |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=Eastwood |editor1-link=Terry Eastwood |editor2-first=Heather |editor2-last=MacNeil |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=9781591586562 |pages=23-43 (27-28) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Seamus |year=2012 |title=Digital Preservation, Archival Science and Methodological Foundations for Digital Libraries |journal=New Review of Information Networking |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=43-68 (esp. 50-53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Provenance'' is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/provenance/ |title=Provenance, Journal of the Society of Georgia Archivists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Pearson  | first = David  | title = Provenance Research in Book History: a Handbook  | publisher = British Library  | year = 1998 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-7123-4598-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearson, David |chapter=Provenance and Rare Book Cataloguing: Its Importance and Its Challenges | pages=1–9|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Books and Their Owners: Provenance Information and The European Cultural Heritage |publisher=[[Consortium of European Research Libraries]] | year=2005 |isbn=0-9541535-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her.

Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books.&lt;ref name="Curwen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Curwen, Tony  |author2=Jonsson, Gunilla  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Provenance and the Itinerary of the Book: Recording Provenance Data in On-line Catalogues | pages=31–47|editor=Shaw, David J. | title=Imprints and Owners: Recording the Cultural Geography of Europe |publisher=Consortium of European Research Libraries | year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9541535-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jackson  | first = H. J.  | title = Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books  | publisher = Yale University Press  | year = 2001 | page=2 | isbn=978-0-300-08816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, [[marginalia]], [[bookplate]]s, [[book rhyme]]s, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues.&lt;ref name="Pearson"/&gt;

==Wines==
In transactions of old wine with the potential of [[Storage of wine|improving with age]], the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of [[wine fraud]]. A documented history of [[wine cellar]] conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.&lt;ref name=OCW-ageing&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= ageing |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification.

==Science==

===Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology===
[[Archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] researchers use ''provenience'' to refer to the exact location or '''find spot''' of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site,&lt;ref name="nps" /&gt; whereas ''provenance'' covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term ''provenience'' appeared in the 1880s, about a century after ''provenance''. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a [[synonym]]ous variant spelling of ''provenance'', especially in [[American English]].

Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that "provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rosemary A. |last=Joyce |chapter=From Place to Place: Provenience, Provenance, and Archaeology |title=Provenance: An Alternate History of Art |editor1-first=Gail |editor1-last=Feigenbaum |editor2-first=Inge |editor2-last=Jackson Reist |date=2012 |page=48 |publisher=Getty Research Institute |series=Issues &amp; Debates |isbn=978-1606061220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's "birthplace", while provenance is its "[[résumé]]",&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thoughtco.com/provenience-vs-provenance-3971058 |first=K. Kris |last=Hirst |date=December 22, 2016 |title=Provenience, Provenance, Let's Call the Whole Thing Off: What is the difference in meaning between provenience and provenance? |work=ThoughtCo |publisher=Dotdash/IAC |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another).

Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus:&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt;
{{blockquote|1=Archaeologists ... don't care who owned an object—they are more interested in the context of an object within the community of its (mostly original) users. ... [W]e are interested in why a Roman coin turned up in a shipwreck 400 years after it was made; while art historians don't really care, since they can generally figure out what mint a coin came from by the information stamped on its surface. "It's a Roman coin, what else do we need to know?" says an art historian; "The shipping trade in the Mediterranean region during late Roman times" says an archaeologist. ... [P]rovenance for an art historian is important to establish ownership, but provenience is interesting to an archaeologist to establish meaning.}}

In this context, the ''provenance'' can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation,&lt;ref name="Hirst" /&gt; as in art history contexts – not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or [[cultural anthropology]] may have an early provenance – a known history that predates modern research – then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition.

Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered ''[[in situ]]'', archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic layers]] being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance.

In [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], it is recognized that [[fossil]]s can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently ''in-situ'', in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different [[outcrop]]s. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the ''provenience'' and ''provenance'' distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] treats the terms as synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://collections.paleo.amnh.org/24/glossary |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |work=PaleoPortal Collections Management |title=Glossary |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of ''provenience'' in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology.

While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance.

===Data provenance===

Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provence Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at "establishing inter-operability of systems" through information exchange agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau et al.

===Petrology===
{{See also|Provenance (geology)}}
[[Image:QFLtriangle.jpg|thumb|A [[QFL diagram]] (Quartz, Feldspar, Lithic fragments) used to determine [[tectonic]] provenance in sandstones]]
In the [[geologic]] use of the term, provenance instead refers to the origin or source area of particles within a rock, most commonly in [[sedimentary rocks]]. It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram).

===Seed provenance===
Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the [[adaptationist program]] – a view that populations are universally locally adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). "The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme". ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences'', 205: 581-598&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained that local seed is best [[Adaptation|adapted]] to local conditions, and that [[outbreeding depression]] will be avoided. [[Evolutionary biologists]] suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because:
# Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"&gt;Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
# Background population [[maladaptation]] can be driven by natural processes.&lt;ref name="Gould &amp; Lewontin 1979"/&gt;
# Human actions of [[habitat fragmentation]] drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Natural selection]] is changing rapidly due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669.&lt;/ref&gt; and habitat fragmentation
# Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (&lt;&amp;nbsp;500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal [[genetic variation]] among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for [[climate change adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M., Fady, B., Gömöry, D., A’Hara, S., Wolter, F., Ducci, F. Koskela, J., Bozzano, M., Maaten, T. and Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change|journal=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]] (EUFORGEN), Bioversity International, Rome, Italy|date=2015|page=xvi and 75 p|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers and law==
The term ''provenance'' is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. [[Chain of custody]] is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases.

Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its [[Software license|licensing terms]]. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood.

Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.&lt;ref name="Ma, et al." /&gt;
The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pasquier |first1=Thomas |last2=Singh |first2=Jatinder |last3=Powles |first3=Julia |last4=Eyers |first4=David |last5=Seltzer |first5=Margo |last6=Bacon |first6=Jean |title=Data provenance to audit compliance with privacy policy in the Internet of Things |journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing |date=1 April 2018 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=333–344 |doi=10.1007/s00779-017-1067-4 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3210921 |issn=1617-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.&lt;ref name="fast09"&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/hasan/hasan_html/index.html The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance], Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Chaining for securing data provenance in distributed information networks | author=Xinlei (Oscar) Wang, Kai Zeng, Kannan Govindan and Prasant Mohapatra. | booktitle=In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference for Military Communications. | year=2012 | conference=MILCOM '12 | DOI=10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as [[File system permissions#Permissions|read only]]. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally [[File deletion#Problem with accidental removal|deleting the file]].

Starting in the late 1990s, several books, convenings, and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design. Since then, public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cary|first=John|title=Dignifying Design|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dignifying-design.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 2012|author2=Courtney E. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Public interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American [[civil rights]] leader [[Whitney Young]] issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=Jacqueline|title=From the Studio to the Streets: Service Learning in Planning and Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Stylus Publishing|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=978-1563771002|pages=103|authorlink=Multiplying Knowledge: Service-Learning x Activism = Community Scholars|author2=Kara Hoffernan |editor=Mary C. Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

".  .  .  ''you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock.  You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designingactivism.com/2011/12/31/whitney-young-1968-speech-to-the-aia Whitney Young 1968 Speech to the AIA]&lt;/ref&gt;"

The response to Young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcoalition.org/aboutus/our%20roots.htm Design Coalition, "Our Roots"]&lt;/ref&gt;  CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities,&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Jason|title=University-Community Design Partnerships: Innovations in Practice|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-56898-379-4|pages=6–7|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/UnivCommDesign.pdf|editor=Mark Robbins|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods.

In architecture schools, “design/build programs” provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;  One of the earliest design/build programs was [[Yale University]]’s Vlock Building Project.  The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=David|title=The New Frontier in Education|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2012/03/The-New-Frontier-Education.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most publicized programs is the [[Auburn University]] [[Rural Studio]] design/build program, which was founded in 1993.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemence|first=Sara|title=Avant-Garde in Alabama|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304356604577342370002244732|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bostwick|first=William|title="Citizen Architect": The Humble Origins of Socially-Responsible Design|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1585096/citizen-architect-humble-origins-socially-responsible-design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rural Studio’s first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/samuel-mockbee.html|publisher=National Building Museum|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Interest Design from the 1990s – Present==
Interest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium.  Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers,&lt;ref name=Cary /&gt; which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

[[Non-profit]] organizations – including [[Architecture for Humanity]], BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, [[Public Architecture]], Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=C.J.|title=Does "Doing Good" Pay the Bills?|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/Community-Service/2012/03/perspective-practice/Humanitarian-Work.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allweil|first1=Yael|title=The House of Dance and Feathers Mardi Gras Indian Museum-New Orleans, LA by Project Locus: Patrick Rhodes, Executive Director [EDRA/Places Awards 2007--Design].|journal=Places|date=2007|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public interest design organizations also provide training and [[service-learning]] programs for architecture students and graduates.  In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/solutions-and-innovation/design-leadership/rose-architectural-fellowship/about-the-fellowship Enterprise Community website, "About the Fellowship"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University&lt;ref name=Cary&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=John|title=Chronology of the Public Interest Design Field|url=http://www.publicinterestdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Public-Interest-Design-Chronology-120601.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012|coauthors=PublicInterestDesign.org, University of Minnesota College of Design, Tandus Flooring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the [[University of Texas]]&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html Overview of Public Interest Design program, University of Texas School of Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416152806/http://www.soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html |date=2012-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218044206/http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the [[Harvard]] Graduate School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinterestdesign.com/harvard-school-of-design%20 Harvard School of Design course description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, a survey of [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Public Interest Design Takes Shape|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20120917/public-interest-design-takes-shape|publisher=Metropolismag.com|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Bryan|author2=Roberta Feldman |author3=Sergio Palleroni |author4=Davide Perkes |title=2011 Latrobe Prize Progress Report: Public Interest Practices in Architecture|date=31 December 2011|url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab094604.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications, Conferences, and Exhibits==
Several books have been published that showcase a variety of public interest design projects and practitioners:

The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world.  The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called “Design for the 98% Without Architects."&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder [[Samuel Mockbee]] challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: “I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Good Deeds, Good Design: Community Service Through Architecture|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1568983912|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;" 

In 2007, the [[Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum]] held an exhibition, titled “Design for the Other 90%,” curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the "Design Other 90" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled “Design for the Other 90%: CITIES”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities Design for the Other 90%: CITIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016121902/http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), held at the [[United Nations]] headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York curated an exhibit, called “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/smallscalebigchange/ MoMA Exhibition: "Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement"]&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

==Professional Networks==
One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization is the Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitydesign.org/about Association for Community Design website, "About" page]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}}

In 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by [[Architecture for Humanity]] in conjunction with co-founder [[Cameron Sinclair]]'s TED Wish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture.html Cameron Sinclair's TED Prize talk and wish for the Open Architecture Network]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}} Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the [[Creative Commons]] "some rights reserved" licensing system.

In 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched.

In 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.

In 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human-centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end-user of a product, place, or system — taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on "The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/ The Human-Centered Design Toolkit from IDEO]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=January 2018}} which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26974">'''Religion and environmentalism''' is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in the academic disciplines of [[religious studies]], [[religious ethics]], the [[sociology of religion]], and [[theology]] amongst others, with [[environmentalism]] and [[ecology|ecological]] principles as a primary focus.

==General overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Crisis of values===
This subfield is founded on the understanding that, in the words of Iranian-American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], "the environmental crisis is fundamentally a crisis of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]," and that [[religion]]s, being a primary source of values in any [[culture]], are thus implicated in the decisions humans make regarding the [[Natural environment|environment]].

===Burden of guilt===
[[History|Historian]] [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] first made the argument in a 1966 lecture before the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], subsequently published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', that [[Western Christianity]], having de-[[sacralized]] and instrumentalized [[nature]] to human ends, bears a substantial "burden of guilt" for the contemporary environmental crisis. White's essay stimulated a flurry of responses, ranging from defenses of [[Christianity]] to qualified admissions to complete agreement with his analysis.

===Eastern religions and indigenous peoples===
Some proposed that [[Eastern religions]], as well as those of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Neopaganism|neo-pagans]], and others, offered more [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] [[World view|worldviews]] than Christianity.  A third, more obscure camp, argued that while White's theory was  indeed correct, this was actually a benefit to society, and that thinning the populations of weaker plant and animal species via environmental destruction would lead to the [[evolution]] of stronger, more productive creatures.  See [[Kaitiaki]] in [[Māori religion]].

===Religion and ecology===
By the 1990s, many scholars of religion had entered the debate and begun to generate a substantial body of literature discussing and analyzing how nature is valued in the world's various religious systems. A landmark event was a series of ten conferences on Religion and Ecology organized by [[Yale University]] professors Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim and held at the [[Harvard University]] Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and Religion|last = Tucker|first = Mary Evelyn|publisher = Island Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59726-707-6|location = Washington|pages = 6|last2 = Grim|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/religions-of-the-world-and-ecology-archive-of-conference-materials/|title=Religions of the World and Ecology: Archive Of Conference Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 800 international scholars, religious leaders, and environmentalists participated in the conference series. The conferences concluded at the United Nations and at the American Museum of Natural History with more than 1,000 people in attendance. Papers from the conferences were published in a series of ten books (The Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series), one for each of the world's major religious traditions.

From these conferences, Tucker and Grim would form The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/|title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum has been instrumental in the creation of scholarship, in forming environmental policy, and in the greening of religion. In addition to their work with the Forum, Tucker and Grim's work continues in the ''Journey of the Universe'' film, book, and educational DVD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeyoftheuniverse.org/|title=Welcome - Journey Of The Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be the largest international multireligious project of its kind.

An active Religion and Ecology group has been in existence within the [[American Academy of Religion]] since 1991, and an increasing number of universities in [[North America]] and around the world are now offering courses on religion and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Religion and Ecology Group.” American Academy of Religion. https://papers.aarweb.org/content/religion-and-ecology-group Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship on the field of religion and ecology can be found in the peer-reviewed academic journal ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology'' and in reference works such as the encyclopedia ''The Spirit of Sustainability''.

===Religion and nature===
Other landmarks in the emerging field was the publication of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'' in 2005, which was edited by [[Bron Taylor]].  Taylor also led the effort to form the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, which was established in 2006, and began publishing the quarterly ''Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture'' in 2007.

==Religions and the environment==
===Buddhism===
The best asset religion offers is the moral framework by which practitioners must abide.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"&gt;Eco-Dharma Center. (N.d.) Buddhism and Ecology. Catalan Pyrenees: Nick Day. Retrieved February 18, 2010, from http://www.ecodharma.com/influences-articles/buddhism-ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many environmental problems have stemmed from human activity, it follows that religion might hold some solutions to mitigating destructive patterns. [[Buddhism]] idealizes and emphasizes interconnection,&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"&gt;Tucker, M.E. &amp; Williams, D.R. (Eds.). (1998). Buddhism and Ecology: The Interconnection of Dharma and Deeds. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating a mindset that creates a productive and cooperative relationship between humans and nature. That all actions are based on the premise of interconnection makes the Buddhist mindset effective in cultivating modesty, compassion, and balance among followers, which may ultimately mitigate the harm done to the environment.

One benefit of the Buddhist interconnected mindset is the inevitable humility that ensues. Because humans are entwined with natural systems, damage done upon the [[Earth]] is also harm done to humans.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"&gt;Badiner, A.H. (1990). Dharma Gaia. United States of America: Parallax Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is quite modifying to a human race that historically pillages the Earth for individual benefit. When rational humans minimize the split between humanity and nature and bridge the gaps,&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; only then will a mutual respect emerge in which all entities coexist rather than fight. Buddhism maintains that the reason for all suffering comes from attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Knierim, T. (Last modified 2009). Four Noble Truths. Big View. Retrieved February 24, 2010, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; When release from the tight grasp humanity has on individuality and separateness occurs, then oneness and interconnection is realized. So rather than emphasizing winners and losers, humanity will understand its existence within others; this results in a modesty that ends egoic mind.

Another benefit of Buddhist practice to the environment is the compassion that drives all thinking.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; When humans realize that they are all connected, harm done to another will never benefit the initiator.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Therefore, peaceful wishes for everyone and everything will ultimately benefit the initiator. Through accepting that the web of life is connected&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"/&gt;—if one entity benefits, all benefit&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt;—then the prevailing mindset encourages peaceful actions all the time. If everything depends on everything else, then only beneficial events will make life situations better. Acceptance of compassion takes training and practice, which is also encouraged by Buddhist moral conduct in the form of mediation. This habitual striving for harmony and friendship among all beings creates a more perfect relationship between humanity and nature.

Lastly, Buddhist mindset relies on taking the middle road or striving for balance. [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of Buddhism, spent his life searching for the outlet of human suffering, eventually concluding that a balance must be established between self-destruction and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (Producer) &amp; Bertolucci, B (Director). (1994). [[Little Buddha]]. United States of America: Buena Vista Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; While modern, industrial humans emphasize economic and social aspects of life and lastly environmental aspects, this view is lopsided.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When human preferences are leveled with environmental preferences—giving a voice to natural systems as well as human systems—then can balance and harmony be realized.

Therefore, using this idealized and disciplined framework that Buddhism has to offer can create lasting solutions to amending the broken relationship between humanity and nature. What ensues is an ethic, rather than a short-term policy or technological fix.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When never-ending consumption patterns cease for the betterment of the world as a whole, then all systems will harmoniously interact in a non-abusive way.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Without needing to adopt a new religion, just recognizing and accepting this mindset can help to heal the environmental injuries of the past.

Buddhists today are involved in spreading environmental awareness. In a meeting with the U.S Ambassador to the Republic of India [[Timothy J. Roemer]], the [[Dalai Lama]] urged the U.S to engage China on climate change in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian Newspaper from http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/220120&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama has also been part of a series on discussions organised by the [[Mind and Life Institute]]; a non profit organisation that specializes on the relationship between [[science]] and Buddhism. The talks were partly about ecology, ethics and interdependence and issues on global warming were brought up &lt;ref&gt;[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/on-climate-ethics-cow-burps-and-the-dalai-lama/ On Climate, Ethics, Cow Burps and the Dalai Lama] October 21, 2011 NYT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian views on environmentalism}}

[[Christianity]] has a historic concern for nature and the natural world. At the same time, ecological concerns operate in tension with [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] values, such as the [[Biblical]] notion of human dominion over the Earth. ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]] 1:28) A broad range of Christian institutions are engaged in the [[environmental movement]] and contemporary environmental concerns.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
[[Mormon]] environmentalists find theological reasons for stewardship and conservationism through biblical and additional scriptural references including a passages from the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 59:20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B. Smart {{ISBN|978-0-87905-843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[environmentally friendly]] policies, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a history of utilizing elements of conservationist policies for their [[Meeting house|meetinghouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ConservationPractices/|title=Timeline of Construction Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church first placed [[solar panels]] on a church meetinghouse in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027829/Mormon-Church-unveils-solar-powered-meetinghouse.html|title=Mormon Church unveils solar powered meetinghouse|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=28 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the church unveiled five [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified meetinghouse prototypes that are that will be used as future meetinghouse designs around the world, the first one having been completed in 2010 in [[Farmington, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104095531/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|archivedate=2012-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], practitioners and scholars find traditional approaches to the natural environment in such concepts as [[dharmic]] ethics or [[prakrti]] (material creation), the development of [[ayurveda]], and readings of [[vedas|vedic literature]]. Hindu [[environmental activism]] also may be inspired by [[Gandhian philosophy]] and practical struggles, such as the [[Bishnoi]] community in Rajasthan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jain, Pankaj|title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chipko]] resistance to [[forestry]] policies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Chappl and Tucker|title=Hinduism and Ecology: The intersection of earth, sky and water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahatma Gandhi played a major role in Indian environmentalism, and has been called the "father of Indian environmentalism".&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in similar fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally. Contemporary agrarian practices use the Bhagavad-Gita to establish practices that are deemed non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science}}
Through the tradition from the [[Quran]] and the prophets, the environment was made sacred. It is believed that God did not create the environment for a random reason, but rather a reflection of truth. One can gain profound knowledge from nature thus, human beings are to preserve it and look after it.  Many chapters in the  Quran, refer to the beauties of nature as well as the headings of many chapters indicating the importance of it, such as: "The Sun", "Dawn", and "Morning Hours". Thus man is God's representative on this planet, if he is not charged with sustaining it, then at least he must not destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Holy Quran and the Environment| year=2010| chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man| chapterurl=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129013542/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| archivedate=2010-11-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the concept of a [[Hima (environmental protection)|hima]] or "inviolate zone" refers to a piece of land that has been set aside to prevent cultivation or any use other than [[Spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}

In [[Judaism]], the natural world plays a central role in [[Jewish law]], literature, and liturgical and other practices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Within the diverse arena of Jewish thought, beliefs vary widely about the human relation to the environment, though the rabbinic tradition has put Judaism primarily on an [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] trajectory. However, a few contemporary Jewish thinkers and rabbis in the USA and [[Israel]] emphasized that a central belief in Judaism is that the Man (Ha Adam - האדם whose root comes from Haadama (earth) - האדמה, in [[Hebrew language]]), should keep the Earth in the same state as he received it from God, its eternal and actual "owner" (especially for the land of [[Israel]]), thus the people today should avoid polluting it and keep it clean for the future generations. According to this opinion, Judaism is clearly in line with the principles of environmental protection and [[sustainable development]].

In Jewish law (''halakhah''), ecological concerns are reflected in Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the [[Mishnah]] against harming the public domain, [[Talmud]]ic debate over noise and smoke [[Nezikin|damages]], and contemporary [[responsa]] on agricultural pollution. In [[Conservative Judaism]], there has been some attempt to adopt [[ecokashrut]] ideas{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} developed in the 1970s by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]]. In addition, Jewish activists have recruited principles of ''halakhah'' for environmental purposes, such as the injunction against unnecessary destruction, known as [[bal tashkhit]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In contemporary Jewish liturgy, ecological concerns have been promoted by adapting a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[ritual]] for the holiday of trees, [[Tu Bishvat]]. Biblical and rabbinic texts have been enlisted for prayers about the environment, especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Jewish Renewal]] movements.

In the U.S., a diverse coalition of Jewish environmentalists undertakes both educational and policy advocacy on such issues as [[biodiversity]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=About COEJL|publisher=Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, New York|url=http://www.coejl.org/~coejlor/about/|accessdate=2008-01-08}} and the [http://jewcology.org/map-of-initiatives/ Jewcology map of Jewish environmental initiatives].&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish environmentalists are drawn from all branches of religious life, ranging from Rabbi [[Arthur Waskow]] to the Orthodox group Canfei Nesharim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|title=Canfei Nesharim Named One of North America’s Most Innovative Jewish Nonprofits|publisher=Canfei Nesharim|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2008-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108231605/http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] have formed numerous governmental and [[non-governmental organizations]] to protect nature and reduce pollution. While many Israeli environmental organizations make limited use of Jewish religious teachings, a few do approach Israel's environmental problems from a Jewish standpoint, including [http://www.earthday.org/partner/heschel-center-environmental-learning-and-leadership the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership], named after [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] offers many ideas that are in line with environmentalism, such as [[wu wei]], [[moderation]], [[compassion]] and Taoist [[animism]]. Parallels were found between Taoism and [[deep ecology]]. Pioneer of environmentalism [[John Muir]] was called "the Taoist of the West". Rosenfeld wrote 'Taoism is environmentalism'.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more''].

Baird Earth's Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback Callicott&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the ancient and perhaps timeless philosophical concepts, like ''Parasparopagraho Jivanam'', were more recently compiled into a [http://www.jainology.org/publications/jain-delaration-on-nature Jain Declaration on Nature], which describes the religion's inherent [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] and deep ecology. ({{cite encyclopedia |title=Parasparopagraho Jivanam|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasparopagraho_Jivanam}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">[[Thomas P. Hughes]],&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, T. P. (1983). Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930. USA: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in his {{According to whom|seminal book,|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Kranzberg, "History &amp; Technology: Kranzberg's Laws" ''Society for the History of Technology'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930'', introduces the concept in the analysis of technological systems, whereby the reverse salient refers to a component of the system that, due to its insufficient development, prevents the technological system in its entirety achieving its targeted development.

==Technological systems and their evolution==
Technological systems may refer to a [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] nested structure of technological parts, whereby the [[system]] is seen as a composition of [[interdependence|interdependent]] sub-systems that are themselves systems comprising further sub-systems.&lt;ref name="tushman and murmann"&gt;[[Tushman, M.L.]] &amp; Murmann, J.P. 1998, "Dominant Designs, Technology Cycles, and Organizational Outcomes", Research in Organizational Behavior, vol. 20, pp. 231-266.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the holistic system as well as its properties is seen to be [[:wikt:synthesized|synthesized]] through the sub-systems that constitute it. Technological systems may also be seen as [[sociotechnical systems|socio-technical systems]] that contain, in addition to technical sub-systems, social sub-systems, such as the creators and users of [[technology]], as well as overseeing regulatory bodies. In both perspectives, technological systems are seen to be goal-seeking, therefore evolving towards objectives.&lt;ref name="sahal"&gt;Sahal, D. 1981, Patterns of Technological Evolution, Addison-Wesley, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; proposes that technological systems pass through certain phases during the system’s evolution. The first of these phases sees the invention and development of the system, owed greatly to the efforts of inventors and [[entrepreneur]]s, such as [[Thomas Edison]] in the development of the electric technological system. The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edison’s electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or [[Output (economics)|output]] efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components’ performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect [[Process (science)|processes]] amongst social and technical components, and may be described as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]], where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress. Subsequently, a sub-system which evolves at a sufficient pace contribute positively to the collective development, while a sub-system which does not develop sufficiently prevents the technology system achieving its targeted development. Hughes names these problematic sub-systems reverse salients.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2"&gt;Hughes, T.P. 1987, "The Evolution of Large Technological Systems" in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, eds. W.E. Bijker, T.P. Hughes &amp; T.P. Pinch, The MIT Press, USA, pp. 51-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse salients in technological system evolution==
A reverse salient is the inverse of a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] that depicts the forward protrusion along an object’s profile or a line of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes2" /&gt; Hence, reverse salients are the backward projections along similar, continuous lines. The reverse salient subsequently refers to the sub-system that has strayed behind the advancing performance frontier of the system due to its lack of sufficient performance. In turn, the reverse salient hampers the progress or prevents the fulfillment of potential development of the collective system. In line with the socio-technical standpoint, reverse salients can be technical elements such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[capacitor]]s of an electric system, or social elements such as organizations or productive units.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Because reverse salients limit system development, the further development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical [[innovation]]s. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, in the words of [[Nathan Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1969). The direction of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 18, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; for technological system [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]], which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through [[innovation|incremental innovations]]. Consequently, [[innovation|radical innovations]] may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the [[alternating current]] system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the [[direct current]] system could not.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Hence, the reverse salient is a useful concept for analyzing technological system evolution,&lt;ref name="dedehayir"&gt;Dedehayir, O. 2009, "[http://www.jiem.org/index.php/jiem/article/view/125 Bibliometric study of the reverse salient concept]", ''[[Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management]]'', Vol 2, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt; because often the analysis of technological systems centers on the factors that limit system development. More than technical components, these factors may also be social components. Subsequently, reverse salients may be more applicable in certain contexts to denote system performance hindrance than similar or overlapping concepts such as [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] and technological imbalance or disequilibrium.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1976). Perspectives on technology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse salient refers to an ''extremely complex situation in which individuals, groups, material forces, historical influences, and other factors have idiosyncratic, causal forces, and in which accidents as well as trends play a part. On the contrary, the disequilibrium concept suggests a relatively straightforward abstraction of physical science''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, while the reverse salient and bottleneck concepts share similarities and have been used interchangeably in particular contexts, the reverse salient often refers to the sub-system that not only curbs the performance or output of the collective system but also requires correction because of its limiting affect. This is not necessarily the case with bottlenecks, which are ''geometrically too symmetrical''&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; and therefore do not represent the complexity of system evolution. For instance, a particular system’s output performance may be compromised due to a bottleneck sub-system but the bottleneck will not require improvement if the system’s present output performance is satisfactory. If, on the other hand, a higher level of performance would be required of the same system, the bottleneck may emerge as a reverse salient that holds the system back from attaining that higher output performance.

==Reverse salient examples==
While numerous studies illustrate technological systems that have been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes,&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; who gives a historical account of the development of Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the [[Electrical generator|direct current generator]] were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.

Since Hughes' seminal work, other authors have also provided examples of reverse salients in different technological systems. In the [[ballistic missile]] technological development, where the systemic objective has been to increase missile accuracy, [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|MacKenzie]]&lt;ref name="mackenzie"&gt;MacKenzie, D. (1987). Missile accuracy: A case study in the social processes of technological change. In W. E. Bijker, T. P. Hughes &amp; T. J. Pinch (Eds.), The social construction of technological systems (pp. 195-222). USA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified the [[gyroscope]] sub-system as a technical reverse salient. Takeishi and Lee&lt;ref name="takeishi"&gt;Takeishi, A., &amp; Lee, K. (2005). Mobile music business in japan and korea: Copyright management institutions as a reverse salient. Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 14, 291-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that [[copyright|music copyright]] managing institutions have acted as a social reverse salient in the evolution of the [[mobile music]] technology system in Japan and Korea, where the objective was to proliferate mobile music throughout the end-user market. And further, Mulder and Knot,&lt;ref name="mulder"&gt;Mulder, K., &amp; Knot, M. (2001). PVC plastic: A history of systems development and entrenchment. Technology in Society, 23, 265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; see the development of the PVC ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) plastic technology system to have been sequentially hampered by several states of reverse salience, including: difficulty to process PVC material, quality of manufactured products, health concerns for individuals exposed to effluent from PVC manufacturing facilities, and finally the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of vinyl chloride.

==Analytical measure of reverse salience==
The magnitude of reverse salience emerges as an informative [[parameter]] in technological systems analysis as it signifies not only the technological disparity between sub-systems but also the entire system’s limited level of performance. Notwithstanding its importance, the literature studying technological system evolution has remained limited in terms of analytical tools that measure the state of reverse salience. Dedehayir and Mäkinen&lt;ref name="dedehayir makinen"&gt;[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 Dedehayir, O. &amp; Mäkinen, S.J. 2008, "Dynamics of Reverse Salience as Technological Performance Gap: An Empirical Study of the Personal Computer Technology System", Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 55-66.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citer"&gt;[http://tta.mediacabinet.fi/en/research/citer/?id=82 CITER]&lt;/ref&gt; have subsequently proposed an [[Absolute value|absolute]] ''[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 performance gap]'' measure of reverse salience magnitude. This measure evaluates the technological performance differential between the salient sub-system (i.e. the advanced sub-system) and the reverse salient sub-system at a particular point in time. In turn, by evaluating a series of performance differentials over time, the performance gap measure helps reflect the dynamics of change in the evolving technological system through changing reverse salience magnitude.

==Origin of term==
According to Thomas Hughes, the  name "reverse salient" was inspired by the Verdun [[Salient (military)|salient]] during the [[Battle of Verdun]], which he claimed his history professor in college referred to as a "reverse salient". He described it as a backward bulge in the advancing line of a [[military front]].&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/6/1985_6_65.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as a [[Salient (military)|salient]]; moreover, "reverse salient" is not a military term in general usage.

[[Image:IncunabulumDetail.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail from a rare [[Blackletter]] [[Bible]] (1497) printed and rubricated in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Johann Grüninger]].]]
'''Rubrication''' was one of several steps in the [[medieval]] process of [[manuscript]] making. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called ''rubricators'', were specialized [[scribe]]s who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red [[ink]] for emphasis. The term ''rubrication'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''rubrico'', "to color red".

== History ==
The practice usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term ''[[rubric]]'' was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as [[missal]]s, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated,{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 | pp = 24–25}} and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.

Rubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting [[grapheme |character]] of a [[canto]] or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than [[illumination (manuscript) |illumination]], in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of [[gold]] to give the appearance of [[light]] within the text.

Quite commonly the manuscript's initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of [[annotation]]s made in the [[Margin (typography) |margins]] of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to "rubricate here" or "add rubric". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the rubricator can be used along with [[codicology]] to establish a manuscript's history, or [[provenance]].

Later medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of [[movable type]] printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The "great majority of [[incunable]]s did not issue from the press in a finished state… hardly any incunable was considered 'finished' by its printer…", suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works.  This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink "was not merely decorative… red's original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way".{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}

==Uses==
The title "generally was written in one or more lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title", showing both the importance of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process.{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 |  pp = 24–25}}  As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the [[provenance]] of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.

==Ink==
The recipe for the red ink is given in [[Theophilus Presbyter |Theophilus]]' ''[[De diversis artibus]]'':
{{Quote |
To prepare white-flake, get some sheets of lead beaten out thin, place them dry in a hollow piece of wood and pour in some warm vinegar or urine to cover them. Then, after a month, take off the
cover and remove whatever white there is, and again replace it as at first.  When you have a sufficient amount and you wish to make
red lead from it, grind this flake-white on a stone without water, then put it in two or three new pots and place it over a burning fire.  You have a slender curved iron rod, fitted at one end in a wooden handle and broad at the top, and with this you can stir and mix this flake-white from time to time. You do this for a long time until the red lead becomes visible.{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}}}

The process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials.  The white material is [[White lead |lead carbonate]] and the red material is [[lead(II,IV) oxide]].

The '''Répertoire International des Sources Musicales''' ('''RISM''', [[English Language|English]] ''International Inventory of Musical Sources'', [[German language|German]] ''Internationales Quellenlexikon der Musik'') is an international non-profit organization, founded in [[Paris]] in 1952, with the aim of comprehensively documenting extant sources of music all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Benton, "Répertoire International des Sources Musicales," ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians,'' 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 21, p. 194. {{ISBN|1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest organization of its kind and the only entity operating globally to document written musical sources. Shortly after its founding, A.H. King called RISM, "one of the boldest pieces of long-term planning ever undertaken for the source material of any subject in the humanistic field."&lt;ref&gt;Alec Hyatt King, "The Music Librarian, his tasks, national and international," ''Fontes Artis Musicae'' 6 (1959): 54; quoted in Benton, 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical sources recorded are manuscripts or printed music, writings about music and libretti. They are stored in [[Library|libraries]], [[archive]]s, [[Monastery|monasteries]], [[school]]s, and [[Private library|private collections]]. RISM establishes ''what'' exists and ''where'' it is kept. RISM is recognized among experts as the key place for documenting music sources all over the world.

The work of RISM in compiling a comprehensive index fulfills a twofold purpose: for one, music documents are protected from loss, and for another, they are made available to scholars and performing musicians.

== Organization ==
[[Image:BWV1001.jpg|thumb|Example of a music manuscript: [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], ''Sonata for Violin Solo'', BWV 1001]]

One or several RISM working groups in more than 35 countries take part in the project. Around 100 individuals from those working groups [[Library catalog|catalogue]] the musical sources preserved in their countries. They pass their results on to the RISM Zentralredaktion (Central Editorial Office) in [[Frankfurt am Main]], where the entries are edited and published.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Music Libraries (IAML): [http://www.iaml.info/r-projects Joint projects and assisted publications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302170740/http://www.iaml.info/en/activities/joint_projects |date=2015-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RISM working groups are currently active in the following countries and cities:
* [[Austria]]: Bregenz, Innsbruck, Salzburg and Vienna
* [[Belarus]]: Minsk
* [[Belgium]]: Brussels and Louvain

The RISM Zentralredaktion and the working groups in Germany are projects funded by the [[Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur | Academy of Sciences and Literature]] in [[Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adwmainz.de/projekte/repertoire-international-des-sources-musicales-rism-zentralredaktion-frankfurt/informationen.html Academy of Sciences and Literature, Mainz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314183157/http://www.adwmainz.de/index.php?id=142&amp;no_cache=1&amp;sword_list=RISM |date=2012-03-14 }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The other working groups receive independent funding in their own countries.

== Publications ==
RISM publications are divided into the following series:&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed list of publications, see the [http://www.adwmainz.de/fileadmin/adwmainz/MuKo_Publikationen/PV-RISM.pdf RISM List of Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Series A: arranged by composer
* Series B: arranged by topic
* Series C: index of [[music library|music libraries]] 
In addition to these, working groups conduct projects to document libretti surviving in their respective countries.

== RISM Series A/I – Printed Music ==
RISM Series A/I ''Individual Prints before 1800'' documents [[History of music publishing|printed music]] of works by a single composer published between 1500 and 1800. Collected prints (anthologies of works by various composers) are published in RISM series B.

Each individual entry contains the following information:
* Name of [[composer]]
* An [[Opus number|opus]] or [[Opus number#Catalogues|catalogue number]] if there is one
* Title of the print
* [[Sheet music|Format]] – e.g. score, [[Part (music)|parts]] or [[piano reduction]]
* Place of publication
* Publisher
* Year of publication, if possible
* List of libraries where is the item preserved

Series A/I is available through the RISM online catalog, after having appeared in print and as a [[CD-ROM]].&lt;ref name=printed&gt;"Printed Music (A/I and B/I) now in RISM's Online Catalog," http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/browse/3/article/64/printed-music-ai-and-bi-now-in-risms-online-catalog.html&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the stated intention of opening the way to the primary source for [[Musicologist|researchers]] and [[Musician|performers]], this sort of catalogue provides attractive possibilities for other areas of [[Research|interest and inquiry]] as well. For example, one can gain insight into many different topics while researching the reception of a [[Musical composition|piece]]. One way could be to find out how the music of a [[composer]] was regarded after his death; to find this out, it would be important to know how many and which of his works were [[Reprint|reissued]].

Over 78,000 printed editions by 7,616 [[composers]] (arranged alphabetically) from 2,178 [[libraries]] were documented in the nine volumes of the series (published 1971–1981). Four supplementary volumes appeared between 1986 and 1999, and in 2003, an index volume followed listing [[Publishing|publishers]], printers, [[Music engraving|engravers]] and places of publication. All volumes of RISM series A/I were published by [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]]. The [[CD-ROM]] was published by Bärenreiter-Verlag at the end of 2012, and the CD-ROM data were incorporated into the online catalog in 2015.

== RISM Series A/II – Music Manuscripts ==
RISM series A/II ''Music Manuscripts after 1600'' lists only [[Music manuscript|handwritten]] music. They are described in detail according to a uniform scheme containing more than 100 fields. There are currently more than 917,000 entries on pieces by around 27,000 composers available (as of November 2015, and the number is constantly increasing). The total number of music manuscripts extant worldwide is many times that large.

The entries are currently from more than 900 [[Library|libraries]] in 37 countries: [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Uruguay]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Venezuela]]. This makes RISM’s [[database]] by far the most extensive accessible set of records in the field.

The RISM database has been available free of charge online since June 2010. Access to this online catalog is through the Internet via the RISM online catalog or the RISM website. The catalogue was made possible through cooperation between RISM, the [[Bavarian State Library]] (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek), and the [[Berlin State Library]] (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin). The CD-ROM version of the accumulated database produced and published by [[K. G. Saur Verlag|K. G. Saur]] in [[Munich]] was discontinued in 2008. The subscription database hosted by [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO]] (formerly by NISC) is still available.

The catalogue entries describe each piece in detail. Included are, among other things, information about the composer (including dates of birth and death), title, [[Instrumentation (music)|performing forces]], as well as references to musicological literature. The manuscripts themselves are described in detail with respect to [[copyist]], place and time of origin, librettist, previous owners, and dedicatees. In addition, many works can also be identified by means of a music [[incipit]], that is, the opening notes or measures from important movements or sections of a piece.

A variety of search boxes enables browsing and discovery through any of these fields. Specific questions can be answered by combining specific indexes. For example, it is possible to immediately access all the information stored by RISM about [[Mass (music)|masses]] by [[Joseph Haydn]]. 
A search by means of a musical incipit is a valuable research tool when trying to identify an anonymous piece or a fragment of a piece. To make use of this tool, the researcher keys in the first few notes of the work.

The database provides information not only about the dissemination of works by composers who are still well known today, but also a wealth of knowledge about those many creative musicians who were highly regarded in their day, but are currently either little known, or even forgotten. This makes the database invaluable for music historians, and also makes it possible for performing musicians to “excavate” and rediscover many things.

== RISM Series B ==
RISM series B comprises a systematic series which documents a self-contained group of [[Primary source|sources]]. The volumes in series B are published by [[G. Henle Verlag|G. Henle]] of [[Munich]]. In addition, the portion of B/I covering the years 1500-1550 is available in the online catalog.&lt;ref name=printed /&gt; Series B includes (an English translation of the title appears in parentheses where necessary):

== RISM Series C ==
Entitled ''Directory of Music Research Libraries'', RISM series C lists in five volumes all the [[Music library|music libraries]], [[archive]]s, and [[Private library|private collections]] which house historical musical materials. This index of music libraries is produced in cooperation with the Publication Committee of the [[IAML|International Association of Music Libraries]] (IAML). The special volume ''RISM-Bibliothekssigel. Gesamtverzeichnis'' (RISM Library Sigla: Complete Index), which appeared in 1999, has been available in a regularly updated version on the RISM website since 2006, and in a searchable online database since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;RISM Zentralredaktion, announcement [http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsarchive.html 29 November 2011] and Birgit Grün, trans. Keith Harris, ''Forum Musikbibliothek'' 27 (2006/4), p. 331ff. Background information about the sigla&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|List of RISM abbreviations}}
RISM uses a series of abbreviations to identify different libraries and conservatories where manuscripts are located. For example, "I-MOe" means "Italy-Biblioteca Estense Universitaria, [[Modena]]."

== People who use the RISM publications ==
* [[Musicologist]]s looking for sources connected with their field of research find a basis for exploring catalogues of works and modern editions;&lt;ref&gt;"The present writer is grateful to record again a debt to ''RISM'' for directing him to four early tablatures for guitar and cittern, lying unrecognized in a small Swiss library--a discovery that marks one of the most substantial additions to the 16th-century instrumental repertory in many years." Daniel Heartz, "The Répertoire International des Sources Musicales," ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' 14 (1961): 271.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Performers who discover a vast wealth of little-known pieces for concerts off the beaten musical path;
* [[Librarian]]s who can explore sources that complement the holdings of their own libraries;
* [[Students]] who need to consult primary sources for an assignment or term paper;
* Music antiquarians who can look up information about other copies of pieces they are offering.

It has had a significant impact on collective responses to [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] in Western academic [[science]].

Published in 2014 by a team of [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]], [[Kathryn B. H. Clancy]], Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and [[Katie Hinde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.

Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.

== Methods ==
The study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists.  The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.

The survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential [[self-selection bias]]. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:

:32. Have you ever personally experienced inappropriate or sexual remarks, comments about physical beauty, cognitive sex differences, or other jokes, at an anthropological field site?

:39. Have you ever experienced physical sexual harassment, unwanted sexual contact, or sexual contact in which you could not or did not give consent or felt it would be unsafe to fight back or not give your consent at an anthropological field site?

An affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.

== Findings ==
Almost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of "sexual harassment" and "sexual assault" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all "sexual remarks" as sexual harassment and all "unwanted sexual contact" as sexual assault.  

The majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.

The SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/567418|title=News Bureau {{!}} ILLINOIS|last=Yates|first=Diana|website=news.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAFE2 ==
In 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robin G.|last2=Rutherford|first2=Julienne N.|last3=Hinde|first3=Katie|last4=Clancy|first4=Kathryn B. H.|date=2017-12-01|title=Signaling Safety: Characterizing Fieldwork Experiences and Their Implications for Career Trajectories|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=119|issue=4|pages=710–722|doi=10.1111/aman.12929|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as "green" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.

The rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites "yellow" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. "Red" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. 

SAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic and public impact ==
Prior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a "chilly climate" in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/context-and-variation/safe13-field-site-chilly-climate-and-abuse/|title=I had no power to say that's not okay: Reports of harassment and abuse in the field|last=Clancy|first=Kate|date=|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/17/young-scientists-face-rampant-sexual-harassment-in-the-field/|title=Study: Young female scientists face sexual harassment, assault while in the field|last=Hogan|first=Caelainn|date=2014-07-17|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/survey-finds-sexual-harassment-anthropology|title=Survey Finds Sexual Harassment in Anthropology|date=2013-04-13|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmonds|first=Anna|title=Many women scientists sexually harassed during fieldwork|url=https://www.nature.com/news/many-women-scientists-sexually-harassed-during-fieldwork-1.15571|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/16/sexual-assault-harassment-science-fieldwork-studies-research-study/12735343/|title=Sex assaults, harassment reported in science fieldwork|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gewin|first=Virginia|date=2015-03-11|title=Social behaviour: Indecent advances|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7542-251a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=519|issue=7542|pages=251–253|doi=10.1038/nj7542-251a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201512/astronomy.cfm|title=Astronomy Allies Team Up to Confront Sexual Harassment|website=www.aps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-end-sexual-harassment-in-astronomy1/|title=How to End Sexual Harassment in Astronomy|last=Urry|first=Meg|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study has had a major impact on American [[astronomy]] and [[physics]] in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/30/us/astronomy-sexual-harassment/index.html|title=Sexual harassment in STEM: 'It's tragic'|last=CNN|first=Sara Ganim,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, USA Rep. [[Jackie Speier]] of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speier.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-jackie-speier-introduces-bill-stop-rampant-sexual-abuse|title=Congresswoman Jackie Speier Introduces Bill to Stop Rampant Sexual Abuse, Harassment in STEM Research|date=2016-09-21|work=Congresswoman Jackie Speier|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/jackie-speier-sexual-harassment-science/|title=Rep Jackie Speier on Why She's Taking on Sexual Harassment in Science|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the USA [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/issuances/in144.jsp|title=Important Notice No. 144: Harassment (in144) {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the [[United States Congress|USA Congress]] to counter sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|date=2018-02-08|title=US science agency will require universities to report sexual harassment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01744-5|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=554|issue=7692|pages=287–288|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-01744-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.

On 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kateclancy.com/transcript-of-my-oral-testimony-from-february-27th-congressional-hearing-on-sexual-misconduct-in-the-sciences/|title=Transcript of my oral testimony from February 27th Congressional hearing on sexual misconduct in the sciences {{!}} Context &amp; Variation|website=kateclancy.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/what-happens-now-studies-of-sexual-harassment-show-the-way/|title=What Happens Now?

Since 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://breakingbio.com/2014/10/07/breaking-bio-episode-68-safe13-with-drs-clancy-nelson-rutherford-hinde/|title="Breaking Bio Episode 68 – #SAFE13 with Drs.

A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215842/http://www.education.umd.edu/MathEd/Outreach/DDP_MCPSSTEM%20.html |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200320/http://mastersed.uc.edu/masters-degree-in-education-online-programs/stem-science-technology-engineering-mathematics-teacher-degree/stem-degree-that-inspires-innovation/ |archivedate=2014-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial gap in STEM fields====
In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Engineering Indicators 2014." S&amp;E Indicators 2014 - Figures - US National Science Foundation (NSF). N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black.&lt;ref&gt;Landivar, Liana C. Disparities in STEM Employment by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin . Rep. N.p.: n.p., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field.&lt;ref&gt;"FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces Over $240 Million in New STEM Commitments at the 2015 White House Science Fair." National Archives and Records Administration. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Heriot, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3112683 Want to Be a Doctor? A Scientist?  An Engineer?:  An Affirmative Action Leg Up May Hurt Your Chances], Engage (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

====Legislation====
The [[America COMPETES Act]] (P.L. 110-69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the [[National Science Foundation]], [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] laboratories, and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce.

====Jobs====
In November 2012 the [[White House]] announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57556074-38/obama-opposes-silicon-valley-firms-on-immigration-reform/ |title=Obama opposes Silicon Valley firms on immigration reform |date=November 28, 2012 |author=Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are "projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to [[Economy of the United States|the economy]] or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doleta.gov/Youth_services/pdf/STEM_Report_4%2007.pdf |title=The STEM Workforce Challenge: the Role of the Public Workforce System in a National Solution for a Competitive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce |date=April 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identified sectors were as follows: [[advanced manufacturing]], [[Automotive]], [[Construction industry|construction]], [[financial services]], [[geospatial technology]], [[homeland security]], [[information technology]], [[Transportation]], [[Aerospace]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Energy industry|energy]], [[Health care industry|healthcare]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], and [[Retail industry|retail]].

The [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future|title=STEM: Good Jobs Now and For the Future|work=doc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Qatar]], [[AL-Bairaq]] is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at [[Qatar University]]. Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|title=AlBairaq World - Welcome to Al-Bairaq World|date=19 April 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419220638/http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/index.php|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|title=Supreme Education Council|website=Sec.gov.qa|accessdate=2017-08-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630045928/http://www.sec.gov.qa/En/Media/News/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=3405|archivedate=2017-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students|title=The Peninsula Qatar - Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students|website=Thepeninsulaqatar.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has so far shown positive results for the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejes.eu/images/issue/vol.1/no.3/4.pdf|title=Al-Ghanim, K.A; Al-Maadeed, M.A and Al-Thani, N.J (Sept. 2014) : IMPACT OF INNOVATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BASED ON RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS RESEARCH AND THEIR SELF-EFFICACY, EJES, 1(3), 39-57|website=Ejes.eu|accessdate=2017-08-20}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations has STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a [http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&amp;mode=detail&amp;document_id=189610 Directive no. 16] stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Sexual stimulation''' is any [[stimulation|stimulus]] (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains [[sexual arousal]], and may lead to [[orgasm]]. Although sexual arousal may arise without [[physical stimulation]], achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation.

The term ''sexual stimulation'' often implies stimulation of the [[sex organ|genitals]], but may also include stimulation of other areas of the body, stimulation of the senses (such as sight or hearing) and mental stimulation (i.e. from reading or [[sexual fantasy|fantasizing]]). Sufficient stimulation of the [[human penis|penis]] in males and the [[clitoris]] in females usually results in an orgasm.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|first=Wayne |last=Weiten |first2=Dana S.|last2=Dunn |first3=Elizabeth Yost |display-authors=2 |last3=Hammer|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st century|page=386|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clitoris"&gt;{{cite web|title='I Want a Better Orgasm!'|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113132443/http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenneth Mah"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Kenneth | last = Mah | first2 = Yitzchak M | last2 = Binik | title = The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–856| date = January 7, 2001 | pmid = 11497209| doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735800000696 | quote=Women rated clitoral stimulation as at least somewhat more important than vaginal stimulation in achieving orgasm; only about 20% indicated that they did not require additional clitoral stimulation during intercourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kammerer-Doak"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dorothy | last = Kammerer-Doak | first2 = Rebecca G. | last2 = Rogers | title =  Female Sexual Function and Dysfunction | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–183 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18486835 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.03.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889854508000235 | quote=Most women report the inability to achieve orgasm with vaginal intercourse and require direct clitoral stimulation ...

Some people practice [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]], whereby a person or their sexual partner controls the level of sexual stimulation to delay orgasm, and to prolong the sexual experience leading up to orgasm.

==Physical sexual stimulation==
[[File:Primary and specific erogenous zones.svg|thumb|The erogenous zones of the male and female body.]]

===Genital===
Physical sexual stimulation usually consists of touching the genitals or other [[erogenous zone]]s. [[Masturbation]], [[erotic massage]], sexual intercourse, a [[handjob]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] are types of physical sexual stimulation involving the genitals. [[Sexual arousal]] is usually triggered through sensitive nerves in these body parts,&lt;ref&gt;Schober, Justine M., and Donald Pfaff. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justine_Schober/publication/5968480_The_neurophysiology_of_sexual_arousal/links/545cf0c90cf2c1a63bfa5af6.pdf The neurophysiology of sexual arousal.]" Best practice &amp; research Clinical endocrinology &amp; metabolism 21.3 (2007): 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt; which cause the release of pleasure-causing  chemicals ([[endorphins]]) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. A person may also become sexually aroused by touching another person's genitals or other body parts.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] is triggered by stimulation of the glans penis or clitoris.&lt;ref name=Wheeless&gt;http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/bulbocavernosus_reflex Bulbocavernosus Reflex&amp;nbsp;– Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[sex toy]]s is to provide pleasure and stimulation through an alternative route than just using people's bodies. They can be used by someone on their own, with partnered sex, or group sex. They can be exciting and provide new types of stimulation that the body cannot produce, such as vibrations.

Sex toys have been used as a source of sexual stimulation for thousands of years. There have been [[dildo]]s found from the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm|title=Ancient Phallus Unearthed in Cave.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[Siltstone]] and polished to a high gloss. Dildos were also made of camel dung and coated with resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|last=Christina, E.|first=|publisher=Tarcher Perigree|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFcWmcGLXJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are uncertain whether these have been used for [[religious ritual]]s or for personal pleasure. It is known that dildos were used for [[fertility ritual]]s,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/sex-toy|title=The long, strange history of sex toys.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created their dildos from a carved penis covered in leather or animal intestines to create a more natural feel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Romans created double-ended dildos for use with a partner. Ancient Chinese dildos were made of [[bronze]] or other metals and some were hollow allowing them to be filled with liquid to simulate an [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With the hand: a cultural history of masturbation|last=Driel, M.|first=|publisher=Reaktion Books.|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used because wealthy Chinese men would often have too many wives to please. In Persia, they thought that the blood of the [[hymen]] was unclean, and should be avoided by husbands. On the night before a lady's wedding, a local holy-man would come and break her hymen with a large stone dildo, a ritual also used to confirm the virginity of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage customs of the world: from henna to honeymoons|last=Monger, G.|first=|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2004|isbn=|location=California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-genital stimulation  ===
There are many areas through which a person can be sexually stimulated, other than the genitals. To name a few, the nipples, thighs, lips, and neck can all provide sexual stimulation when touched. 
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation small sharpened.png|thumb|Sexual stimulation of a nipple]]
[[Nipples]]: One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin, R. &amp;|first=Meston, C.|year=2006|title=Nipple/breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women.|url=http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31341-2/fulltext|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=3|pages=450–454|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; administered a questionnaire about sexual activity to 301 participants and found that 81.5% of women reported that stimulating their nipples caused or enhanced sexual arousal and that 59.1% of them asked to have their nipples stimulated during sex. Furthermore, 51.7% of men reported that nipple stimulation caused sexual arousal, and 39% said that it enhanced their existing arousal. Research  using &lt;ref name="Komisaruk"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Komisaruk |first1=B.

The research suggests the sensations are genital orgasms caused by [[nipple stimulation]], and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain".&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levi |first=R, J. |year=2006|title=The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality.|url=|journal=Sexual &amp; Relationship therapy|volume=21|pages=237–249|via=|doi=10.1080/14681990600674674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women, one study indicated that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;

[[Thigh]]s: In 2012 the California Institute of Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=V. |last1=Gazzola |first2=M.L. |last2=Spezio |first3=J.A. |last3=Etzel |first4=F. |last4=Castelli |first5=R. |last5=Adolphs |first6=C. |last6=Keysers|first=|year=2012|title=Primary somatosensory cortex discriminates affective significance in social touch.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|pages=1657–1666.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1113211109|pmc=3382530}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured brain responses in heterosexual males as they were having their inner thighs touched whilst being [[MRI Scanner|MRI scanned]]. They were either watching a video of a woman touching their thigh or a man touching their thigh. They reported more sexual pleasure when they thought it was the woman touching them than the man, and this was reflected in their MRI scans with greater arousal of their somatosensory cortex. It can be therefore concluded that the thighs are an area that can cause sexual stimulation when touched.

[[Lip]]s: Lips contain a huge number of [[nerve endings]] and are considered to be an erogenous zone. Men report experiencing more pleasure from the stimulation of their lips than women do (see below for sex differences in stimulation). In addition to stimulation of the lips by touching, men can be visually stimulated by looking at a woman's lips. It has also been&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality.|last=Symons, D.|first=|publisher=Oxford university press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that men prefer women with fuller lips because they are an indicator of youth.

=== Sex differences in erogenous zones ===
This table&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows the sex differences in erogenous zones and includes the top ten most arousing areas for both sexes. Each body part was rated out of ten for how arousing it is when touched. Apart from body parts exclusive to one gender such as the penis or clitoris, many of the erogenous zones are similar and contain lots of nerve endings. They suggested also that women experience more areas of greater arousal than men do.

=== Internal stimulation: excitation-transfer theory of sexual arousal ===
The [[excitation-transfer theory]] states that existing arousal in the body can be transformed into another type of arousal. For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cantor |first1=J. R. |last2=Bryant |first2=J. |last3=Zillmann |first3=D. |year=1975|title=Enhancement of experienced sexual arousal in response to erotic stimuli through misattribution of unrelated residual excitation.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanne_Cantor/publication/21948123_Enhancement_of_Experienced_Sexual_Arousal_in_Response_to_Erotic_Stimuli_Through_Misattribution_of_Unrelated_Residual_Excitation/links/5431cbe00cf277d58e982d6f.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|pages=69–75|via=|doi=10.1037/h0076784}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants performed some physical exercise and at different stages of recovery had to watch an erotic film and rate how aroused it made them feel. They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.

== Alternative routes ==
The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.

=== Visual ===
Perhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnow | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Desmond | first2 = J.

Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of '[[Paraphilia|sexual deviation]]', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is [[pornography]] is yet another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than women&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C. E., &amp; Sloan, S. (1948). [[Sexual behavior in the human male]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, arguably, can be seen depicted through the "male glaze"&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, L. (1989). [http://theslideprojector.com/pdffiles/art6/visualpleasureandnarrativecinema.pdf Visual pleasure and narrative cinema]. In ''Visual and other pleasures'' (pp. 14-26). Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt; that dominates the pornography industry. Nonetheless, both sexes can be sexually aroused through visual stimulation. In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes. Their physiological responses to the video also showed characteristics of sexual arousal, such as increased urinary excretions of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levi | first1 = L | year = 1969 | title = Sympatho-adrenomedullary activity, diuresis, and emotional reactions during visual sexual stimulation in human females and males | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.5354&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 251–268 | doi=10.1097/00006842-196905000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study investigating male arousal showed that men were able to achieve rigid [[erection]]s through visual stimulation of an erotic film alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = B. | last2 = Sikka | first2 = S.

Studies that use visual stimulation as a means for sexual stimulation find that sexual arousal is predominantly correlated with an activation in [[Limbic system|limbic]] and [[Paralimbic cortex|paralimbic]] cortex and in [[Cerebral cortex|subcortical]] structures, along with a deactivation in several parts of the [[Temporal cortex|temporal]] cortex. These same areas are activated during physical sexual stimulation highlighting how powerful visual stimulation can be as a means of [[sexual arousal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holstege | first1 = G. | last2 = Georgiadis | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Paans | first3 = A. M. | last4 = Meiners | first4 = L. C. | last5 = van der Graaf | first5 = F. H. | last6 = Reinders | first6 = A.

=== Olfactory and evolutionary ===
Olfactory information is critical to human sexual behavior. One study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found that men experience sexual arousal in response to a female perfume. Individuals rated odourant stimulation and perceived sexual arousal. They also had [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] scans taken during the experiment. The results showed that olfactory stimulation with women's perfume produces activation of specific brain areas associated with sexual arousal in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huh | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = K. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = I. S. | last4 = Jung | first4 = S. I. | last5 = Kim | first5 = H. J. | last6 = Chung | first6 = T. W. | last7 = Jeong | first7 = G. W. | year = 2008 | title = Brain activation areas of sexual arousal with olfactory stimulation in men: A preliminary study using functional MRI | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31972-X/fulltext | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 619–625 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00717.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary analysis of sex differences in reproductive strategies can help explain the importance of smell in sexual arousal due to its link to immunological profile and offspring viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rikowski | first1 = A. | last2 = Grammer | first2 = K. | year = 1999 | title = Human body odour, symmetry and attractiveness | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | volume = 266 | issue = | pages = 869–874 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0717| pmc = 1689917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because olfactory cues may be able to trigger an [[incest]] avoidance mechanism by reflecting parts of an individual's genetic equipment. In one study, males rated visual and olfactory information as being equally important for selecting a lover, while females considered olfactory information to be the single most important variable in [[mate choice]]. Additionally, when considering sexual activity, females singled out [[Body odor|body odour]] from all other sensory experiences as most able to negatively affect desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herz | first1 = R. S. | last2 = Cahill | first2 = E. D. | year = 1997 | title = Differential use of sensory information in sexual behavior as a function of gender | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachel_Herz/publication/225106584_Differential_use_of_sensory_information_in_sexual_behavior_as_a_function_of_sex/links/56e01e2608ae979addf0e501.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Nature | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 275–286 | doi=10.1007/bf02912495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory ===
Auditory stimulants may also serve to intensify sexual arousal and the experience of pleasure. Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to men and women, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = R. J. | year = 1992 | title = The mechanisms of human female sexual arousal | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sex Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–48 | doi=10.1080/10532528.1992.10559874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Female copulatory vocalizations|copulatory vocalisations]] are likely to serve mutual sexual stimulation for mating partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Arrowood | first2 = P. C. | year = 1978 | title = Copulatory vocalizations of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), gibbons (Hylobates hoolock), and humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = | pages = 1405–1409 | doi=10.1126/science.663622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when not coupled with "touching", sounds can be highly sexually arousing. Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to "low moans" for erotic effect. [[Vaudeville]] Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "Orgasm" or [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[You Sure Love to Ball]]" includes sounds of the female orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corbett | first1 = J. | last2 = Kapsalis | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title =  Aural Sex: The Female Orgasm in Popular Sound| url = | journal =  TDR (1988-)| volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 102–111 | doi=10.2307/1146553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood induction study, exposure to certain music resulted in significantly greater [[penile tumescence]] and subjective sexual arousal for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = W. B. | last2 = DiBartolo | first2 = P. M. | last3 = Brown | first3 = T. A. | last4 = Barlow | first4 = D. H. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of positive and negative mood on sexual arousal in sexually functional males | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 197–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did reported higher levels of sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laan | first1 = E. | last2 = Everaerd | first2 = W. | last3 = Van Berlo | first3 = R. | last4 = Rijs | first4 = L. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and sexual arousal in women | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 441–443 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(94)00059-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men implicating sounds a means for sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Julien | first1 = E. | last2 = Over | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Male sexual arousal across five modes of erotic stimulation | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 131–143 | doi=10.1007/bf01542663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental stimulation ==
Sexual arousal includes feelings, attractions and desires, as well as physiological changes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;LeVay, S., &amp; Valente, S. M. (2006). ''Human sexuality'' (2nd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; These can be elicited not only by physical but also mental stimulations, such as [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]], erotic literature, dreams, role-play, and imagination.
[[File:Rope bondage-020914-2905-31.jpg|thumb|Bondage can be a sexual fantasy and is often practiced by those participating in BDSM. 
]]

=== Fantasy  ===
[[Sexual fantasy]] is a form of mental sexual stimulation which many people engage in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they are awake. Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It's also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = H. | last2 = Henning | first2 = K. | year = 1995 | title = Sexual fantasy | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 469–496 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas women are more likely to imagine themselves as passive participants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelley | first1 = K | year = 1984 | title = Sexual fantasy and attitudes as functions of sex of subject and content of erotica | url = | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 339–347 | doi=10.2190/j66d-n10e-lth5-8aw5}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barclay | first1 = A. M. | year = 1973 | title = Sexual fantasies in men and women | url = | journal = Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 205–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = K. | last2 = Gold | first2 = S. | year = 1988 | title = Relationship of sex, sex guilt, and experience to written sexual fantasies | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/YQQJ-7A8U-23LE-59KJ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 155–163 | doi=10.2190/yqqj-7a8u-23le-59kj}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this difference comes from the [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]]. Women have a higher minimum parental investment than males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring's chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = B. | last2 = Symons | first2 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Sex Differences in Sexual Fantasy: An Evolutionary Psychological Approach | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 527–555 | doi=10.1080/00224499009551579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasies can have benefits, such as increasing arousal more than other forms of sexual stimuli (such as an [[Erotic literature|erotic story]]) and increasing [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldey | first1 = K. L. | last2 = van Anders | first2 = S. M. | year = 2012 | title = Sexual arousal and desire: Interrelations and responses to three modalities of sexual stimuli | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)34099-6/fulltext | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 2315–2329 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who disclose their sexual fantasies to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether people are willing to open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, M. (2012). ''[https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/9806/Anderson_ku_0099D_11825_DATA_1.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Sexual communication in romantic relationships: An investigation into the disclosure of sexual fantasies]'' (Order No. AAI3489846).&lt;/ref&gt; A more negative effect of sexual fantasy is that it has been linked with [[sexual crimes]], and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, such fantasies are also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howitt | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = What is the role of fantasy in sex offending? | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 182–188 | doi=10.1002/cbm.585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, fantasy alone cannot be used as a sign that someone will become an offender.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Dreams ===
Nocturnal orgasms, or "[[Nocturnal emission|wet dreams]]" are when men ejaculate during sleep. These occur during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM (rapid eye movement)]] phases of sleep,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is the main stage when humans dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = H. | last2 = Kuga | first2 = R. | last3 = Uchiyama | first3 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Relationship between dream experience and sleep state under ultra-short sleep-wake schedule | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjppp1983/20/1/20_19/_pdf | journal = Japanese Journal of Physiological Psychology and Psychophysiology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 19–28 | doi=10.5674/jjppp1983.20.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that [[Erotic Dream|erotic dreams]] alone are enough to stimulate men, however erections accompany all REM phases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to self-report data, as many as 22% of young women may also experience [[orgasm]] during sleep, with such dreams being more common in college students in higher school years than younger students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henton | first1 = C. L. | year = 1976 | title = Nocturnal orgasm in college woman: Its relation to dreams and anxiety associated with sexual factors | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 129 | issue = | page = 245 | doi=10.1080/00221325.1976.10534034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orgasms experienced were positively correlated with high emotionality, including [[Sexual arousal|sexual excitement]], but also [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sexual role-play ===
[[Sexual roleplay|Sexual role-play]] is when people act out characters or scenarios which may sexually stimulate each other. This can include [[Sexual fantasy|fantasies]] (discussed above) and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]], such as [[BDSM]] (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) or [[Ageplay|age-play]]. It has been described by some as an adult form of [[Live action role-playing game|L.A.R.P]] (live action role-play).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harviainen | first1 = J. T. | year = 2011 | title = Sadomasochist role-playing as live-action role-playing: a trait-descriptive analysis | url = http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue2/IJRPissue2-Article5.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Role-Playing | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 59–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Role-play can also be carried out online, by typing stories to each other or pretending to be a character, and is therefore a form of mental stimulation you can engage in with another person without them being physically present. Many adolescents find online role-play pleasurable and arousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = S. | last2 = Paasonen | first2 = S. | last3 = Spisak | first3 = S. | year = 2015 | title = 'Pervy role-play and such': Girls' experiences of sexual messaging online | url = | journal = Sex Education | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 472–485 | doi=10.1080/14681811.2015.1048852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role-play can also include sexual [[Fan fiction|fanfiction]], where characters from well-known stories, that were not sexually or romantically together in the original story, are written into sexual scenes. [[Slash fiction]] is a type of fan fiction where the characters of the same sex (originally male-male) engage in romantic or sexual activities. Slash fiction allows people the freedom to share stimulating things that can be counter-cultural. However, there may still be [[copyright]] or [[Obscenity|obscenity laws]] if posted onto a public forum or published.&lt;ref&gt;Kustritz, A. M. (2008).

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/rz/v34n136/v34n136a4.pdf El metabolismo social: una nueva teoría socioecológica.] Relaciones. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">The '''Tanabe Hisao Prize''' ({{lang-ja|田辺尚雄音楽賞 or 田辺尚雄賞}}) (often known more simply as the "Tanabe Prize") was created in 1983 by the Tōyō Ongaku Gakkai ({{lang-ja|東洋音楽学会}}, "Society for Research in Asiatic Music"), the oldest musicological society of [[Japan]] (headquartered in [[Tokyo]]).  The prize is named after the musicologist [[Tanabe Hisao]] ({{lang-ja|田辺尚雄}},1883–1984), one of the founding members of the society.  The prize is awarded annually to one or several individuals or groups who have published an outstanding work of Asian [[musicology]]  during the previous year, one that "promotes further research in Asian musicology and contributes to Japanese scholarship."  It is generally considered the most prestigious award in the field of Asian musicology awarded in Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Tonkunst''', literally "The Art of Tone", is an obsolete term in the German language applied for art music of the 19th century, and often used in music history and [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetic]] representations.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRQMMHIW6NkC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false The Musician As Entrepreneur, 1700-1914: Managers, Charlatans, and Idealists],'' p. 87, [[Indiana University Press]] (2004), {{ISBN|0253344565}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably originated from the need to give the music a place among the classical arts like [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[prose]] and [[poetry]], and also recognize the composer or musician as a creative individual. The term is found for example in the inscriptions of the [[Walhalla memorial]] built in 1842,&lt;ref&gt;Karnes, Kevin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dy1RLj-OjgC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false Music, Criticism, and the Challenge of History: Shaping Modern Musical Thought in Late Nineteenth-Century Vienna],'' p. 176, [[Oxford University Press]] (2008), {{ISBN|0195368665}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a good example is [[Joseph Haydn]], titled as "Doctor der Tonkunst" ("Doctor of Tone-Art"), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as "Tondichter" ("Tone-poet"). Today the term is rarely used, but lives on, for example, in the name of the [[Tonkünstler Orchestra]].

Initially serving imperial, private, civic, and religious patronage, Western painting later found audiences in the [[aristocracy]] and the middle class. From the [[Middle Ages]] through the [[Renaissance]] painters worked for the church and a wealthy aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rr17bb/patronage.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:52:16 Discussion of the role of patrons in the Renaissance], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Baroque]] era artists received private commissions from a more educated and prosperous middle class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/artistic-patronage History 1450–1789: Artistic Patronage], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of "[[art for art's sake]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake Britannica.com], retrieved 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; began to find expression in the work of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J.

Western painting reached its zenith in Europe during the Renaissance, in conjunction with the refinement of drawing, use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], ambitious architecture, [[tapestry]], [[stained glass]], sculpture, and the period before and after the advent of the [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B.

The [[history of painting]] reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an [[animism|animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]], or they may be the result of a basic need of [[Emotional expression|expression]] that is [[essence|innate]] to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s.  Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language—called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today.
Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to those of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style.
[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]

Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of [[ancient Greece]] is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on [[pottery of ancient Greece]] and [[ceramic]]s gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of [[black-figure vase painting]] and [[red-figure vase painting]] still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis]] and [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]]; however, with the single exception of the [[Pitsa panels]], no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[File:Giotto di Bondone - No. 18 Scenes from the Life of Christ - 2. Adoration of the Magi - WGA09195.jpg|thumb|[[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]]]

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as [[International Gothic]] style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by [[Renaissance humanism]] and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as [[International Gothic]], or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy).  This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the [[Early Renaissance]].  

In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose first use on [[panel painting]]s was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]] (who died in 1409), but [[Robert Campin]] (previously known as [[the Master of Flémalle]]) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; 
[[File:La Anunciación, de Fra Angelico.jpg|thumb|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425–1428]]

Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism).  Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].  Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the [[Northern Renaissance]].    

In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. [[Masaccio]] is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s.  Then, artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[Early Renaissance]] period lasting to about 1495, and then [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] during the [[High Renaissance]] from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.  

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern High Renaissance]] such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of [[genre painting]] as a subject for large works began with [[Peter Aertsen]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as [[Romanists]].
[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], 1520–1523]]

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]].  [[Printmaking]] became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]] after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and [[Paolo Veronese]], continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Le Nain]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Georges de la Tour|Tour]],  and [[Claude Lorraine]], who focused on landscape painting.  Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour.  Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin).  In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.  Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as [[Dutch Golden Age Painting]].

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]], whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].

By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Romantic painters turned [[landscape painting]] into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery, the work of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] evoke sophistication, [[decadent movement|decadence]], and the philosophy of "art for art's sake". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |title=Novack, Barbara '&amp;#39;American Sublime'&amp;#39; Artforum, 2002, retrieved 30 October 2008 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.
[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind - Overschie bij maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Johan Jongkind]], 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism]]
A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]], whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and [[licked finish]] of [[academic art]], but inspired many younger artists. The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-François Millet]] also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], who painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as did the paintings of [[Johan Jongkind]] and [[Eugène Boudin]] (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[plein air]] painting.

In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as [[Édouard Manet]], Claude Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). ''Impressionism''. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. {{ISBN|0-300-05035-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].

[[Post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and the slightly younger [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called [[Divisionism]], attracted many followers such as [[Paul Signac]], and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.

The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms.  The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustav Klimt]], and the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

Symbolist painters mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Delvaille|Delvaille, Bernard]], ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. [[Greenwood Press]], 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907),  Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own Cubist inventions. [[Cubism]] was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], whose ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'' (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]. [[Juan Gris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others soon joined.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent |title=Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fauvism]]. The group gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (Kandinsky and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] (Kandinsky and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]).  Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to [[advertising|advertising art]] and fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Fauvism]] was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers.  Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''[[Green Stripe|The Green Stripe]]'', caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]] said of Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Otto Mueller]]. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], [[Brücke-Museum (Berlin)|Brücke Museum]]. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'' (1909) is seen here, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. [[Marc Chagall]]'s painting ''[[I and the Village]]'' tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and some Americans abroad such as [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like Marsden Hartley, [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=New Yorker article, accessed online 11 November 2008 |publisher=Newyorker.com |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm Jasonkaufman.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=17 October 2008 }}, accessed online 28 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism.

====Pioneers of abstraction====

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] is generally considered one of the first important painters of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]],  he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''Large Glass'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.
[[File:Duchamp - Nude Descending a Staircase.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'', 1912, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was decisive in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'' is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=From the Tate Modern |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]].

During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990.

The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

''Guernica'' is an immense black-and-white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75 Art and War]''. I.B. Tauris. {{ISBN|0857732811}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s through the years of World War II, [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]]. [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]], the Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], artists of the Mexican [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Frida Kahlo]]. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.

Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. "Frida Kahlo". Oxford Art Online.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.
 [[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]
Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/156 Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("American-Type Painting"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, {{ISBN|978-0807066812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html|title=Post Painterly Abstraction|author=|date=|website=www.sharecom.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, [[Woman III]], and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 NGA.gov.au], [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'' (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color field painting.

During the 1950s ''Color Field painting'' initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]]  and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction.

During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], and [[Elaine de Kooning]].

In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Melissa (2009). "Chronology", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780876332139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rachel (2003). ''Abstract Expressionists''. Chicago: Heinemann Library. {{ISBN|9781588106445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X]]'', 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland (1996). ''Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict''. (Munich) Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1664-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt, Michael, ''Anatomy of an Enigma''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-3520-5}} (1996), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455 ''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery |title=NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; '&amp;#39;Milton Avery – Onrushing Waves'&amp;#39; |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilton Kramer |url=http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ |title=Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, '&amp;#39;Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'&amp;#39; |publisher=Observer.com |date=2002-05-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pop art====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. 

In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]]; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]], gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by the artists [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in works such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963; [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]]), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83.&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from [[popular culture]].

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by [[W. W. Norton and Company]], NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of English artist [[David Hockney]], such as ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'', and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.
In New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]], Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] {{en icon}} ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)'' (1963), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'' (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Christo]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Rauschenberg's "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Craft, ''An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism'', University of Chicago, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hapgood, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62'', Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], Colorfield painting, and [[Minimal Art]].  Two influential teachers, [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas.

[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.

[[File:Gardenofdelight.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1971, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]]]
Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web&lt;/ref&gt; Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat'' is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.
[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Barnett Newman, [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (1967), for example. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (1971) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''.

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight''—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], Ronnie Landfield, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007" /&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], Video, [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was [[Frank Stella]], whose early "stripe" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, "16 Americans", organized by Dorothy Miller at the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]]. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]].

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]] [http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman], who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.
This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/24/less-is-more-ad-reinhardts-twelve-rules-for-pure-art/ ''Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art''], The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], Joan Snyder, [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[Monochrome painting]] and [[Hard-edge painting]] inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as [[Al Held]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, [[Neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.

====Neo-expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' is an example of Guston's return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 80s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination.  All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]].

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with the slightly younger artists [[Damien Hirst]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], the Americans [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], the Italians [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"/&gt;

Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kiefer-anselm.htm The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and [[collective memory]], but also [[occult]] symbolism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anselm-kiefer-1406 Fiefer, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Rothhorse2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Susan Rothenberg]], 1979, [[Neo-expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Esmann, F. Scott Hess, ''21st Century Figurative Art: The Resurrection of Art'', BookBaby Print, Nov 5, 2016, {{ISBN|1483582590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Hyman, ''The World New Made: Figurative Painting in the Twentieth Century'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2016, {{ISBN|0500239452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Figure and abstraction in contemporary painting'', Rutgers University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
