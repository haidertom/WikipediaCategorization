The '''accelerating expansion of the universe''' is the observation that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion]] of the [[universe]] is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AM-20170818"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES-20180311"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weaver |first1=Donna |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=Measuring universe expansion reveals mystery – Is something unpredicted going on in the depths of space? |url=http://earthsky.org/space/measuring-universe-expansion-reveals-mystery |date=11 March 2018 |website=[[Earth &amp; Sky]] |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/616-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-intermediate|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accelerated expansion was discovered in 1998, by two independent projects, the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]], which both used distant [[type Ia supernovae]] to measure the acceleration.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating universe find |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/# |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peebles |first1=P.

The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological [[redshift]], which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Hubble law]], which established that the further an object is from us, the faster it is receding.&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded [[Nobel Prize]]s for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmology |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=9780198526827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory evidence has been found in [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], and in analyses of the clustering of galaxies.

The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its [[dark-energy-dominated era]] roughly 5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Frieman"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Frieman |first=Joshua A. |last2=Turner |first2=Michael S. |last3=Huterer |first3=Dragan |year=2008 |title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=385–432 |arxiv=0803.0982 |bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn |1=&lt;ref name="Frieman" /&gt; Frieman, Turner &amp; Huterer (2008) p. 6: "The Universe has gone through three distinct eras: radiation-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≳ 3000}}; matter-dominated, {{math|3000 ≳ ''z'' ≳ 0.5}}; and dark-energy-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≲ 0.5}}. The evolution of the scale factor is controlled by the dominant energy form: {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''w'')}} (for constant {{mvar|w}}). During the radiation-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; during the matter-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and for the dark energy-dominated era, assuming {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}, asymptotically {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ exp(''Ht'')}}."&lt;br /&gt;
p. 44: "Taken together, all the current data provide strong evidence for the existence of dark energy; they constrain the fraction of critical density contributed by dark energy, 0.76&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.02, and the equation-of-state parameter, {{mvar|w}}&amp;nbsp;≈ −1&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (stat) ±&amp;nbsp;0.1 (sys), assuming that {{mvar|w}} is constant.

These results are robust – data from any one method can be removed without compromising the constraints – and they are not substantially weakened by dropping the assumption of spatial flatness."|group="notes"}}
Within the framework of [[general relativity]], an accelerated expansion can be accounted for by a positive value of the [[cosmological constant]] {{mvar|Λ}}, equivalent to the presence of a positive [[vacuum energy]], dubbed "[[dark energy]]". While there are alternative possible explanations, the description assuming dark energy (positive {{mvar|Λ}}) is used in the current standard model of [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which also includes [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

==Background==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{further|Cosmological constant|Lambda-CDM model|Hubble's law|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann equations}}
In the decades since the detection of [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) in 1965,&lt;ref name="Penzias&amp;Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A. A. |last2=Wilson |first2=R. W. |date=1965 |title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080&amp;nbsp;Mc/s |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=419–421 |bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P |doi=10.1086/148307}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Big Bang]] model has become the most accepted model explaining the evolution of our universe. The [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] defines how the [[energy]] in the universe drives its expansion.

:&lt;math&gt; H^2={\left ( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right )}^2=\frac{8{\pi}G}{3}\rho-\frac{{\Kappa}c^2}{a^2} &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Κ}} represents the [[curvature of the universe]], {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], {{mvar|ρ}} is the total energy density of the universe, and {{mvar|H}} is the [[Hubble parameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nemiroff |first1=Robert J. |authorlink1=Robert J. Nemiroff |last2=Patla |first2=Bijunath |title=Adventures in Friedmann cosmology: A detailed expansion of the cosmological Friedmann equations |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1119/1.2830536 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703739 |bibcode=2008AmJPh..76..265N |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We define a [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]
:&lt;math&gt; \rho_c=\frac{3H^2}{8{\pi}G} &lt;/math&gt;
and the [[density parameter]]
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega=\frac{\rho}{\rho_c} &lt;/math&gt;

We can then rewrite the Hubble parameter as

:&lt;math&gt; H(a)=H_0 \sqrt{{\Omega_ka^{-2} + \Omega}_ma^{-3} + \Omega_ra^{-4} + \Omega_\mathrm{DE}a^{-3(1+w)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where the four currently hypothesized contributors to the energy density of the universe are [[Shape of the universe|curvature]], [[matter]], [[radiation]] and [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=Bassett&gt;{{cite book |last=Lapuente |first=P. |chapter=Baryon Acoustic Oscillations |title=Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |isbn=978-0521518888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the components decreases with the expansion of the universe (increasing scale factor), except perhaps the dark energy term. It is the values of these cosmological parameters which physicists use to determine the acceleration of the universe.

The [[Friedmann equations|acceleration equation]] describes the evolution of the scale factor with time

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4{\pi}G}{3}\left( \rho + \frac{3P}{c^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[pressure]] {{mvar|P}} is defined by the cosmological model chosen. (see [[Accelerating universe#Explanatory models|explanatory models]] below)

Physicists at one time were so assured of the deceleration of the universe's expansion that they introduced a so-called [[deceleration parameter]] {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Ryden&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Cosmology |last=Ryden |first=Barbara |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Addison Wesley |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=September 2016}} Current observations point towards this deceleration parameter being negative.

===Relation to inflation===
According to the theory of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the very early universe underwent a period of very rapid, quasi-exponential expansion. While the time-scale for this period of expansion was far shorter than that of the current expansion, this was a period of accelerated expansion with some similarities to the current epoch.

===Technical definition===
The definition of "accelerating expansion" is that the second time derivative of the cosmic scale factor, &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt;, is positive, which implies that the [[deceleration parameter]] is negative. However, note this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; imply that the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] is increasing with time. Since the Hubble parameter is defined as &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t) / a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the definitions that the derivative of the Hubble parameter is given by 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2(1 + q) &lt;/math&gt;

so the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;. Observations prefer &lt;math&gt; q \approx -0.55 &lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; is positive but &lt;math&gt; dH/dt &lt;/math&gt; is negative.  Essentially, this implies that the cosmic recession velocity of any one particular galaxy is increasing with time, but its velocity/distance ratio is still decreasing; thus different galaxies expanding across a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times.

It is seen from above that the case of "zero acceleration/deceleration" corresponds to &lt;math&gt; a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; q = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = const&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; H(t) = 1/t &lt;/math&gt;.

==Evidence for acceleration==
To learn about the rate of expansion of the universe we look at the [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]-redshift relationship of astronomical objects using [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candles]], or their distance-redshift relationship using [[standard ruler]]s. We can also look at the growth of [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]], and find that the observed values of the cosmological parameters are best described by models which include an accelerating expansion.

===Supernova observation===
[[File:Asymmetric Ashes (artist's impression).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Artist's impression of a Type Ia supernova, as revealed by spectro-polarimetry observations]]
The first evidence for acceleration came from the observation of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which are exploding [[white dwarf]]s that have exceeded their [[Chandrasekhar limit|stability limit]]. Because they all have similar masses, their intrinsic [[luminosity]] is standardizable. Repeated imaging of selected areas of the sky is used to discover the supernovae, then follow-up observations give their peak brightness, which is converted into a quantity known as luminosity distance (see [[distance measures in cosmology]] for details).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Albrecht|first1=Andreas |display-authors=etal |title=Report of the Dark Energy Task Force |date=2006 |eprint=astro-ph/0609591}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectral line]]s of their light can be used to determine their [[redshift]].

For supernovae at redshift less than around 0.1, or light travel time less than 10 percent of the age of the universe, this gives a nearly linear distance–redshift relation due to [[Hubble's law]]. At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The full calculation requires computer integration of the Friedmann equation, but a simple derivation can be given as follows: the redshift {{mvar|z}} directly gives the [[cosmic scale factor]] at the time the supernova exploded.

:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{1}{1+z} &lt;/math&gt;

So a supernova with a measured redshift {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0.5}} implies the universe was {{sfrac|1|1 + 0.5}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}} of its present size when the supernova exploded. In the standard accelerated expansion scenario the rate of expansion still decreases, but does so more slowly than the non-accelerated case. This means that in the accelerated case, the past rate of expansion is slower than it would be in the non-accelerated case.  Thus in a universe with accelerated expansion, it takes a longer time to expand from two thirds its present size, compared to a non-accelerating universe with the same present-day value of the Hubble constant. This results in a larger light-travel time, larger distance and fainter supernovae, which corresponds to the actual observations. [[Adam Riess]] ''et al.'' found that "the distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia were, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density {{math|''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.2}} universe without a cosmological constant".&lt;ref name=Riess&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riess |first1=Adam G. |display-authors=etal |title=Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=1009–1038 |year=1998 |doi=10.1086/300499 |bibcode=1998AJ....116.1009R |arxiv=astro-ph/9805201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the measured high-redshift distances were too large, compared to nearby ones, for a decelerating universe.&lt;ref name=Pain&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pain |first=Reynald |last2=Astier |first2=Pierre |title=Observational evidence of the accelerated expansion of the Universe |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=521–538 |arxiv=1204.5493 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.009 |date=2012 |bibcode=2012CRPhy..13..521A |citeseerx=10.1.1.747.3792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baryon acoustic oscillations===
{{main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
In the early universe before [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] took place, [[photon]]s and matter existed in a [[Structure formation#Primordial plasma|primordial plasma]]. Points of higher density in the photon-baryon plasma would contract, being compressed by gravity until the pressure became too large and they expanded again.&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}} This contraction and expansion created vibrations in the plasma analogous to [[sound waves]]. Since [[dark matter]] only interacts [[gravitationally]] it stayed at the centre of the sound wave, the origin of the original overdensity. When decoupling occurred, approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |year=2009 |title=Five-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Data Processing, Sky Maps, and Basic Results |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H }}&lt;/ref&gt; photons separated from matter and were able to [[free streaming|stream freely]] through the universe, creating the [[cosmic microwave background]] as we know it. This left shells of [[baryonic matter]] at a fixed radius from the overdensities of dark matter, a distance known as the sound horizon. As time passed and the universe expanded, it was at these anisotropies of matter density where galaxies started to form. So by looking at the distances at which galaxies at different redshifts tend to cluster, it is possible to determine a standard [[angular diameter distance]] and use that to compare to the distances predicted by different cosmological models.

Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at {{nowrap|100 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Parsec#Megaparsecs and Gigaparsecs|Mpc]]}},&lt;ref name=Bassett/&gt; indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Daniel J. |display-authors=etal |title=Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large‐Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=2005 |volume=633 |issue=2 |pages=560–574 |doi=10.1086/466512 |bibcode=2005ApJ...633..560E |arxiv=astro-ph/0501171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clusters of galaxies===
Measuring the mass functions of [[galaxy cluster]]s, which describe the [[number density]] of the clusters above a threshold mass, also provides evidence for dark energy {{explain|date=March 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dekel |first=Avishai |title=Formation of Structure in the Universe |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1999 |isbn=9780521586320}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing these mass functions at high and low redshifts to those predicted by different cosmological models, values for {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|Ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained which confirm a low matter density and a non zero amount of dark energy.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

===Age of the universe===
{{see also|Age of the universe}}
Given a cosmological model with certain values of the cosmological density parameters, it is possible to integrate the Friedmann equations and derive the age of the universe.

:&lt;math&gt; t_0=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{da}{\dot{a}} &lt;/math&gt;

By comparing this to actual measured values of the cosmological parameters, we can confirm the validity of a model which is accelerating now, and had a slower expansion in the past.&lt;ref name=Pain/&gt;

==Explanatory models==

===Dark energy===
{{main|Dark energy}}
The most important property of dark energy is that it has negative pressure (repulsive action) which is distributed relatively homogeneously in space.

:&lt;math&gt; P=wc^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of light and {{mvar|ρ}} is the energy density. Different theories of dark energy suggest different values of {{mvar|w}}, with {{math|''w'' &lt; −{{sfrac|1|3}}}} for cosmic acceleration (this leads to a positive value of {{mvar|ä}} in the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe#Background|acceleration equation]] above).

The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is a cosmological constant or [[vacuum energy]]; in this case {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}. This leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has generally been known as the Standard Model of Cosmology from 2003 through the present, since it is the simplest model in good agreement with a variety of recent observations. Riess ''et al.'' found that their results from supernovae observations favoured expanding models with positive cosmological constant ({{math|''Ω&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}) and a current accelerated expansion ({{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0}}).&lt;ref name=Riess/&gt;

===Phantom energy===
{{main|Phantom energy}}
Current observations allow the possibility of a cosmological model containing a dark energy component with equation of state {{math|''w'' &lt; −1}}. This phantom energy density would become infinite in finite time, causing such a huge gravitational repulsion that the universe would lose all structure and end in a [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=Robert |last2=Kamionkowski |first2=Marc |last3=Weinberg |first3=Nevin |title=Phantom Energy: Dark Energy with {{math |''w'' &lt; −1}} Causes a Cosmic Doomsday |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=91 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.071301 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..91g1301C |pmid=12935004 |date=August 2003 |pages=071301 |arxiv=astro-ph/0302506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for {{math|''w'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|3|2}}}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;=70&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the time remaining before the universe ends in this Big Rip is 22&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caldwell |first1=R.

===Alternative theories===
{{see also|Dark energy#Theories of dark energy}}
There are many alternative explanations for the accelerating universe. Some examples are [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. [[Dark fluid]] is an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anaelle |last1=Halle |first2=Hongsheng |last2=Zhao |first3=Baojiu |last3=Li |date=2008 |title=Perturbations in a non-uniform dark energy fluid: equations reveal effects of modified gravity and dark matter |arxiv=0711.0958 |doi=10.1086/587744 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=177 |issue=1 |pages=1 |bibcode=2008ApJS..177....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some authors have argued that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be due to a repulsive [[gravitational interaction of antimatter]]&lt;ref name="benoit-levy"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. |last1=Benoit-Lévy |first2=G. |last2=Chardin |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/01/aa16103-10/aa16103-10.html |title=Introducing the Dirac–Milne universe |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=537 |issue=78 |page=A78 |year=2012 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201016103 |arxiv=1110.3054 |bibcode=2012A&amp;A...537A..78B }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hajdukovic"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D.

Another type of model, the backreaction conjecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/16/164008 |volume=28 |issue=16 |title=Backreaction: directions of progress |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |pages=164008 |arxiv=1102.0408 |bibcode=2011CQGra..28p4008R |last1=Räsänen |first1=Syksy |last2=Ratra |first2=Bharat |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.012809.104435 |volume=62 |issue=1 |title=Backreaction in Late-Time Cosmology |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |pages=57–79 |arxiv=1112.5335 |bibcode=2012ARNPS..62...57B |last1=Buchert |first1=Thomas |last2=Räsänen |first2=Syksy |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by cosmologist Syksy Räsänen:&lt;ref name="NS2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11498-is-dark-energy-an-illusion/ |title=Is dark energy an illusion? |date=2007 |newspaper=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rate of expansion is not homogenous, but we are in a region where expansion is faster than the background. Inhomogeneities in the early universe cause the formation of walls and bubbles, where the inside of a bubble has less matter than on average. According to general relativity, space is less curved than on the walls, and thus appears to have more volume and a higher expansion rate. In the denser regions, the expansion is slowed by a higher gravitational attraction. Therefore, the inward collapse of the denser regions looks the same as an accelerating expansion of the bubbles, leading us to conclude that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/23025-doctor-who-tardis-regions-universe.html |title=A Cosmic 'Tardis': What the Universe Has In Common with 'Doctor Who' |website=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit is that it does not require any new physics such as dark energy. Räsänen does not consider the model likely, but without any falsification, it must remain a possibility. It would require rather large density fluctuations (20%) to work.&lt;ref name="NS2007" /&gt;

A final possibility is that dark energy is an illusion caused by some bias in measurements. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltshire |first=David L. |year=2007 |title=Exact Solution to the Averaging Problem in Cosmology |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=99 |issue=25 |page=251101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101 |pmid=18233512 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99y1101W |arxiv=0709.0732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ishak, Mustapha |author2=Richardson, James |author3=Garred, David |author4=Whittington, Delilah |author5=Nwankwo, Anthony |author6=Sussman, Roberto |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123531 |journal=Physical Review D |title=Dark Energy or Apparent Acceleration Due to a Relativistic Cosmological Model More Complex than FLRW? |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=123531 |year=2008 |arxiv=0708.2943 |bibcode=2008PhRvD..78l3531I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mattsson, Teppo |doi=10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=42 |title=Dark energy as a mirage |issue=3 |pages=567–599 |year=2010 |arxiv=0711.4264 |bibcode=2010GReGr..42..567M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clifton |first=Timothy |author2=Ferreira, Pedro |date=April 2009 |title=Does Dark Energy Really Exist? |journal=Scientific American |volume=300 |issue=4 |pages=48–55 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0409-48 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-dark-energy-exist |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |pmid=19363920 |bibcode=2009SciAm.300d..48C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach uses a cosmological extension of the [[equivalence principle]] to show how space might appear to be expanding more rapidly in the voids surrounding our local cluster.

==Theories for the consequences to the universe==
{{See also|Future of an expanding universe}}
As the universe expands, the density of radiation and ordinary [[dark matter]] declines more quickly than the density of [[dark energy]] (see [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]]) and, eventually, dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the scale of the universe doubles, the density of matter is reduced by a factor of 8, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant if the dark energy is a [[cosmological constant]]).&lt;ref name=Ryden/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

In models where dark energy is a cosmological constant, the universe will expand exponentially with time in the far future, coming closer and closer to a [[de Sitter space]]time. This will eventually lead to all evidence for the Big Bang disappearing, as the cosmic microwave background is redshifted to lower intensities and longer wavelengths. Eventually its frequency will be low enough that it will be absorbed by the [[interstellar medium]], and so be screened from any observer within the galaxy. This will occur when the universe is less than 50 times its current age, leading to the end of cosmology as we know it as the distant universe turns dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |last2=Scherrer |first2=Robert J. |title=The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |year=2007 |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1545–1550 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0472-9 |arxiv=0704.0221 |bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1545K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A constantly expanding universe with non-zero cosmological constant has mass density decreasing over time, to an undetermined point when zero matter density is reached. All matter (electrons, protons and neutrons) would ionize and disintegrate, with objects dissipating away.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Baez]], "The End of the Universe", 7 February 2016. http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] include the [[Big Rip]] mentioned above, a [[Big Bounce]], [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Crunch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7050">'''Aesthetics of nature''' is a sub-field of [[ethics|philosophical ethics]], and refers to the study of natural objects from their [[aesthetics|aesthetical]] perspective.

==History==
Aesthetics of nature developed as a sub-field of philosophical ethics. In the 18th and 19th century, the aesthetics of nature advanced the concepts of disinterestedness, the pictures, and the introduction of the idea of positive aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Carlson2012&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Carlson|first=Allen
  |chapter=Environmental Aesthetics
  |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
  |edition=Summer 2012

  |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/environmental-aesthetics/
  |accessdate=2 October 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first major developments of nature occurred in the 18th century. The concept of disinterestedness had been explained by many thinkers. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper]] introduced the concept as a way of characterizing the notion of the aesthetic, later magnified by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who expanded it to exclude personal and utilitarianism interests and associations of a more general nature from aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961&gt;
{{cite journal
  |last=Stolnitz|first=J.
  |year=1961
  |title=Of the Origins of ‘Aesthetic Disinterestedness’
  |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism
  |volume=20|pages=131–143
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept was further developed by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] who referred it to a particular state of mind.&lt;ref name=Stolnitz1961/&gt;

==Theories==
The theory of disinterestedness opened doors for a better understanding of the aesthetics dimensions of nature in terms of three conceptualizations: 
# The idea of beautiful: this applied to tamed and cultivated European gardens and landscapes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The idea of the sublime: this explained the threatening and terrifying side of nature such as mountains and wilderness; however, when it is viewed through the disinterestedness perspective, it can be aesthetically appreciated rather than feared or neglected&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;
# The notion of the picturesque: the term "picturesque" means "picture-like", where the natural world is experienced as if it is divided into art-like scenes&lt;ref name=Carlson2012/&gt;

Objects experienced as beautiful tend to be small, smooth, and fair in color.&lt;ref name=Conron2000&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Conron|first=J.
  |year=2000
  |title=American Picturesque
  |location=University Park, Pennsylvania
  |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}} In contrast, objects viewed as sublime tend to be powerful, intense and terrifying. Picturesque items are a mixture of both, which can be seen as varied and irregular, rich and forceful, and even vibrant.&lt;ref name=Conron2000/&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

==21st century developments==

Cognitive and non-cognitive approaches of nature have directed their focus from natural environments to the consideration of human and human influenced environments and developed aesthetic investigations of everyday life.(Carlson and Lintott, 2007; Parsons 2008a; Carlson 2010){{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Human Perspectives and Relationship with Nature==
People may be mistaken by the [[objet d'art|art object]] analogy. For instance, a [[sandhill crane]] is not an art object; an art object is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an art object should be called an ''artifact''.&lt;ref name=Rolston2002&gt;

  |isbn=9780754605430
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is wildlife on its own and is not an art object. This can be related to Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an art object has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may be in the forest and perceive it as beautiful because of the plethora of colors such as red, green, and yellow. This is a result of the chemicals interacting with chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Leopold&gt;
{{cite book
  |first=Aldo|last=Leopold
  |year=1968
  |title=A Sand County Almanac
  |location=New York
  |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]
  |pages=224–225
}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's aesthetic experience may increase; however, none of the things mentioned have anything to do with what is really going on in the forest. The chlorophyll is capturing solar energy and the residual chemicals protect the trees from insect grazing.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

Any color perceived by human visitors for a few hours is entirely different from what is really happening.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;  According to Leopold, the three features of [[ecosystem]]s that generate land ethic are integrity, stability and beauty.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt; None of the mentioned features are real in nature.  Ecosystems are not stable: they are dramatically changing and they have little integration; ergo, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name=Leopold/&gt;

==Objectives==
In a Post-Modern approach, when an individual engages in aesthetically appreciating a natural thing, we give meaning to the thing we appreciate and in that meaning, we express and develop our own attitudes, values and beliefs.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Parsons|first=G.
  |title=Aesthetics and Nature
  |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our interest in natural things are not only a passive reflection of our inclinations, as Croce describes as the appreciation of nature as looking in a mirror, or what we might call our inward life; but may instead be the things we come across in nature that engage and stimulate our imagination.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; As a result, we are challenged to think differently and apply thoughts and associations to in new situations and ways.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;
 
As a characterization of the appreciation of art, nature aestheticists argue that post modernism is a mistaken view because we do not have a case of anything goes.The aesthetics appreciation of art is governed by some normative standards.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt; In the world of art, criticism may take place when people come together and discuss books and films or critics write appraisals for publications. On the contrary, there are not obvious instances of debate and appraisals where different judgments about the aesthetics of character of nature are evaluated.&lt;ref name=Parsons2008/&gt;

The '''cosmic age problem''' is a historical problem in astronomy concerning the [[age of the universe]]. The problem was that at various times in the 20th century, some objects in the universe were estimated to be older than the time elapsed since the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=Evidence&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#oldstars Evidence for the Big Bang] by Björn Feuerbacher and Ryan Scranton. January 25, 2006. Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as estimated from measurements of the expansion rate of the universe known as the [[Hubble constant]], denoted H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (This is more correctly called the Hubble parameter, since it generally varies with time).
If so, this would represent a contradiction, since objects such as galaxies, stars and planets could not have existed in the extreme temperatures and densities shortly after the Big Bang.

Since around 1997–2003, the problem is believed to be solved by most cosmologists: modern cosmological measurements lead to a precise estimate of the [[age of the universe]] (i.e. time since the Big Bang) of 13.8 billion years, and recent age estimates for the oldest objects are either younger than this, or consistent allowing for measurement uncertainties.

== Early years ==

Following theoretical developments of the [[Friedmann equations]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1920s, and the discovery of the expanding universe by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, it was immediately clear that tracing this expansion backwards in time predicts that the universe had almost zero size at a finite time in the past. This concept, initially known as the "Primeval Atom" by Lemaitre, was later elaborated into the modern [[Big Bang]] theory. If the universe had expanded at a constant rate in the past, the age of the universe now (i.e. the time since the Big Bang) is simply the inverse of the Hubble constant, often known as the ''Hubble time''. For Big Bang models with zero [[cosmological constant]] and positive matter density, the actual age must be somewhat younger than this Hubble time; typically the age would be between 66% and 90% of the Hubble time, depending on the density of matter.

Hubble's early estimate of his constant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubble|first1=E.|title=A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 1929|volume=15|issue=3|pages=168–173|doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168|pmid=16577160|pmc=522427|bibcode = 1929PNAS...15..168H }}&lt;/ref&gt; was 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, and the inverse of that is 1.8 billion years. It was believed by many geologists such as [[Arthur Holmes]] in the 1920s that the Earth was probably over 2 billion years old, but with large uncertainty.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The possible discrepancy between the ages of the Earth and the universe was probably one motivation for the development of the [[Steady State theory]] in 1948 as an alternative to the Big Bang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kragh|first1=Helge|title=Cosmology and Controversy|date=1999|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the (now obsolete) steady state theory, the universe is infinitely old and on average unchanging with time. The steady state theory postulated spontaneous creation of matter to keep the average density constant as the universe expands, and therefore most galaxies still have an age less than 1/H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; had been 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, our Milky Way galaxy would be exceptionally large compared to most other galaxies, so it could well be much older than an average galaxy, therefore eliminating the age problem.

== 1950–1970 ==

In the 1950s, two substantial errors were discovered in Hubble's extragalactic distance scale: first in 1952, [[Walter Baade]] discovered there were two classes of [[Cepheid]] variable star. Hubble's sample comprised different classes nearby and in other galaxies, and correcting this error made all other galaxies twice as distant as Hubble's values, thus doubling the Hubble time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|title=The Period-Luminosity Relation of the Cepheids|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=February 1956|volume=68|issue=400|pages=5|doi=10.1086/126870|bibcode = 1956PASP...68....5B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second error was discovered by [[Allan Sandage]] and coworkers: for galaxies beyond the [[Local Group]], Cepheids were too faint to observe with Hubble's instruments, so Hubble used the brightest stars as distance indicators. Many of Hubble's "brightest stars" were actually HII regions or clusters containing many stars, which caused another underestimation of distances for these more distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Humason |first1=M. L. |last2=Mayall |first2=N. U. |last3=Sandage |first3=A. R. |title=Redshifts and magnitudes of extragalactic nebulae |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=April 1956 |volume=61 |page=97 |doi=10.1086/107297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1958 Sandage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandage|first=Allan|title=Current Problems in the Extragalactic Distance Scale|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1958|volume=127|page=513|doi=10.1086/146483|bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published the first reasonably accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, at 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, which is close to modern estimates of 68–74&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riess|first=A.|title=A 3% solution: determination of the Hubble constant with the Hubble Space Telescope|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=730|issue=119|pages=119|arxiv=1103.2976|last2=Macri|first2=Lucas|last3=Casertano|first3=Stefano|last4=Lampeitl|first4=Hubert|last5= Ferguson|first5=Henry C.|last6= Filippenko|first6=Alexei V.|last7= Jha|first7=Saurabh W.|last8=Li|first8=Weidong|last9=Chornock|first9=Ryan|year=2011|bibcode = 2011ApJ...730..119R |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the Earth (actually the Solar System) was first accurately measured around 1955 by [[Clair Patterson]] at 4.55 billion years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=C.|last2=Tilton|first2=G.|last3=Inghram|first3=M.|title=Age of the Earth|journal=Science|date=21 January 1955|volume=121|issue=3134|pages=69–75|doi=10.1126/science.121.3134.69|pmid=17782556|bibcode = 1955Sci...121...69P }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially identical to the modern value. For H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, the inverse of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 13.0 billion years; so after 1958 the Big Bang model age was comfortably older than the Earth.

However, in the 1960s and onwards, new developments in the theory of stellar evolution enabled age estimates for large star clusters called [[globular clusters]]: these generally gave age estimates of around 15 billion years, with substantial scatter.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Further revisions of the Hubble constant by Sandage and [[Gustav Tammann]] in the 1970s gave values around 50–60&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandage|first1=A.|last2=Tammann|first2=G. A.|title=Steps toward the Hubble constant. VII - Distances to NGC 2403, M101, and the Virgo cluster using 21 centimeter line widths compared with optical methods: The global value of H sub 0|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=210|pages=7|doi=10.1086/154798|bibcode=1976ApJ...210....7S|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an inverse of 16-20 billion years, consistent with globular cluster ages.

== 1975–1990 ==

However, in the late 1970s to early 1990s, the age problem re-appeared: new estimates of the Hubble constant gave higher values, with [[Gerard de Vaucouleurs]] estimating values 90–100&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vaucouleurs|first1=G.|title=Five crucial tests of the cosmic distance scale using the Galaxy as fundamental standard|journal=Nature|date=23 September 1982|volume=299|issue=5881|pages=303–307|doi=10.1038/299303a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.299..303D }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Marc Aaronson]] and co-workers gave values around 80-90 &amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=M.|last2=Bothun|first2=G.|last3=Mould|first3=J.|last4=Huchra|first4=J.|last5=Schommer|first5=R.

== Late 1990s: probable solution ==

The age problem was eventually thought to be resolved by several developments between 1995-2003: firstly, a large program with the [[Hubble space telescope]] measured the Hubble constant at 72&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc with 10 percent uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madore|first1=Barry F.|last2=Freedman|first2=Wendy  L.|last3=Silbermann|first3=N.|last4=Harding|first4=Paul|last5=Huchra|first5=John|last6=Mould|first6=Jeremy R.|last7=Graham|first7=John A.|last8=Ferrarese|first8=Laura|last9=Gibson|first9=Brad K.|last10=Han|first10=Mingsheng|last11=Hoessel|first11=John G.|last12=Hughes|first12=Shaun M.|last13=Illingworth|first13=Garth D.|last14=Phelps|first14=Randy|last15=Sakai|first15=Shoko|last16=Stetson|first16=Peter|title=The Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.

The presence of dark energy implies that the universe was expanding more slowly at around half its present age than today, which makes the universe older for a given value of the Hubble constant.  The combination of the three results above essentially removed the discrepancy between estimated globular cluster ages and the age of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krauss, Lawrence M. |author2=Chaboyer, Brian |title=Age Estimates of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way: Constraints on Cosmology |journal=Science |date=3 January 2003 |volume=299 |issue=5603 |pages=65&amp;ndash;69 |bibcode=2003Sci...299...65K |doi=10.1126/science.1075631 |pmid=12511641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmic latte''' is a name assigned to the average color of the [[universe]], found by a team of [[astronomers]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 2001, [[Karl Glazebrook]] and Ivan Baldry determined that the average color of the universe was a greenish white, but they soon corrected their analysis in a 2002 paper in which they reported that their survey of the light from over 200,000 [[galaxy|galaxies]] averaged to a slightly [[beige]]ish [[white]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldry|first=Ivan K.|last2=Glazebrook|first2=Karl|last3=Baugh|first3=Carlton M.|last4=Bland‐hawthorn|first4=Joss|last5=Bridges|first5=Terry|last6=Cannon|first6=Russell|last7=Cole|first7=Shaun|last8=Colless|first8=Matthew|last9=Collins|first9=Chris|year=2002|title=The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: Constraints on Cosmic Star Formation History from the Cosmic Spectrum|publisher=The American Astronomical Society|publication-date=20 April 2002|volume=569|issue=2|pages=582–594|doi=10.1086/339477|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|periodical=The Astrophysical Journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0110676|bibcode=2002ApJ...569..582B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hex Triplet|hex triplet]] value for cosmic latte is #FFF8E7.

==Discovery of the color==

Finding the average color of the universe was not the focus of the study. Rather, the study examined spectral analysis of different galaxies to study [[star]] formation. Like [[Fraunhofer lines]], the dark lines displayed in the study's spectral ranges display older and younger stars and allow Glazebrook and Baldry to determine the age of different galaxies and star systems. What the study revealed is that the overwhelming majority of stars formed about 5 billion years ago. Because these stars would have been "brighter" in the past, the color of the universe changes over time shifting from blue to red as more blue stars change to yellow and eventually [[red giants]].

As light from distant galaxies reaches the Earth, the average "color of the universe" (as seen from Earth) tends towards pure white, due to the light coming from the stars when they were much younger and bluer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/Cosmic-Spectrum.html|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|last=Glazebrook|first=Karl|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of the color===
The corrected color was initially published on the Johns Hopkins News website and updated on the team's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/press/color.html|title=Headlines@Hopkins: Johns Hopkins University News Releases|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple news outlets, including [[NPR]] and [[BBC News|BBC]], displayed the color in stories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/jan/aas/020110.aas.html|title=NPR : The Color of the Universe Is...|last=Valentine|first=Vikki|website=www.npr.org|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some relayed the request by Glazebrook on the announcement asking for suggestions for names, jokingly adding all were welcome as long as they were not "beige".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1861957.stm|title=Universe is off colour|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2002|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/03/universe-beige-not-turquoise/|title=Universe: Beige, not Turquoise|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the results of a vote of the scientists involved based on the new color:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|date=2002-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021005185037/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|archive-date=2002-10-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Drum's suggestion of "cappuccino cosmico" received the most votes, the researchers favored Drum's other suggestion, "cosmic latte". This is because the similar "Latteo" means "Milky" in Italian, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] native language. It also leads to the similarity to the Italian term for the Milky Way, "Via Lattea", and they enjoyed the fact that the color would be similar to the Milky Way's average color as well, as it is part of the sum of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/07/01/science/6faba612-7ee5-49bf-a652-6a0eae42d7c5/|title=SCIENCE|date=2002-07-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed to be "caffeine biased".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Drum came up with the name while sitting in a [[Starbucks]] drinking a [[latte]] and reading the ''Washington Post''. Drum noticed that the color of the universe as displayed in the newspaper was the same color as his latte.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Cosmic time''' (also known as '''time since the big bang''') is the [[time]] [[coordinate]] commonly used in the [[Big Bang]] models of [[physical cosmology]].  It is defined for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] universes as follows:  Choose a time coordinate so that the universe has the same [[density]] everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous).  Measure the passage of time using [[Clock|clocks]] moving with the [[Hubble flow]].  Choose the big bang singularity as the origin of the time coordinate. 

Cosmic time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|publisher=Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Bonometto|first=Silvio|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0750308109|location=Bristol and Philadelphia|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero [[Peculiar velocity#Cosmology|peculiar velocity]] in the absence of matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time dilation due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe. 

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time) or alternatively, take the [[Big Bang]] as &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; (also referred to as age of the universe). The big bang doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as ΛCDM. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age. 

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker metric|Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

[[File:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe originally expanded from high or infinite density, is widely accepted by physicists.]]
'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">'''Dynamical dimensional reduction''' or '''spontaneous dimensional reduction''' is the apparent reduction in the number of spacetime dimensions as a function of the distance scale, or conversely the energy scale, with which spacetime is probed. At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, G. Z. Phys. 15 (1914) 504.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales. 
== Evidence for dimensional reduction==
The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory,&lt;ref&gt;Atick, J. J. Witten, E.; [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901514?via%3Dihub The Hagedorn Transition and the Number of Degrees of Freedom of String Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; causal dynamical triangulations,&lt;ref&gt;Ambjorn, J. Jurkiewicz, J. Loll, R.; [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.171301 Spectral Dimension of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt; renormalization group approaches,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauscher, O. M. Reuter, E.; [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050/meta Fractal Spacetime Structure in Asymptotically Safe Gravity].&lt;/ref&gt; noncommutative geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, D.; Fractal properties of quantum spacetime [https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1396 arXiv:0811.1396].&lt;/ref&gt; loop quantum gravity&lt;ref&gt;Modesto, L.; Fractal Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2214 arXiv:0812.2214].&lt;/ref&gt; and Horava-Lifshitz gravity&lt;ref&gt;Horava, P.; Spectral Dimension of the Universe in Quantum Gravity at a Lifshitz Point [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3657 arXiv:0902.3657].&lt;/ref&gt; all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. 

The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the [[Causal_dynamical_triangulation|causal dynamical triangulation]] (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ± 0.27 at small distances.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N. Jurkiewicz, J.; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP03%282015%29151 Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal Dynamical Triangulations,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7712 arXiv:1411.7712].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  

== Possible explanations ==

The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. 

One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3329 arXiv:0909.3329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Dimension and Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05417 arXiv:1705.05417].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiriou, T. Visser, M. Weinfurtner, S.; From dispersion relations to spectral dimension - and back again [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6098 arXiv:1105.6098].&lt;/ref&gt; Given such radical consequences, an alternative proposal is that dimensional reduction should not be taken literally, but should instead be viewed as a hint of new Planck scale physics.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124040 Hypothesis on the nature of time,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04320 arXiv:1502.04320].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021827181750119X Quantum gravity without vacuum dispersion,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02519 arXiv:1512.02519].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur
" ''[[Encyclopaedia Perthensis]]'' Volume 19, 391-497. Edinburgh: John Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1839). "On the culture of potatoes". ''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B. Chen, and Y.W. Zhao. (2012). "Ecosystem Health Assessment of Baiyangdian Lake Based on Thermodynamic Indicators." ''Procedia Environmental Sciences'' 12: 2402–2413.&lt;/ref&gt; seas,&lt;ref&gt;HELCOM  (2010). ''Ecosystem health of the Baltic Sea 2003–2007'' HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment.Balt. Sea Environ.

''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America’s ecosystems using criticality and information theory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies "good", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.&lt;ref name=wicklum1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1992)." Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts." ''Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health'' 1:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of human health and well-being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much [[environmental damage]].&lt;ref name=wilkins1999 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). "Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism." ''Conservation Biology'' 9:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers "may be reluctant to define their goals clearly."&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt;
* It is a vague concept.&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). "Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems." ''Estuaries and Coasts'' 38:1202-1212&lt;/ref&gt; "Currently there are many, often contradictory, definitions of ecosystem health,"&lt;ref name=lackey2001&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2001). "Values, Policy, and Ecosystem Health." ''BioScience'' 51(6):437-443&lt;/ref&gt; that "are open to so much abuse and misuse that they represent a threat to the environment."&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;
* "There are in general no clear definitions of what proponents of the concept mean by 'ecosystem'."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;
* The public can be deceived by the term ecosystem health which may camouflage the ramifications of a policy goal and be employed to pejoratively rank policy choices.&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; "The most pervasive misuse of ecosystem health and similar normative notions is insertion of personal values under the guise of 'scientific' impartiality."&lt;ref name=lackey2003 /&gt;

Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,&lt;ref&gt;Link, Jason S. (2002) "What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?" ''Fisheries'' 27:18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in  Hodge, Tony et al. ''Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress''. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy.&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is  to "express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems.&lt;ref name=suter1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; An example of a policy statement is "The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1995). ''Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island'', 18 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a goal is "Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ."&lt;ref name=grumbine1994 /&gt; An example of a management objective is "Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99."&lt;ref name=horns2003 /&gt;

Kurt Jax&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

== Related terms ==

[[Ecological health]] has been used as a medical term in reference to human allergy and multiple chemical sensitivity&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Gail (2001). ''Living with multiple chemical sensitivity. '' North Carolina: McFarland and Company, 296 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a [[public health]] term for programs to modify health risks (diabetes, obesity, smoking, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;"Implementing the ecological approach in tobacco control programs: results of a case study."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">'''Energoland''' is an information centre for energy and electricity generation which was opened by [[Slovenské elektrárne]] on 14 October 2014 at [[Mochovce]], [[Slovakia]], at the site of the nuclear power plant. It is situated between Levice and Nitra. The centre mainly serves the schools and public. The entry is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/reservations&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was awarded as an excellent communication project at the PIME conference and evaluated as a five-star training centre by Laura Elizabeth Kennedy, governor of the United States of America in the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and chargé d'affaires of permanent representation of the USA in international organisation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/iaea-governor-energoland-is-a-5-star-education-centre/156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exposition ==
In Energoland, there are more than thirty objects, applications, and interactive expositions. Edutainment (blending education and entertainment) at Mochovce offers information on energy, electricity generation, global warming, and carbon burden. In addition, visitors learn about the energy mix, electricity grid dispatching, or about the radiation around us. The exposition also focuses on power industry, not only with respect to safety and radioactive waste but also dealing with the fuel cycle, nanowolrd of atoms, and Cherenkov radiation. Some of the specialities include the 3D cinema with its own movie Energy Odyssey, a model of emission-free motorcycle, interactive LED floor or thermal mirror, and mobile application using augmented reality, "Energoland",&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.sk.strategic.EnergolandAR&lt;/ref&gt; downloadable from Google Play or AppStore. Through the Energy Map, various facts and statistics can be searched which are directly shown in the map of the world with the highlighted countries.
Energoland also wants its visitors to make their own opinion of the electricity generation and its sources. Therefore, it does not provide information only about nuclear energy but it also brings knowledge about other sources: water, sun, wind, geothermal energy, or fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/exposition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/energoland-opened-by-slovenske-elektrarne/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/gallery/energoland-new-dimension-of-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Energoland ==
The design of the building is the work of Ing. arch. Viktor Šabík (BARAK Architekti) who, together with the QEX Company and Italian agency Piter Design, designed the interior of Energoland, as well.[2] The total area of the building, including the training rooms and offices is 2,000 square metres; the info centre itself takes up the area of 600 m2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/data/education/126/file/cfakepathe-atom-10-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Activities ==
Energoland is not only a visitor and information centre; it also serves as a training centre for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne and provides office areas. There are many events for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne or public taking place here, such as the 90 reactor-years anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/90-reaktorrokov-jadrovych-blokov-slovenskych-elektrarni/140&lt;/ref&gt; programme within the national round of Olympics in Physics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/mladi-fyzici-na-olympiade-v-atomovej-elektrarni/162&lt;/ref&gt; Science Talks during the Science and Technology Week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/slovenske-elektrarne-hlavnym-partnerom-tvt/130&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Development Conference in May 2015, etc.

In [[physics]], '''energy''' is the [[physical quantity|quantitative]] [[physical property|property]] that must be [[#Energy transfer|transferred]] to an [[Physical body|object]] in order to perform [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on, or to [[heat]], the object.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[second law of thermodynamics]] imposes limitations on the capacity of a system to transfer energy by performing work, since some of the system's energy might necessarily be {{em|[[waste heat|consumed]]}} in the form of [[heat]] instead. See e.g. {{cite journal |last1=Lehrman |first1=Robert L. |title=Energy Is Not The Ability To Do Work |journal=The Physics Teacher |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages=15–18 |issn=0031-921X |doi=10.1119/1.2349846|bibcode=1973PhTea..11...15L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]; the law of [[conservation of energy]] states that energy can be [[Energy transformation|converted]] in form, but not created or destroyed. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of energy is the [[joule]], which is the energy transferred to an object by the [[work (physics)|work]] of moving it a distance of 1 [[metre]] against a [[force]] of 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]].

Common forms of energy include the [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object, the [[potential energy]] stored by an object's position in a force [[Classical field theory|field]] ([[gravitational field|gravitational]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]]), the [[elastic energy]] stored by stretching solid objects, the [[chemical energy]] released when a fuel [[combustion|burns]], the [[radiant energy]] carried by light, and the [[thermal energy]] due to an object's [[temperature]].

[[Mass]] and energy are closely related. Due to [[mass–energy equivalence]], any object that has mass when stationary (called [[rest mass]]) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called [[rest mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough [[weighing scale|scale]].

Living organisms require [[available energy]] to stay alive, such as the [[Food energy|energy humans get from food]].  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  [[energy resource]]s such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[nuclear fuel]], or [[renewable energy]]. The processes of Earth's [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]] are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the [[geothermal energy]] contained within the earth.

[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania zoom.jpg|thumb|In a typical [[lightning]] strike, 500 [[megajoule]]s of [[electric potential energy]] is converted into the same amount of energy in other forms, mostly [[light energy]], [[sound energy]] and [[thermal energy]].]]
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal energy]] is energy of microscopic constituents of matter, which may include both [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]].]]

The total energy of a [[system]] can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. [[Kinetic energy]] is determined by the [[motion (physics)|movement]] of an object – or the [[statistical mechanics|composite motion]] of the components of an object – and [[potential energy]] reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a [[Field (physics)|field]] or may stored in the field itself.

While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic [[mechanical energy]] is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the [[nuclear force]] and the [[weak force]]), among others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] – the first to use the term "energy" in the modern sense.]]
The word ''energy'' derives from the {{lang-grc|ἐνέργεια|[[energeia]]|activity, operation}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |title=Energy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122441/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which possibly appears for the first time in the work of [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] proposed the idea of the {{lang-lat|[[vis viva]]}}, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, [[kinetic energy]], differs from ''vis viva'' only by a factor of two.

In 1807, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was possibly the first to use the term "energy" instead of ''vis viva'', in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy – a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-226-76420-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described "[[kinetic energy]]" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term "[[potential energy]]". The law of [[conservation of energy]] was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any [[isolated system]]. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the [[caloric theory|caloric]], or merely a physical quantity, such as [[momentum]]. In 1845 [[James Prescott Joule]] discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) as the field of [[thermodynamics]]. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jožef Stefan]]. According to [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.&lt;ref name="jphysics"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lofts| first =G|author2=O'Keeffe D |display-authors=etal | title=Jacaranda Physics 1| publisher =John Willey &amp; Sons Australia Ltd. | year =2004| location = Milton, Queensland, Australia| page = 286| chapter=11 – Mechanical Interactions| edition=2| isbn=978-0-7016-3777-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate variables|conjugate]] to energy, namely time.

==Units of measure==
[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]
{{Main article|Units of energy}}

In 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the "Joule apparatus": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule. It is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]. It is equal to the energy expended (or [[Work (physics)|work]] done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as [[erg]]s, [[calorie]]s, [[British Thermal Unit]]s, [[kilowatt-hour]]s and [[kilocalorie]]s, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the [[watt]], which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] energy unit is the [[erg]] and the [[imperial and US customary measurement systems|imperial and US customary]] unit is the [[foot pound]]. Other energy units such as the [[electronvolt]], [[food calorie]] or thermodynamic [[kilocalorie|kcal]] (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and [[British thermal unit|BTU]] are used in specific areas of science and commerce.

==Scientific use==

===Classical mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics}}
{{Main article|Mechanics|Mechanical work|Thermodynamics}}

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a [[conserved quantity]]. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.

[[Work (physics)|Work]], a function of energy, is force times distance.

: &lt;math&gt; W = \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

This says that the work (&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;) is equal to the [[line integral]] of the [[force]] '''F''' along a path ''C''; for details see the [[mechanical work]] article. Work and thus energy is [[frame dependent]]. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]], after [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135413/http://www.sustech.edu/OCWExternal/Akamai/18/18.013a/textbook/HTML/chapter16/section03.html The Hamiltonian] MIT OpenCourseWare website 18.013A Chapter 16.3 Accessed February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another energy-related concept is called the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of [[classical mechanics]], but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy ''minus'' the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).

[[Noether's theorem]] (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.

===Chemistry===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (chemistry)]] links here --&gt;
In the context of [[Chemistry#Energy|chemistry]], energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic]] reactions the situation is the reverse. [[Chemical reaction]]s are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T'') is related to the activation energy&amp;nbsp;''E'', by the Boltzmann's population factor&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;−''E''/''kT''&lt;/sup&gt;{{spaced ndash}}that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to&amp;nbsp;''E'' at the given temperature&amp;nbsp;''T''. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]
{{anchor|Biology}}In [[biology#Energy|biology]], energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living [[organism]]. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or an [[organelle]] of a biological [[organism]]. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when reacted with [[oxygen]] in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In human terms, the [[human equivalent]] (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human [[metabolism]], assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500&amp;nbsp;kJ per day and a [[basal metabolic rate]] of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |title=Retrieved on May-29-09 |publisher=Uic.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604191319/http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a "feel" for the use of a given amount of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Bicycle calculator – speed, weight, wattage etc. {{cite web |url=http://bikecalculator.com/ |title=Bike Calculator |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513091201/http://bikecalculator.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as ''chemical potential energy'' in [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an [[electron acceptor]], to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by [[enzyme]] action.

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy – radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals – to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000&amp;nbsp;[[kilocalorie|Calories]] (6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which [[glucose]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[stearin]] (C&lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;110&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]] in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]
::&lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6O2 -&gt; 6CO2 + 6H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

and some of the energy is used to convert [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] into [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].
::ADP + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ATP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work:&lt;ref group=note&gt;These examples are solely for illustration, as it is not the energy available for work which limits the performance of the athlete but the [[power (physics)|power]] output of the sprinter and the [[force (physics)|force]] of the weightlifter. A worker stacking shelves in a supermarket does more work (in the physical sense) than either of the athletes, but does it more slowly.&lt;/ref&gt;
:gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100&amp;nbsp;m race: 4&amp;nbsp;kJ
:gain in gravitational potential energy of a 150&amp;nbsp;kg weight lifted through 2&amp;nbsp;metres: 3&amp;nbsp;kJ
:Daily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8&amp;nbsp;MJ

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficient (in the physical sense)]] in their use of the energy they receive (chemical or radiant energy), and it is true that most real [[machine]]s manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe ("the surroundings").&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Crystal]]s are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a large amount of heat (known as the [[lattice energy]]) to the surroundings.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy [[ecological niche]]s that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in [[ecology]]: to take just the first step in the [[food chain]], of the estimated 124.7&amp;nbsp;Pg/a of carbon that is [[carbon fixation|fixed]] by [[photosynthesis]], 64.3&amp;nbsp;Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants,&lt;ref&gt;Ito, Akihito; Oikawa, Takehisa (2004).

===Earth sciences===
In [[Earth science#earth's energy|geology]], [[continental drift]], [[mountain|mountain ranges]], [[volcano]]es, and [[earthquake]]s are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth's interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |title=Earth's Energy Budget |publisher=Okfirst.ocs.ou.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827194704/http://okfirst.ocs.ou.edu/train/meteorology/EnergyBudget.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[metereology|meteorological]] phenomena like wind, rain, [[hail]], snow, lightning, [[tornado]]es and [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] are all a result of energy transformations brought about by [[solar energy]] on the [[atmosphere]] of the planet Earth.

Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.

In a slower process, [[radioactive decay]] of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives [[plate tectonics]] and may lift mountains, via [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (cosmology)]] links here --&gt;
In [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|cosmology and astronomy]] the phenomena of [[star]]s, [[nova]], [[supernova]], [[quasar]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All [[wikt:stellar|stellar]] phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the [[Big Bang]]. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{Main article|Energy operator}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy is defined in terms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy operator]]
as a time derivative of the [[wave function]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) [[wave function]] of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]]. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by [[Planck's relation]]: &lt;math&gt;E = h\nu&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or [[photon]]s.

===Relativity===
When calculating kinetic energy ([[Mechanical work|work]] to accelerate a [[mass|massive body]] from zero [[speed]] to some finite speed) relativistically – using [[Lorentz transformations]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics]] – Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it [[rest energy]]: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:

:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m c^2 &lt;/math&gt;,
where
:''m'' is the mass of the body,
:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,
:''&lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the rest energy.

For example, consider [[electron]]–[[positron]] annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their [[invariant mass|rest mass]]) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process – the inverse process is called [[pair creation]] – in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.

In general relativity, the [[stress–energy tensor]] serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.&lt;ref name="MTW"/&gt;

Energy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system ("mass manifestations"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating ("energy manifestations"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.

In [[classical physics]], energy is a scalar quantity, the [[canonical conjugate]] to time. In [[special relativity]] energy is also a scalar (although not a [[Lorentz scalar]] but a time component of the [[energy–momentum 4-vector]]).&lt;ref name="MTW"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Misner, Thorne, Wheeler |title=Gravitation |year=1973 |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of [[space]], but not invariant with respect to rotations of [[space-time]] (= [[Lorentz boost|boosts]]).

==Transformation==
{{Main article|Energy transformation}}

{{Forms of energy transfer}}
[[File:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| A [[turbo generator]] transforms the energy of pressurised steam into electrical energy]]
Energy may be [[energy transformation|transformed]] between different forms at various [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]]. Items that transform between these forms are called [[transducer]]s. Examples of transducers include a battery, from [[chemical energy]] to [[electric energy]]; a dam: [[gravitational potential energy]] to [[kinetic energy]] of moving water (and the blades of a [[turbine]]) and ultimately to [[electric energy]] through an [[electric generator]]; or a [[heat engine]], from heat to work.

Examples of energy transformation include generating [[electric energy]] from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms [[nuclear potential energy]] to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as [[radiant energy]].

There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into [[Work (physics)|work]] in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by [[entropy]] (equal energy spread among all available [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the [[Big Bang]] later being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes (such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]), by [[nucleosynthesis]], a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the [[gravitational collapse]] of [[supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear [[fission bomb]]s or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a [[Chemical explosive|chemical explosion]], [[chemical potential]] energy is transformed to [[kinetic energy]] and [[thermal energy]] in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a [[pendulum]]. At its highest points the [[kinetic energy]] is zero and the [[gravitational potential energy]] is at maximum. At its lowest point the [[kinetic energy]] is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of [[potential energy]]. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no [[friction]] or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the [[pendulum]] would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (&lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt;) to kinetic energy (&lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt;) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The equation can then be simplified further since &lt;math&gt;E_p = mgh&lt;/math&gt; (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt; (half&amp;nbsp;mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding &lt;math&gt;E_p + E_k = E_{total}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Conservation of energy and mass in transformation===
Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², derived by [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by [[J.J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Henri Poincaré]] (1900), [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] (1904) and others (see [[Mass-energy equivalence#History]] for further information).

Part of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of [[matter]] may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt; is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1&amp;nbsp;kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~&lt;math&gt;9\times 10^{16}&lt;/math&gt; joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].

===Reversible and non-reversible transformations===
Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]] and [[irreversible process]]es. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic [[heat death of the universe]]. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a [[heat engine]], or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.

==Conservation of energy==
{{Main article|Conservation of energy}}
The fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of [[conservation of energy]].  In the form of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], this states that a [[closed system]]'s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or [[heat]], and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Physics Course Volume 1. Charles Kittel, Walter D Knight and Malvin A Ruderman&lt;/ref&gt;

While heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in [[heat engine]]s the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the system doing work always loses some energy as [[waste heat]]. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the [[available energy]]. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into [[thermal energy]] without such limitations.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"/&gt; The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.

[[Richard Feynman]] said during a 1961 lecture:&lt;ref name="RPF1"/&gt;
{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a ''law'', governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law – it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the ''[[conservation of energy]]''. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''}}

Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws |publisher=Physics.ucla.edu |date=1918-07-16 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514080739/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa.&lt;ref name="thermo-laws"&gt;[http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm ''The Laws of Thermodynamics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215201900/http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-laws.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} including careful definitions of energy, free energy, et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RPF1"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics; Volume 1|year=1964|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=U.S.A| isbn=978-0-201-02115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of [[translational symmetry]] of time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |title=Time Invariance |publisher=Ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210455/http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week9/timeinvariance.html |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is [[canonical conjugate]] to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system [[mass]], whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In [[quantum mechanics]] energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 } &lt;/math&gt;

which is similar in form to the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since ''H'' and ''t'' are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In [[particle physics]], this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of [[virtual particles]] which carry [[momentum]], exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known [[fundamental forces]] (more accurately known as [[fundamental interactions]]). [[Virtual photons]] (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical [[energy state]] of [[photon]]s) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between [[electric charge]]s (which results in [[Coulomb law]]), for [[Spontaneous fission|spontaneous]] radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the [[Casimir force]], for [[van der Waals force|van der Waals bond forces]] and some other observable phenomena.

==Energy transfer==
===Closed systems===
Energy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are [[closed system|closed]] to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by [[conservative force]]s over a distance is measured as the [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called [[heat]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although heat is "wasted" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see: [[waste heat]]) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be "recycled" from such recovery processes is limited by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of [[electromagnetic energy]] via photons, physical collisions which transfer [[kinetic energy]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], but it is very common to simplify the interaction by ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and end result.&lt;/ref&gt; and the conductive transfer of [[thermal energy]].

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]:&lt;ref group=note&gt;There are several [[First law of thermodynamics#Description|sign conventions for this equation]]. Here, the signs in this equation follow the IUPAC convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of energy transferred, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; represents the work done on the system, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; represents the heat flow into the system. As a simplification, the heat term, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, is sometimes ignored, especially when the [[thermal efficiency]] of the transfer is high.

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This simplified equation is the one used to define the [[joule]], for example.

===Open systems===
Beyond the constraints of closed systems, [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open systems]] can gain or lose energy in association with matter transfer (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Denoting this energy by &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, one may write

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\Delta{}E = W + Q + E .&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

==Thermodynamics==

===Internal energy===
[[Internal energy]] is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

===First law of thermodynamics===
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] asserts that energy (but not necessarily [[thermodynamic free energy]]) is always conserved&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kittel and Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics |year=1980|publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=New York| isbn=978-0-7167-1088-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to [[pressure]] forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a ''gain'' in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;,

where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of [[temperature]] ''T'' and [[entropy]] ''S'' (in which entropy increases and the change d''S'' is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is ''P'' and volume ''V'' (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d''V'', is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as [[advection]] of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a ''closed'' system is expressed in a general form by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}E=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat supplied to the system and &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt; is the work applied to the system.

===Equipartition of energy===
The energy of a mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]] (a mass on a spring) is alternatively [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential]]. At two points in the oscillation [[Frequency|cycle]] it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called [[equipartition principle]]; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called [[entropy]]. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available [[energy state]]s that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between "new" and "old" degrees. This mathematical result is called the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in [[equilibrium state]]. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system’s behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of [[principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=L.|title=Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.|journal=Phys.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

[[File:Humility and struggle.jpg|thumb|Woman carrying wood and her baby in [[Uganda]]]]
'''Exertion''' is the [[Action (physics)|physical]] or perceived use of [[energy]].&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Newton's Third Law, Elert, Glenn. “Forces.” ''Viscosity – The Physics Hypertextbook'', physics.info/newton-first/.&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly ''effort,''resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion,&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; or in the performance of [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It often relates to [[Exercise physiology|muscular]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response.

==Physical==
In [[physics]], ''exertion'' is the expenditure of [[energy]] against, or inductive of, [[inertia]] as described by [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|third law of motion]]. In physics, '''force''' exerted equivocates '''work''' done.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Perceived Exertion, Barry, A. J. (1967). Physical activity and psychic stress/strain. ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', ''96''(12), 848–853.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Energy.html|title=Work and energy|website=physics.bu.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; In [[mechanics]] it describes the use of [[force]] against a [[Physical body|body]] in the direction of its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] (see [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]).

==Physiological==
Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood [[Lactate dehydrogenase|lactate]] concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] strength, as well as metabolic capability.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Kumar, Shrawan. “Theories of Occupational Musculoskeletal Injury Causation.” ''Biomechanics in Ergonomics, Second Edition'', July 2007, doi:10.1201/9780849379093.sec1.&lt;/ref&gt; This often correlates to an output of force followed by a [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Muscular energy reserves, or stores for [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and increased O2 consumption.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Golgi Tendon Organ.” ''Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics'', Elsevier, www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/golgi-tendon-organ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A [[rating of perceived exertion]], as measured by the ''RPE-scale'', or [[Borg scale]], is a quantitative measure of physical exertion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=Gunnar A.V|date=|title=Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion|url=http://fcesoftware.com/images/15_Perceived_Exertion.pdf|journal=Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gröpel, Peter, et al. “Endurance- and Resistance-Trained Men Exhibit Lower Cardiovascular Responses to Psychosocial Stress Than Untrained Men.” ''Frontiers in Psychology'', vol. 9, Jan. 2018, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00852.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year.{{Clarify|reason=when, where|date=November 2018}} An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Indications Of Physical Overexertion.” ''JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 71, no. 18, Feb. 1918, p. 1488., doi:10.1001/jama.1918.02600440040013.&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;“The Understated Injury: Overexertion.” ''Healthline'', Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/health/understated-injury-overexertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the [[Logarithmic timeline|logarithmic scale]] is used for such timelines but it compresses the most interesting Stelliferous Era too much as [[Future of an expanding universe#Graphical timeline|this]] example shows. Therefore, a [[Logarithm#Related operations and generalizations|double-logarithmic]] scale ''s'' (''s*100'' in the graphics) is used instead. The minimum of it is only 1, not 0 as needed, and the negative outputs for inputs smaller than 10 are useless. Therefore, the time from 0.1 to 10 years is collapsed to a single point 0, but that does not matter in this case because nothing special happens in the history of the universe during that time.

: &lt;math&gt; s =
 \begin{cases}
 \log_{10} \log_{10} year &amp; \mbox{if } year &gt; 10 \mbox{ , corresponding to } year = 10^{10^{s}} \\
 0 &amp; \mbox{if } 0.1 \le year \le 10 \\
 -\log_{10} (-\log_{10} year) &amp; \mbox{if } year &lt; 0.1 \mbox{ , corresponding to } year = 10^{-10^{-s}}
 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert −30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

{{duplication}}&lt;!--what is the point of keeping two timelines with exactly the same scope, one "graphical" and the other in html table format?--&gt;
This more than 20-billion-year '''timeline of our universe''' shows the best estimates of major events from the universe's beginning to anticipated future events. Zero on the scale is the present day. A large step on the scale is one billion years; a small step, one hundred million years. The past is denoted by a minus sign: e.g., the oldest rock on Earth was formed about four billion years ago and this is marked at -4e+09 years, where 4e+09 represents 4 times 10 to the power of 9. The "[[Big Bang]]" event most likely happened 13.8 billion years ago; see [[age of the universe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km.

Margham also has an oil production capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/oil-in-dubai-history-timeline-1.578333|title=Oil in Dubai: History &amp; timeline|last=archives|first=Gulf News|date=2010-02-04|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level. The field is connected by pipeline to Jebel Ali, where the gas condensate is loaded onto tankers for export. Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/01/10/10181701/uae-bets-on-alternative-energy-local-gas-production/|title=UAE bets on alternative energy, local gas production|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margham was initially developed as a liquids stripping/gas recycling project (dry gas was pumped back into the reservoir),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodmac.com/reports/upstream-oil-and-gas-margham-field-gas-storage-project-1770930|title=Margham Field Gas Storage Project|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now operates as a gas storage facility for Dubai since 2008, allowing Dubai to depend on gas produced from Margham for its elecricity generation and desalination needs. This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Although it is a major producer with ambitions to develop its trading activities to become a major global LNG hub, the UAE is actually a net importer of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/dubai-supply-authority-agrees-deal-with-japan-s-jera-to-explore-lng-opportunities-1.19125|title=Dubai Supply Authority agrees deal with Japan’s Jera to explore LNG opportunities|work=The National|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

The effect has also been used to explain the spatial version of the [[quantum Zeno effect]], in which an otherwise unstable object may be stabilised by rapidly repeated observations.&lt;ref name="zeno"/&gt;

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects. In 1999, a research team in [[Vienna]] demonstrated diffraction for molecules as large as [[fullerene]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Wave-particle duality of C60| first=M.| last=Arndt| author2=O.

Still one step further than Louis De Broglie go theories which in quantum mechanics eliminate the concept of a pointlike classical particle and explain the observed facts by means of wavepackets of matter waves alone.&lt;ref&gt;See section VI(e) of Everett's thesis: ''The Theory of the Universal Wave Function'', in [[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], [[R.

==de Broglie relations&lt;!--This section is linked to by [[de Broglie relations]]--&gt;==
The de Broglie equations relate the [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}} to the [[momentum]] {{math|''p''}}, and [[frequency]] {{math|''f''}} to the total energy {{math|''E''}} of a particle:&lt;ref name="Resnick 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles |edition=2nd |first=R. |last=Resnick |first2=R. |last2=Eisberg |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=1985 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-87373-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \lambda = h/p\\
&amp; f = E/h

&amp; E = \hbar \omega\\

In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the [[Planck–Einstein relation]], since it was also proposed by [[Max Planck|Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]].

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009). ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}, pp. 30–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

The '''natural environment''' encompasses all [[life|living]] and non-living things occurring [[nature|naturally]], meaning in this case not [[Artificiality|artificial]]. The term is most often applied to the [[Earth]] or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living [[species]], [[climate]], weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.

The concept of the ''natural environment'' can be distinguished as components:
* Complete [[ecological units]] that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, [[microorganism]]s, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries and their nature. 
* Universal [[natural resource]]s and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as [[energy]], [[radiation]], [[electric charge]], and [[magnetism]], not originating from civilized human actions

In contrast to the natural environment is the [[built environment]]. In such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [[land development|land conversion]], the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment.  Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud [[hut]] or a [[photovoltaic system]] in the [[desert]], the modified environment becomes an artificial one.  Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence [[beaver dam|beaver dams,]] and the works of [[Mound-building termites]], are thought of as natural.

People seldom find ''absolutely natural'' environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from  100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Symons |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=31 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-502535-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the [[mineralogy|mineralogic composition]] and the [[soil structure|structure]] of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.

==Geological activity==
{{Main|Geology}}
The Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], or [[lithosphere]], is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It has been generated greatly by [[igneous]] processes in which [[magma]]  cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of [[radioactive element]]s. The mantle though solid is in a state of [[rheid|rheic]] [[convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]]. [[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of [[Subduction|subducted]] crust material or of rising mantle at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.

==Water on Earth==

An [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface of the Earth|surface]] (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714233027/http://www.pagejaffna.com/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}".

A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely before reaching another body of water. 
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Rocky stream in the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]]]]

The water in a river is usually in a [[channel (geography)|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of water stored in [[glacier]]s and snowpacks.

Small rivers may also be termed by several other names, including [[stream]], creek and brook.  Their [[Current (stream)|current]] is confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s.  Streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as ''surface [[hydrology]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813113503/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ |date=August 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lakes ===
[[File:LAGO LACAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lácar Lake]], of [[glacier|glacial]] origin, in the {{province|Neuquén|Argentina}}.]]

{{Main|Lake}}

A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]], a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]].  A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [[ocean]], and is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Lake (physical feature)
|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Everglades Park swamp.JPG|thumb|left|A [[swamp]] area in [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], [[US]].]]

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in [[mountain]]ous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
{{clear}}

==== Ponds ====
{{Main|Pond}}
A pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

=== Human impact on water ===
Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=203 - 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for humans, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.&lt;ref name=Goudie/&gt;

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate &amp; Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

The [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

===Layers of the Atmosphere===
{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}

====Principal layers====
Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:
* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.
* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.
* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.

; Other layers
Within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties.
* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.
* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.
* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.
* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]].

====Effects of global warming====
[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The Retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]].]]
{{Main|Effects of global warming}}

The potential dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly.–This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Efforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]]. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include:

[[File:Aletschgletsjer Zwitserland.JPG|right|thumb|Another view of the [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] and because of [[global warming]] it has been decreasing]]
* The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention Treaty]] and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html Kyoto Protocol] from [http://unfccc.int/2860.php United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change], Retrieved August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Western Climate Initiative]], to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/ Western Climate Initiative], Retrieved on Feb 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study.

===Climate===
[[File:ClimateMap World.png|alt=Map of world dividing climate zones, largely influenced by latitude.

{{Main|Climate}}

[[Climate]] looks at the statistics of [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[wind]], [[rainfall]], atmospheric particle count and  other [[Meteorology|meteorological]] elements in a given region over long periods of time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6cRTp4enDxkC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=Climate+encompasses+the+statistics+of+temperature,+humidity,+atmospheric+pressure,+wind,+rainfall,+atmospheric+particle+count+and+numerous+other+meteorological+elements+in+a+given+region+over+long+periods+of+time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wyxXN9iTz9&amp;sig=0jmCi02gi2jvfOKgwNuhV9dnvdk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSoNHAjqndAhUMGTQIHRTXBqsQ6AEwBHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Climate%20encompasses%20the%20statistics%20of%20temperature,%20humidity,%20atmospheric%20pressure,%20wind,%20rainfall,%20atmospheric%20particle%20count%20and%20numerous%20other%20meteorological%20elements%20in%20a%20given%20region%20over%20long%20periods%20of%20time&amp;f=false|title=Meteorology|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weather]], on the other hand, is the present condition of these same elements over periods up to two weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by [[Wladimir Köppen]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;[[C. W. Thornthwaite]], "An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate", ''Geographical Review'', 38:55-94, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; in use since 1948, uses [[evapotranspiration]] as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of [[climate change]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCs5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=The+Thornthwaite+system,+in+use+since+1948,+incorporates+evapotranspiration+in+addition+to+temperature+and+precipitation+information+and+is+used+in+studying+animal+species+diversity+and+potential+impacts+of+climate+changes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o21x1valsx&amp;sig=L9fJcuBCNchRY8bf7kSRcnWA7VQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi_05vijqndAhXTMn0KHf00BboQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Thornthwaite%20system,%20in%20use%20since%201948,%20incorporates%20evapotranspiration%20in%20addition%20to%20temperature%20and%20precipitation%20information%20and%20is%20used%20in%20studying%20animal%20species%20diversity%20and%20potential%20impacts%20of%20climate%20changes&amp;f=false|title=English for geographers|last=García|first=Carmen Isabel Luján|date=2013-06-19|publisher=Editorial Club Universitario|isbn=9788499485676|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas [[climate]] is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Climate | encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 | accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of [[Earth]].

Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40&amp;nbsp;°C (100&amp;nbsp;°F to −40&amp;nbsp;°F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate

Surface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location. The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]], and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] has inadvertently modified weather patterns.

==Life==
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;There are many [[plant species]] on the planet.&lt;/center&gt;]]

{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}

Evidence suggests that [[life|life on Earth]] has existed for about 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/historyoflife.php History of life through time]". University of California Museum of Paleontology.&lt;/ref&gt; All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s. In [[biology]], the science of living organisms, "life" is the condition which distinguishes active [[organism]]s from [[Inorganic compound|inorganic matter]], including the capacity for growth, [[Physiology|functional activity]] and the continual change preceding death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary. English Edition 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |access-date=2009-06-21 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the [[biosphere]] on [[Earth]], and properties common to these organisms—[[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]—are a [[Carbon-based life|carbon]]- and [[Water and life|water]]-based [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] form with complex [[organization]] and heritable [[gene]]tic information. Living organisms undergo [[metabolism]], maintain [[homeostasis]], possess a capacity to [[Cell growth|grow]], respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], [[reproduce]] and, through [[natural selection]], adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.

==Ecosystems==
[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|left|[[Rainforest]]s often have a great deal of [[biodiversity]] with many plant and animal species. This is the [[Gambia River]] in [[Senegal]]'s [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]].]]
{{Main|Ecosystem}}

An [[ecosystem]] (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[biotic component|biotic]] factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Christopherson |year=1996 |title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-505314-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist. [[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E. P. |year=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=Third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-7216-6941-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creek and old-growth forest-Larch Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old-growth forest]] and a [[creek (tidal)|creek]] on [[Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Larch Mountain]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]] The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]], and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].

A greater number or variety of species or [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus "absorb" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.

The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.

==Biomes==
[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of Terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation.]]
{{Main|Biome}}

[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the [[Earth]], such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to ''as'' ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

==Biogeochemical cycles==

{{Main|Biogeochemical cycles}}

Global [[biogeochemical cycle]]s are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, V. (2000). ''Cycles of Life''. New York: Scientific American Library. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-5079-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nitrogen cycle]] is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.
* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.
* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.
* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.
* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.

{{Main|Wilderness}}

[[Wilderness]] is generally defined as a natural environment on [[Earth]] that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |title=The WILD Foundation |publisher=Wild.org |accessdate=2013-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204162126/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |archivedate=2012-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

The word, "wilderness", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wilderness wilderness]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being "wilderness." Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered "wild." This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.

[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.

{{See also|List of environmental issues}}
It is the common understanding of ''natural environment'' that underlies [[environmentalism]] — a broad [[politics|political]], [[sociology|social]], and [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, ''wild'' nature (e.g., unmanaged [[forests]], uncultivated [[grasslands]], [[wildlife]], [[wildflower]]s) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by [[environmental scientist]]s and [[environmentalist]]s include:

* Elimination of [[pollution]] and [[toxicant]]s in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
* Preservation of [[biodiversity]] and protection of [[endangered species]].
* [[Conservation movement|Conservation]] and [[sustainable use]] of resources such as [[water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Escolero, O. |author2=Kralisch, S. |author3=Martínez, S.E. |author4=Perevochtchikova, M.|year=2016|title=Diagnóstico y análisis de los factores que influyen en la vulnerabilidad de las fuentes de abastecimiento de agua potable a la Ciudad de México, México|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6803/%283%29Escolero.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|language=Spanish|volume=68|issue=3|pages=409–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
* Halting human-induced [[global warming]], which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
* Shifting from [[fossil fuels]] to [[renewable energy]] in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability.  This may include [[public transportation]] and [[distributed generation]], which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
* Establishment of [[nature reserve]]s for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
* Sustainable and less polluting [[waste management]] including [[waste reduction]] (or even [[zero waste]]), [[reuse]], [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[anaerobic digestion]] of sewage sludge.

==Criticism==
In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dale. (2007).

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | first1 = Helmuth-M | last1 = Groscurth
 | date = 1 July 1995
 | title = Design and management of energy databases

 | number = 4
 | pages = 445–457
 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1 = Pfenninger | first1 = Stefan

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
 | date = 15 June 2013
 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12
 | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF
 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | first1 = Lina | last1 = Boecker
 | date = 21 November 2016
 | title = Energy databases: protection and licensing
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwaelte

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie
 | last2 = Brown | first2 = Tom
 | last3 = De Felice | first3 = Matteo
 | title = Submission on the re-use of public sector information: with an emphasis on energy system datasets — Release 09
 | date = 10 December 2017
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/uploads/default/original/1X/d659fda325438884e6e78b372772ed7069633f97.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016
 | publisher = International Energy Agency (IEA)
 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|01}}, the database held 131{{nbsp}}datasets, the great majority related to [[Developing country|developing countries]].  The datasets are tagged and can be easily filtered.  A number of download formats, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]] files, are supported: [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[Office Open XML|XLSX]], [[ArcGIS]], [[Esri]], [[GeoJSON]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], and [[Shapefile|SHP]].  Some datasets are also offered as [[HTML]].  Again, {{as of|lc=yes|2017|01}}, four apps are available.  Some are web-based and run from a browser.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform was originally implemented by the [[University of Flensburg]], [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]], the [[Technical University of Berlin]], and the energy economics consultancy Neon Neue Energieökonomik, all from Germany.  The first phase of the project, from August 2015 to July 2017, was funded by the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy]] (BMWi) for {{val|490000|p=€}}.&lt;ref name="fischer-2015"&gt;

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The same data is usually also provided as [[Office Open XML|XLSX]] ([[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) and [[SQLite]] files.  The datasets can be accessed in real-time using stable [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts deployed for data processing are available on [[GitHub]] and carry an [[MIT license]].  The licensing conditions for the data itself depends on the source and varies in terms of openness.  Previous versions of the datasets and scripts can be recovered in order to track changes or replicate earlier studies.  The project also engages with energy data providers, such as [[transmission system operator]]s (TSO) and [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|ENTSO-E]], to encourage them to make their data available under [[Copyright#Free licences|open licenses]] (for instance, [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] and [[Open Database License|ODbL]] licenses).&lt;ref name="osi-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

Most of the data on OpenEI is exposed as [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).  OpenEI also uses LOD methods to populate its definitions throughout the wiki with real-time connections to [[DBPedia]], [[#reegle|reegle]], and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bauer-and-kaltenboeck-2012"&gt;

OpenGridMap employs [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to gather detailed data on electricity network components and then infer a realistic network structure using methods from [[Correlation and dependence|statistics]] and [[graph theory]].  The scope of the project is worldwide and both distribution and transmission networks can be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].  The project is managed by the Chair of Business Information Systems, [https://www.in.tum.de/en.html TUM Department of Informatics], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and a [[Facebook]] page and provides an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app]] to help the public document electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s and [[Electrical substation|substations]].  The bulk of the data is being made available under a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] {{nowrap|CC BY 3.0 IGO}} license.&lt;ref name="opengridmap-terms-of-use"&gt;

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

The project relies on weather data derived from [[meteorological reanalysis]] models and weather [[Meteosat|satellite images]].  More specifically, it uses the 2016 MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset from [[NASA]]{{nnbsp}}{{efn|name=merra-2}} and satellite images from CM-SAF SARAH.&lt;ref name="mueller-etal-2015"&gt;

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A.

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II.

== Types of pattern ==

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009. Page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a modern understanding of fractals, a growth spiral can be seen as a special case of self-similarity.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=29–32}}

Plant spirals can be seen in [[phyllotaxis]], the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and in the arrangement ([[parastichy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030701/http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/Lattices/SpiralLattices.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=26 May 2010 | title=Spiral Lattices &amp; Parastichy | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=24 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of other parts as in [[compositae|composite]] [[flower|flower heads]] and [[seed|seed heads]] like the [[sunflower]] or [[fruit]] structures like the [[pineapple]]&lt;ref name=Kappraff&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/1904/19040335.pdf | title=Growth in Plants: A Study in Number | author=Kappraff, Jay | journal=Forma | date=2004 | volume=19 | pages=335–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} and [[salak|snake fruit]], as well as in the pattern of scales in [[pine cones]], where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise. These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S. M. |last=Coxeter|author-link =Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher =Wiley|date=1961|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disc phyllotaxis as in the [[sunflower]] and [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], the florets are arranged in [[Fermat's spiral]] with Fibonacci numbering, at least when the flowerhead is mature so all the elements are the same size. Fibonacci ratios approximate the [[golden angle]], 137.508°, which governs the curvature of Fermat's spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prusinkiewicz | first =Przemyslaw | authorlink =Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz |author2=Lindenmayer, Aristid |authorlink2=Aristid Lindenmayer | title =The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants | publisher =Springer-Verlag | date =1990 | pages =101–107 | url =http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#webdocs | isbn = 978-0-387-97297-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the point of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy configurations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levitov LS |title=Energetic Approach to Phyllotaxis |journal=Europhys.

Phyllotaxis is controlled by [[protein]]s that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone [[auxin]], which activates [[meristem]] growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 249–250}} From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Kappraff/&gt;

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

===Pattern formation===
{{main|Pattern formation}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

Patterns can form for other reasons in the [[patterned vegetation|vegetated landscape]] of [[tiger bush]]&lt;ref name=TigerBush&gt;{{cite book | title=Banded vegetation patterning in arid and semiarid environments | publisher=Springer-Verlag | author=Tongway, D.J. | author2=Valentin, C. | author3=Seghieri, J. | last-author-amp=yes | date=2001 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fir wave]]s.&lt;ref name=FirWave&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tiee.esa.org/vol/v1/figure_sets/disturb/disturb_back4.html | title=Fir Waves: Regeneration in New England Conifer Forests | publisher=TIEE | date=22 February 2004 | accessdate=26 May 2012 | author=D'Avanzo, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it.&lt;ref name=TigerBush/&gt; Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.&lt;ref name=FirWave/&gt; Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the [[Mima mounds]] of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of [[pocket gopher]]s,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |last=Morelle |first=Rebecca |title=‘Digital gophers’ solve Mima mound mystery |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25259133 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the so-called [[fairy circle]]s of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=The secret of Namibia's 'fairy circles' may be explained at last|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/18/the-secret-of-namibias-fairy-circles-may-be-explained-at-last|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]] and [[esotericism]], the term "'''physical universe'''" or "'''material universe'''" is used to distinguish the [[nature|physical]] [[matter]] of the [[universe]] from a proposed [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[supernatural]] essence. 

In the [[Book of Veles]], and perhaps in traditional [[Slavic mythology]], the physical universe is referred to as [[Jav, Prav and Nav|Yav]]. [[Gnosticism]] holds that the physical universe was created by a [[Demiurge]]. In [[Dharmic religion]]s [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is believed to be the illusion of a physical universe.

[[Physicalism]], a type of [[monism]], holds that only physical things exist. This is also known as [[metaphysical naturalism]].

{{Paranormal}}
The '''''preternatural''''' or '''''praeternatural''''' is that which appears outside or beside (Latin ''[[:Wikt:preter-|præter]]'') the [[nature|natural]]. It is "suspended between the mundane and the miraculous".&lt;ref&gt;Allchin, Douglas, "Monsters &amp; Marvels: How Do We Interpret the "Preternatural"?", ''The American Biology Teacher'', November 2007. p.565.&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the term is often used to distinguish marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to [[witchcraft]] or [[demon]]s, from the purely [[divinity|divine]] power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature. In the [[early modern period]] the term was used by scientists to refer to abnormalities and strange phenomena of various kinds that seemed to depart from the norms of nature.

==Theology==
Medieval theologians made a clear distinction between the natural, the preternatural and the supernatural. [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the supernatural consists in "God’s unmediated actions"; the natural is "what happens always or most of the time"; and the preternatural is "what happens rarely, but nonetheless by the agency of created beings...Marvels belong, properly speaking, to the realm of the preternatural."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Burshatin, "Elena Alias Elewno: Genders, sexualities, and 'race' in the mirror of natural history in sixteenth-century Spain" in Sabrina Petra Ramet, ''Gender Reversals and Gender Cultures: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Routledge, New York, 1996, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians, following Aquinas, argued that only God had the power to disregard the laws of nature that he has created, but that demons could manipulate the laws of nature by a form of trickery, to deceive the unwary into believing they had experienced real miracles. According to historian Lorraine Daston,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although demons, astral intelligences, and other spirits might manipulate natural causes with superhuman dexterity and thereby work marvels, as mere creatures they could never transcend from the preternatural to the supernatural and work genuine miracles.&lt;ref name = "Lor"&gt;Lorraine Daston, "Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe", Peter G. Platt, ''Wonders, Marvels, and Monsters in Early Modern Culture'', University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;76–105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 16th century, the term "preternatural" was increasingly used to refer to demonic activity comparable to the use of magic by human adepts: The Devil, "being a natural Magician … may perform many acts in ways above our knowledge, though not transcending our natural power."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; According to the philosophy of the time, preternatural phenomena were not contrary to divine law, but used hidden, or [[occult]] powers that violated the ''normal'' pattern of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt;

==Science==
With the emergence of early modern science, the concept of the preternatural increasingly came to be used to refer to strange or abnormal phenomena that seemed to violate the normal working of nature, but which were not associated with magic and witchcraft. This was a development of the idea that preternatural phenomena were fake miracles. As Daston puts it, "To simplify the historical sequence somewhat: first, preternatural phenomena were demonized and thereby incidentally naturalized; then the demons were deleted, leaving only the natural causes."&lt;ref name = "Lor"/&gt; The use of the term was especially common in medicine, for example in John Brown's ''A Compleat Treatise of Preternatural Tumours'' (1678), or [[William Smellie (obstetrician)|William Smellie]]'s ''A Collection of Preternatural Cases and Observations in Midwifery'' (1754).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel J. Rogal, ''Medicine in Great Britain from the Restoration to the Nineteenth Century, 1660–1800: An Annotated Bibliography'', Greenwood Press, New York, 1992, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the term was appropriated in anthropology to refer to folk beliefs about fairies, trolls and other such creatures which were not thought of as demonic, but which were perceived to affect the natural world in unpredictable ways. According to [[Thorstein Veblen]], such preternatural agents were often thought of as forces somewhere between supernatural beings and material processes. "The preternatural agency is not necessarily conceived to be a personal agent in the full sense, but it is an agency which partakes of the attributes of personality to the extent of somewhat arbitrarily influencing the outcome of any enterprise, and especially of any contest."&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, T., ''The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions'', Macmillan, New York, 1915, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguistic association between individual agents and unexplained or unfortunate circumstances remains. Many people attribute occurrences that are known to be material processes, such as "gremlins in the engine", a "ghost in the machine", or [[pathetic fallacy|attributing motives to objects]]: "the clouds are threatening". The anthropomorphism in our daily life is a combination of the above cultural stems, as well as the manifestation of our pattern-projecting minds.{{or|date=June 2015}}

==Scholarship==
In 2011, Penn State Press began publishing a learned journal entitled ''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural''. Edited by Kirsten Uszkalo and Richard Raiswell, the journal is dedicated to publishing articles, reviews and short editions of original texts that deal with conceptions and perceptions of the preternatural in any culture and in any historical period. The journal covers "magics, witchcraft, spiritualism, occultism, prophecy, monstrophy, demonology, and folklore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_Preternature.html |title=''Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural'' |publisher=Penn State University Press |access-date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

'''Surface conductivity''' is an additional [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of an [[electrolyte]] in the vicinity of charged surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Surface and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] correspond to the electrically driven motion of [[ions]] in an [[electric field]].&lt;/ref&gt; Close to charged surfaces a layer of [[counter ion]]s of opposite polarity exists which is attracted by the [[surface charge]]s. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] far from the charged surface and leads to a higher conductivity of this layer.

[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]] was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science" &lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model, Ref.2. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk fluid is the [[diffuse layer]]. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the [[Stern layer]].

It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity.

The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called "additional surface conductivity".&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. "Electrokinetic Phenomena", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.&lt;ref&gt;Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity κ&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=D it is given in Ref.2:

:F is the [[Faraday constant]]
:T is the [[absolute temperature]]
:R is the [[gas constant]]
:C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid
:z is the [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
:ζ is the [[electrokinetic potential]]

The parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] to the motion of ions within the DL:
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Dukhin number]] is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of [[electrokinetic phenomena]], such as, [[electrophoresis]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

==Surface Science==
'''Surface conductivity''' may refer to the electrical conduction across a solid surface measured by surface probes. Experiments may be done to test this material property as in the [[Extrinsic semiconductor|n-type]] surface conductivity of [[Extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] &lt;ref&gt; W.L. Brown. "n-Type Surface Conductivity on p-Type Germanium". Phys. Rev. 91, 518 (1953). &lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, surface conductivity is measured in coupled phenomena such as [[Photoconductivity|photoconductivity]], for example, for the metal oxide semiconductor [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]]&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shapira, S.M. Cox and David Lichtman. "CHEMISORPTION, PHOTODESORPTION AND CONDUCTIVITY
MEASUREMENTS ON ZnO SURFACES". Surface Science 54, 43 (1976). &lt;/ref&gt;. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

Further observational improvements led to the realization that our Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in a [[galaxy]] we call the [[Milky Way]], which is one of at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy [[exoplanet|have planets]].

The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[cosmology|cosmological]] description of the development of the Universe. Under this theory, space and time emerged together {{val|13.799|0.021|u=billion years}} ago&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

After an [[inflationary epoch|initial accelerated expansion]] at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, and the separation of the [[fundamental interaction|four known fundamental forces]], the Universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first [[subatomic particle]]s and simple [[atom]]s to form. [[Dark matter]] gradually gathered forming a [[foam|foam-like]] structure of [[filament (cosmology)|filaments]] and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Giant clouds of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most [[density|dense]], forming the first [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[star]]s, and everything else seen today. It is possible to see objects that are now further away than 13.799 billion [[light-year]]s because [[metric expansion of space|space itself has expanded]], and it is still expanding today. This means that objects which are now up to 46 billion light years away can [[observable universe|still be seen]] in their distant past, because in the past when their light was emitted, they were much closer to the Earth.

From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more [[matter]] than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as [[dark matter]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redd|first1=Nola|title=What is Dark Matter?|url=https://www.space.com/20930-dark-matter.html|website=Space.com|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''dark'' means that there is a wide range of strong [[indirect evidence]] that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The [[Lambda-CDM]] model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about {{val|69.2|1.2|u=%}} [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a [[scalar field]] known as [[dark energy]] which is responsible for the current [[expansion of space]], and about 25.8% [2015] is dark matter.&lt;ref name="planck_2015"&gt;[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/10/aa27101-15/T9.html Planck 2015 results, table 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary ("[[baryonic matter|baryonic]]") matter is therefore only 4.9% [2015] of the physical universe.&lt;ref name="planck_2015" /&gt; Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of ordinary matter, or about 0.3% of the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There are many competing hypotheses about the [[ultimate fate of the universe]] and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various [[multiverse]] hypotheses, in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.&lt;ref name="Brian Greene 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EllisKS032" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason.

== Etymology ==
The word ''universe'' derives from the [[Old French]] word ''univers'', which in turn derives from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 3518.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used.&lt;ref name="lewis_short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. and Short, S (1879) ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198642016}}, pp. 1933, 1977–1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synonyms ===
A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was {{lang|grc|τὸ πᾶν}}, ''tò pân'' ("the all"), defined as all matter and all space, and {{lang|grc|τὸ ὅλον}}, ''tò hólon'' ("all things"), which did not necessarily include the void.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=πᾶς | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/πᾶς}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott | title=A Greek-English Lexicon | quote=ὅλος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/ὅλος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another synonym was {{lang|grc|ὁ κόσμος}}, ''ho kósmos'' (meaning the [[world (philosophy)|world]], the [[cosmos]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=Liddell | author2=Scott |title = A Greek–English Lexicon | quote = κόσμος | url = http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/κόσμος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (''totum'', ''mundus'', ''natura'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.T. | author2=Short, S | date=1879 | title=A Latin Dictionary | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 | pages=1175, 1189–90, 1881–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ''Das All'', ''Weltall'', and ''Natur'' for ''Universe''. The same synonyms are found in English, such as everything (as in the [[theory of everything]]), the cosmos (as in [[cosmology]]), the world (as in the [[many-worlds interpretation]]), and [[nature]] (as in [[natural law]]s or [[natural philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary | volume=II | isbn= 978-0198611172 | publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press | date=1971 | pages=569, 909, 1900, 3821–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology and the Big Bang ==
{{Main|Big Bang|Chronology of the universe}}
{{Nature timeline}}
The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Silk|title=Horizons of Cosmology|publisher=Templeton Pressr|date=2009|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Singh|title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=2005|page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the Universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. A version of the model with a [[cosmological constant]] (Lambda) and [[cold dark matter]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]], is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the [[Planck epoch]], a brief period extending from time zero to one [[Planck time]] unit of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and [[gravity]] - currently the weakest by far of the [[fundamental interactions|four known forces]] - is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been [[grand unification|unified]]. Since the Planck epoch, space has been [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] to its present scale, with a very short but intense period of [[cosmic inflation]] believed to have occurred within the first [[Scientific Notation|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;]] seconds.&lt;ref name=Sivaram&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. Sivaram | journal=Astrophysics &amp; Space Science | date=1986 | volume=125 | issue=1 | pages=189–99 | doi=10.1007/BF00643984 | bibcode=1986Ap&amp;SS.125..189S | title= Evolution of the Universe through the Planck epoch}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move; instead the [[metric expansion of space|metric]] that defines space itself changed. Although objects in [[spacetime]] cannot move faster than the [[speed of light]], this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light could travel since the start of the universe.

Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence, the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of [[subatomic particles]] were able to form in short periods of time known as the [[quark epoch]], the [[hadron epoch]], and the [[lepton epoch]]. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. These [[elementary particle]]s associated stably into ever larger combinations, including stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, which then formed more complex [[atomic nuclei]] through [[nuclear fusion]]. This process, known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred. About 25% of the [[proton]]s and all the [[neutron]]s in the universe, by mass, were converted to [[helium]], with small amounts of [[deuterium]] (a [[isotope|form]] of [[hydrogen]]) and traces of [[lithium]]. Any other [[chemical element|element]] was only formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons remained unaffected, as [[hydrogen]] nuclei.

After nucleosynthesis ended, the universe entered a period known as the [[photon epoch]]. During this period, the Universe was still far too hot for matter to form neutral [[atom]]s, so it contained a hot, dense, foggy [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negatively charged [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. After about 377,000 years, the universe had cooled enough that electrons and nuclei could form the first stable [[atom]]s. This is known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] for historical reasons; in fact electrons and nuclei were combining for the first time. Unlike plasma, neutral atoms are [[Opacity (optics)|transparent]] to many [[wavelength]]s of light, so for the first time the universe also became transparent. The photons released ("[[photon decoupling|decoupled]]") when these atoms formed can still be seen today; they form the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB).

As the Universe expands, the [[energy density]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]] because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. At around 47,000 years, the [[energy density]] of matter became larger than that of photons and [[neutrino]]s, and began to dominate the large scale behavior of the universe. This marked the end of the [[radiation-dominated era]] and the start of the [[matter-dominated era]].

In the earliest stages of the universe, tiny fluctuations within the universe's density led to [[filament (cosmology)|concentrations]] of [[dark matter]] gradually forming. Ordinary matter, attracted to these by [[gravity]], formed large gas clouds and eventually, stars and galaxies, where the dark matter was most dense, and [[void (cosmology)|voids]] where it was least dense. After around 100 - 300 million years,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} the first [[star]]s formed, known as [[Population III]] stars. These were probably very massive, luminous, [[metallicity|non metallic]] and short-lived. They were responsible for the gradual [[reionization]] of the Universe between about 200-500 million years and 1 billion years, and also for seeding the universe with elements heavier than helium, through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Scientific American | title= The First Stars in the Universe |author1=Richard B.

After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present [[dark-energy-dominated era]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the expansion of the Universe is [[accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]] due to dark energy.

Of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s, [[gravitation]] is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the [[weak nuclear force|weak]] and [[strong nuclear force]]s, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The Universe appears to have much more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]], an asymmetry possibly related to the [[CP violation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 28, 2003 |url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |title=Antimatter |publisher=Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council |accessdate=August 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307075727/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Ps/bbs/bbs_antimatter.asp |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the [[Big Bang]], would have completely annihilated each other and left only [[photon]]s as a result of their interaction.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. et al. |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24048.html |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |issue=7676 |pages=371–74 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |pmid=29052625 |accessdate=26 October 2017 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universe also appears to have neither net [[momentum]] nor [[angular momentum]], which follows accepted physical laws if the Universe is finite.

=== Size and regions ===
{{See also|Observable universe|Observational cosmology}}
The size of the Universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of [[space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing [[expansion of space]]. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.&lt;ref name="Kaku2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&amp;pg=PA202|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0385525442|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the [[observable universe]]. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.&lt;!-- [[Hubble's law]] links to this section --&gt;

=== Age and expansion ===
{{Main|Age of the universe|Metric expansion of space}}
Astronomers calculate the [[age of the Universe]] by assuming that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (satellite)|Planck]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for [[Type Ia supernovae]], and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Assuming that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 [[Measurement uncertainty|±]] 0.021 billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;

Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey.

The more matter there is in the Universe, the stronger the mutual [[gravitational]] pull of the matter. If the Universe were ''too'' dense then it would re-collapse into a [[gravitational singularity]]. However, if the Universe contained too ''little'' matter then the self-gravity would be too weak for astronomical structures, like galaxies or planets, to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded [[monotonic]]ally. [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|Perhaps unsurprisingly]], our universe has [[Critical Mass Density of the Universe|just the right mass-energy density]], equivalent to about 5 protons per cubic meter, which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | author=[[Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll]] and [[Michio Kaku]] | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | date=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the expansion rate would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe; and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the [[deceleration parameter]], which most cosmologists expected to be positive and related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be negative, approximately -0.55, which technically implies that the second derivative of the cosmic [[scale factor cosmology|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a}&lt;/math&gt; has been positive in the last 5-6 billion years.&lt;ref name="nobel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acceleration does not, however, imply that the Hubble parameter is currently increasing; see [[deceleration parameter]] for details.

=== Spacetime ===
{{Main|Spacetime|World line}}
{{See also|Lorentz transformation}}
Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are [[event (relativity)|events]]. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time. A spacetime is the union of all events (in the same way that a line is the union of all of its points), formally organized into a [[manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three [[space|spatial]] [[dimension]]s and one temporal ([[time]]) dimension (an event in the spacetime of the physical Universe can therefore be identified by a set of four coordinates: {{nowrap begin}}(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t''){{nowrap end}} ). On the average, [[3-space|space]] is observed to be very nearly [[Shape of the universe|flat]] (with a [[curvature]] close to zero), meaning that [[Euclidean geometry]] is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most of the Universe.&lt;ref name="Shape"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_content.html WMAP Mission: Results&amp;nbsp;– Age of the Universe].

Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Spacetime also appears to have a [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[topology]], in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions (which is postulated by theories such as the [[String theory]]) and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or [[toroid]]al topologies of two-dimensional [[space]]s.&lt;ref name="Nat03"&gt;{{cite journal

The spacetime of the Universe is usually interpreted from a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] perspective, with space as consisting of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]], and time as consisting of [[one dimension]], the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10714-006-0254-9 | bibcode=2006GReGr..38..643B | arxiv=gr-qc/0407022 | title=Spacetime and Euclidean geometry | journal= General Relativity and Gravitation | volume=38 | issue=4 | year=2006 | pages=643–51 | last1=Brill | first1=Dieter | last2=Jacobsen | first2=Ted| citeseerx=10.1.1.338.7953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining space and time into a single [[manifold]] called [[Minkowski space]], physicists have simplified a large number of [[Theoretical physics|physical theories]], as well as described in a more uniform way the workings of the Universe at both the [[Physical cosmology|supergalactic]] and [[quantum mechanics|subatomic]] levels.

Spacetime [[event (relativity)|events]] are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but rather are known to be relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity.

=== Shape ===
{{Main|Shape of the universe}}
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|250px|The three possible options for the shape of the Universe]]

General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the Universe includes both [[Shape of the universe#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local geometry]] in the [[observable universe]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|global geometry]].
Cosmologists often work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[Comoving distance|comoving coordinates]]. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward [[light cone]], which delimits the [[cosmological horizon]].
The cosmological horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the maximum distance from which [[Elementary particle|particles]] can have traveled to the [[observation|observer]] in the [[age of the Universe]]. This horizon represents the boundary between the observable and the unobservable regions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robert Harrison|title=Cosmology: the science of the universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNxeHD2cbLYC&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521661485|pages=447–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew R.

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the Universe theory is the [[density parameter]], Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.&lt;ref name=FateOfTheUniverse&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe?|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations, including the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE), [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP), and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] maps of the CMB, suggest that the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) models.&lt;ref name="nasa_popular_uni_curv"&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html Will the Universe expand forever?], WMAP website at NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RBSG08"&gt;{{cite journal|last =Roukema|first =Boudewijn|author2=Zbigniew Buliński |author3=Agnieszka Szaniewska |author4=Nicolas E.

The Universe may be ''fine-tuned''; the Fine-tuned Universe hypothesis is the proposition that the conditions that allow the existence of observable [[life]] in the Universe can only occur when certain universal [[physical constant|fundamental physical constants]] lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would have been unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name=toa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CI/CI301.html |title=CI301: The Anthropic Principle |accessdate=October 31, 2007 |author=Mark Isaak (ed.) |date=2005 |work=Index to Creationist Claims |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition is discussed among [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[science|scientists]], [[theology|theologians]], and proponents of [[creationism]].

Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to [[vacuum energy]]. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.

=== Dark matter ===
{{main|Dark matter}}
Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of [[matter]] that is invisible to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but which accounts for most of the matter in the Universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] of the Universe. Other than [[neutrinos]], a form of [[hot dark matter]], dark matter has not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in modern [[astrophysics]]. Dark matter neither [[blackbody spectrum|emits]] nor absorbs light or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]] at any significant level. Dark matter is estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass–energy and 84.5% &lt;!--26.8/(4.9 + 26.8)--&gt; of the total matter in the Universe.&lt;ref name = DarkMatter&gt;Sean Carroll, Ph.D., Caltech, 2007, The Teaching Company, ''Dark Matter, Dark Energy: The Dark Side of the Universe'', Guidebook Part 2 p. 46, Accessed October 7, 2013, "...dark matter: An invisible, essentially collisionless component of matter that makes up about 25 percent of the energy density of the universe... it's a different kind of particle... something not yet observed in the laboratory..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=planckcam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/planck-captures-portrait-of-the-young-universe-revealing-earliest-light |title=Planck captures portrait of the young Universe, revealing earliest light |date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ordinary Matter ===
{{main|Matter}}
The remaining 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter, that is, [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s and the objects they form. This matter includes [[star]]s, which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies, as well as interstellar gas in the [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] and [[intergalactic medium|intergalactic]] media, [[planet]]s, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into, touch or squeeze.&lt;ref name=Davies2&gt;

Ordinary matter commonly exists in four [[state of matter|states]] (or [[phase (matter)|phases]]): [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. However, advances in experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s and [[fermionic condensate]]s.

Ordinary matter is composed of two types of [[elementary particle]]s: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s.&lt;ref name=Hooft&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the proton is formed of two [[up quarks]] and one [[down quark]]; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an [[atomic nucleus]], made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which is made up of [[baryons]], astronomers often use the term ''baryonic matter'' to describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic matter" is electrons.

Soon after the [[Big Bang]], primordial protons and neutrons formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] of the early Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]], but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, [[carbon]], was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of [[metallicity|heavier elements]] resulted from [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Clayton1983&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Donald D.|title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis|date=1983|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226109534|pages=362–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Hadron}}
A hadron is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s [[bound state|held together]] by the [[strong force]]. Hadrons are categorized into two families: [[baryon]]s (such as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) made of three quarks, and [[meson]]s (such as [[pion]]s) made of one quark and one [[antiparticle|antiquark]]. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.
From approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], during a period is known as the [[hadron epoch]], the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the mass of the Universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and antimatter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in particle-antiparticle [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.&lt;ref name=Allday2002&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allday|first1=Jonathan|title=Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang|date=2002|publisher=IOP Publishing|isbn=978-0750308069|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

==== Leptons ====
{{main|Lepton}}
A lepton is an [[elementary particle|elementary]], [[half-integer spin]] particle that does not undergo strong interactions but is subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classes of leptons exist: [[electric charge|charged]] leptons (also known as the ''electron-like'' leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as [[neutrino]]s). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas [[muon]]s and [[tau (particle)|taus]] are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in [[high energy physics|high energy]] collisions, such as those involving [[cosmic ray]]s or carried out in [[particle accelerator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various [[composite particle]]s such as [[atom]]s and [[positronium]]. The [[electron]] governs nearly all of [[chemistry]], as it is found in [[atom]]s and is directly tied to all [[chemical property|chemical properties]]. Neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe but rarely interact with normal matter.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[lepton epoch]] was the period in the evolution of the early Universe in which the [[lepton]]s dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the [[Big Bang]], after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other at the end of the [[hadron epoch]]. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thermal history of the Universe and early growth of density fluctuations|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~gamk/TUM_Lectures/Lecture4.pdf|work=Guinevere Kauffmann|publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons.

==== Photons ====
{{Main|Photon epoch}}
{{See also|Photino}}
A photon is the [[quantum]] of [[light]] and all other forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is the [[force carrier]] for the [[electromagnetic force]], even when [[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange|static]] via [[virtual photons]]. The effects of this [[force]] are easily observable at the [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and at the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] level because the photon has zero [[rest mass]]; this allows long distance [[fundamental interaction|interactions]]. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best explained by [[quantum mechanics]] and exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], exhibiting properties of [[wave]]s and of [[wikt:particle|particles]].

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were [[annihilation|annihilated]] at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the Universe contained a hot dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer interacted frequently with matter and the Universe became transparent. The highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent [[structure formation]] took place.&lt;ref name=Allday2002/&gt;{{rp|244–66}}

== Cosmological models ==
=== Model of the Universe based on general relativity ===
{{main|Solutions of the Einstein field equations}}
{{See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the Universe}}
[[General relativity]] is the [[Differential geometry|geometric]] [[Theoretical physics|theory]] of [[gravitation]] published by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in [[modern physics]]. It is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes [[special relativity]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[Time in physics|time]], or spacetime. In particular, the [[curvature]] of spacetime is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the [[acceleration]] of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt;

With the assumption of the [[cosmological principle]] that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field equations that describes the Universe is the [[metric tensor]] called the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]],
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a [[spherical coordinate system]]. This [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] has only two undetermined parameters. An overall [[dimensionless]] length [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''R'' describes the size scale of the Universe as a function of time; an increase in ''R'' is the [[expansion of the Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A curvature index ''k'' describes the geometry. The index ''k'' is defined so that it can take only one of three values: 0, corresponding to flat [[Euclidean geometry]]; 1, corresponding to a space of positive [[curvature]]; or −1, corresponding to a space of positive or negative curvature.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66" /&gt; The value of ''R'' as a function of time ''t'' depends upon ''k'' and the [[cosmological constant]] ''Λ''.&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |last1=Zeilik |first1=Michael |last2=Gregory |first2=Stephen A. |date=1998 |edition=4th |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0030062285 | section=25-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cosmological constant represents the energy density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the [[Friedmann equation]] after its inventor, [[Alexander Friedmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|date = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–86|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|authorlink = Alexander Friedmann|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/16735/E001554876.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the Universe can remain constant ''only'' if the Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change over time. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; and never moved faster than the [[speed of light]].

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a [[gravitational singularity]] in the past, when ''R'' went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the [[Big Bang]] model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a [[quantum theory of gravity]], which has not yet been formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=122–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of spacetime&lt;ref name="RaineThomas66"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion [[light year]]s). If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the Universe has a finite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70" /&gt; A Universe with positive curvature is often visualized as a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere]] embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the Universe has an infinite volume.&lt;ref name="RaineThomas70"&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a [[torus]] is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with [[periodic boundary conditions]].

The [[ultimate fate of the Universe]] is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a [[Big Crunch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly starting a new Universe in a [[Big Bounce]]. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, ''k'' would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the [[Future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]] and the [[heat death of the Universe]].&lt;ref name="zeilik_cosmology" /&gt; Modern data suggests that the rate of expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a [[Big Rip]]. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (''k'' = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raine|Thomas|2001|pp=88, 110–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Eternal inflation}}
Some speculative theories have proposed that our Universe is but one of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]], challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.&lt;ref name="EllisKS032"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Munitz MK|date = 1959|title = One Universe or Many?|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume = 12|pages = 231–55|doi = 10.2307/2707516|issue = 2|jstor = 2707516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as [[plane (esotericism)|alternate planes of consciousness]] and [[simulated reality]].

[[Max Tegmark]] developed a four-part [[Multiverse#Max Tegmark's four levels|classification scheme]] for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in response to various [[Physics]] problems. An example of such multiverses is the one resulting from the [[bubble universe theory|chaotic inflation]] model of the early universe.&lt;ref name="chaotic_inflation"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Linde A.|date = 1986|title = Eternal chaotic inflation|journal = Mod.

In this interpretation, parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to [[quantum superposition]] and [[decoherence]], with all states of the [[wave function]]s being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, in the many-worlds interpretation the multiverse evolves as a [[universal wavefunction]]. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.&lt;ref name=everett1957&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Everett | first1 = Hugh | authorlink = Hugh Everett | year = 1957 | title = Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 454–62 |bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..454E |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.29.454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is [[Multiverse#Level I: An extension of our Universe|Level I]]. The multiverses of this level are composed by distant spacetime events "in our own universe". If space is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the history of Earth's entire [[Hubble volume]] occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculated that our nearest so-called [[doppelgänger]], is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; meters away from us (a [[double exponential function]] larger than a [[googolplex]]).&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12701329|title=Parallel universes.

Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies).

The modern era of cosmology began with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole.

=== Mythologies ===
{{Main|Creation myth|Creator deity|Religious cosmology}}
Many cultures have [[List of creation myths|stories describing the origin of the world and universe]]. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some [[truth]]. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the Universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | quote="In common usage the word 'myth' refers to narratives or beliefs that are untrue or merely fanciful; the stories that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible.

In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]] concept of [[Adi-Buddha]], the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth), the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] goddess [[Coatlicue]] myth, the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Ennead|god]] [[Atum]] story, and the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Genesis creation narrative]] in which the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]] created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the [[Maori mythology|Maori story]] of [[Rangi and Papa]]. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god&amp;nbsp;— as from [[Tiamat]] in the [[Babylon]]ian epic ''[[Enuma Elish]]'' or from the giant [[Ymir]] in [[Norse mythology]]&amp;nbsp;– or from chaotic materials, as in [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as [[Brahman]] and [[Prakrti]], the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]] of the [[Serer people|Serers]],&lt;ref&gt;([[Henry Gravrand]], "La civilisation Sereer -Pangool") [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43–44", F.

=== Philosophical models ===
{{Further|Cosmology}}
{{See also|Pre-Socratic philosophy|Physics (Aristotle)|Hindu cosmology|Islamic cosmology|Philosophy of space and time}}
The [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Universe|page=21|publisher=Oxford University Press|first=Louise|last=B. Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or ''[[arche]]''. The first to do so was [[Thales]], who proposed this material to be [[Water (classical element)|water]]. Thales' student, [[Anaximander]], proposed that everything came from the limitless ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] proposed the primordial material to be [[Air (classical element)|air]] on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the ''arche'' to condense or dissociate into different forms. [[Anaxagoras]] proposed the principle of ''[[Nous]]'' (Mind), while [[Heraclitus]] proposed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (and spoke of ''[[logos]]''). [[Empedocles]] proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] believed that all things were composed of [[number]], with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the [[Platonic solids]]. [[Democritus]], and later philosophers—most notably [[Leucippus]]—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible [[atom]]s moving through a [[void (astronomy)|void]] ([[vacuum]]), although [[Aristotle]] did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers [[Drag (physics)|resistance to motion]]. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary [[Parmenides]] made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν}} (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student [[Zeno of Elea]] challenged them with several famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] school, developed a notion of [[atomism]] and proposed that [[light]] and [[heat]] were varieties of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''Our Oriental Heritage'': {{quote|"Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the Sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD, the [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomist]] philosopher [[Dignāga]] proposed [[atom]]s to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York: {{quote|"The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is evanescent",... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called "qualities" (''guna-dharma'') in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called ''guna'', "quality", but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called ''dharmas'' ('qualities')."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of [[temporal finitism]] was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel).&lt;ref name=Viney1985&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles Hartshorne and the Existence of God|chapter=The Cosmological Argument|author=Donald Wayne Viney|pages=65–68|year=1985|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0873959070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Astronomical concepts ===
{{Main|History of astronomy|Timeline of astronomy}}
[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus's]] 3rd century BCE calculations on the relative sizes of, from left to right, the Sun, Earth, and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy.]]

Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after [[astronomy]] began with the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]], who viewed the Universe as a [[Flat Earth|flat disk]] floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

Later [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on [[empirical evidence]]. The first coherent model was proposed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidos]]. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, [[celestial spheres]] eternally [[uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion]] around a stationary Earth. Normal [[classical elements|matter]] is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

''[[De Mundo]]'' (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely, earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole Universe".&lt;ref name=1908DeMundo&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich|title=De Mundo|year=1914|author=Aristotle; Forster, E. S. (Edward Seymour), 1879–1950; Dobson, J. F. (John Frederic), 1875–1947|page=2|publisher=Oxford : The Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model was also refined by [[Callippus]] and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by [[Ptolemy]]. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the [[Fourier series|Fourier modes]]). Other Greek scientists, such as the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]], postulated (according to [[Stobaeus]] account) that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Planet]]s revolved in uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. (1968) [https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics ''A History of Mathematics'']. Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the Universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in [[Archimedes]]' book ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why [[stellar parallax]] had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from [[Plutarch]] suggests (''On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cleanthes]] [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the [[Stoics]]] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a [[Hellenistic astronomer]] who lived a century after Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Otto E.

Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of [[tide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|8807103494}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987|loc=p. 527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a [[Geometry|geometric]] model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] later did in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987| loc=pp. 527–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] models were also proposed by the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] [[Aryabhata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 529–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomers]] [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Albumasar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartel|1987 | loc=pp. 534–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Sijzi]].&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nasr |first=Seyyed H. |authorlink=Hossein Nasr |origyear=1964 |date=1993 |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |edition=2nd |publisher=1st edition by [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition by [[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=978-0791415153 |pages=135–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|thumb|left|[[Copernican heliocentrism|Model of the Copernican Universe]] by [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576, with the amendment that the stars are no longer confined to a sphere, but spread uniformly throughout the space surrounding the [[planet]]s.]]

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the [[Western world]] for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the [[Earth]] rotated on its axis and if the [[Sun]] were placed at the center of the Universe.

{{quote|In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time?|Nicolaus Copernicus| in Chapter 10, Book 1 of ''De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum'' (1543)}}

As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] is very old, dating at least to [[Philolaus]] (c. 450 BC), [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (c. 350 BC) and [[Ecphantus the Pythagorean]]. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, ''On Learned Ignorance'' (1440).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Misner|Misner, Thorne and Wheeler]], p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sijzi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Science in the Quran|volume=1|publisher=Malik Library|first=Ema Ākabara|last=Ālī|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. [[Empirical research|Empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of [[comet]]s, was given by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] (1201–1274) and [[Ali Qushji]] (1403–1474).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ragep |first=F.

In 1919, when [[Hooker Telescope]] was completed, the prevailing view still was that the Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, [[Edwin Hubble]] identified [[Cepheid variable]]s in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved conclusively that [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Nebula|Triangulum]] among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe consists of multitude of galaxies.&lt;ref name="SharovNovikov1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharov|first1=Aleksandr Sergeevich|last2=Novikov|first2=Igor Dmitrievich|title=Edwin Hubble, the discoverer of the big bang universe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEwkEdPc70C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=December 31, 2011|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521416177|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling.

All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship."

"Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

 --&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |phenomena}}

A '''wormhole''' (or '''Einstein–Rosen bridge''') is a speculative structure linking separate points in [[spacetime]], and is based on a [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of the Einstein field equations]]. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations or different points of time). More precisely it is a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the [[Calabi–Yau]] manifold manifesting itself in [[Anti-de Sitter space]]. 

Wormholes are consistent with the [[general theory of relativity]], but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen.

A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion [[light year]]s or more, short distances such as a few [[meter]]s, different [[multiverse|universes]], or different points in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2|pages=|via=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization ==
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|Wormhole visualized]]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, [[space]] can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] tube (the inside surface of a [[cylinder]]), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a [[2D plane]], the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in [[3D space]].

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the [[Spacetime|spacetime continuum]], and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.


== Terminology ==
In 1928, [[Hermann Weyl]] proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of [[electromagnetic field]] energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weyl | first1 = H. | title = Feld und Materie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19213701405 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 65 | issue = 14| year = 1921 | pages=541–563| bibcode = 1921AnP...370..541W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Erhard  (ed.), ''Hermann Weyl's Raum - Zeit - Materie and a General Introduction to His Scientific Work'', 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not use the term "wormhole" (he spoke of "one-dimensional tubes" instead).&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/ "Hermann Weyl"]: entry in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[theoretical physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler]] (inspired by Weyl's work)&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; coined the term "wormhole" in a 1957 paper co-authored by [[Charles Misner]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misner | first1 = C. W. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = J. A. | title = Classical physics as geometry | doi = 10.1016/0003-4916(57)90049-0 | journal = Ann. Phys. | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | page = 525| year = 1957 | bibcode = 1957AnPhy...2..525M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This analysis forces one to consider situations... where there is a net flux of lines of force, through what [[topologist]]s would call "a [[Handle decomposition|handle]]" of the multiply-connected space, and what physicists might perhaps be excused for more vividly terming a "wormhole".|Charles Misner and John Wheeler in ''[[Annals of Physics]]''}}

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both [[Geometry and topology|''geometrically'' and ''topologically'']].{{elucidate|are these definitions equivalent?|date=March 2017}} From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a [[Compact space|compact]] region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not [[simply connected]]. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from [[Matt Visser]]'s ''Lorentzian Wormholes'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Visser1996" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

{{quote|If a [[Minkowski space]]time contains a compact region Ω, and if the topology of Ω is of the form Ω ~ R × Σ, where Σ is a three-manifold of the nontrivial topology, whose boundary has topology of the form ∂Σ ~ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if, furthermore, the [[hypersurface]]s Σ are all spacelike, then the region Ω contains a quasipermanent intrauniverse wormhole.}}

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo's ''The Physics of Stargates, ''a wormhole is defined informally as: {{quote|a region of spacetime containing a "[[world tube]]" (the time evolution of a closed surface) that cannot be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a [[world line]] (the time evolution of a point).}}

The equations of the theory of [[general relativity]] have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the ''Schwarzschild wormhole''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Dobrev&gt;Vladimir Dobrev (ed.), ''Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics: Varna, Bulgaria, June 2015'', Springer, 2016, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; which would be present in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an ''eternal black hole'', but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]], would only be possible if [[exotic matter]] with negative [[energy density]] could be used to stabilize them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:FY221c15.png|thumb|An artist's impression of a wormhole from an observer's perspective, crossing the [[event horizon]] of a Schwarzschild wormhole that bridges two different universes. The observer originates from the right, and another universe becomes visible in the center of the wormhole's shadow once the horizon is crossed, the observer seeing light that has fallen into the [[black hole]] interior region from the other universe; however, this other universe is unreachable in the case of a Schwarzschild wormhole, as the bridge always collapses before the observer has time to cross it, and everything that has fallen through the event horizon of either universe is inevitably crushed in the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]].]]

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as ''Einstein–Rosen bridges''&lt;ref name=Dobrev/&gt; (named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]),&lt;ref name=ER/&gt; are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as [[vacuum solution]]s to the [[Einstein field equations]], and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates#The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution|maximally extended]] version of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, "maximally extended" refers to the idea that the [[spacetime]] should not have any "edges": it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle's future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a [[geodesic]] in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the [[event horizon]] from the outside, there must be a separate [[white hole]] interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up ''away'' from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with [[coordinate system]]s such that if a [[hypersurface]] of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a [[space-like]] separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') is picked and an "embedding diagram" drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an "Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/collapse.html#kruskal |title=Collapse to a Black Hole |publisher=Casa.colorado.edu |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge was discovered by [[Ludwig Flamm]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flamm|title=Beiträge zur Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie|date=1916|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=XVII|page=448}} ("Comments on Einstein's Theory of Gravity")&lt;/ref&gt; a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;A. Einstein and N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''48'''(73) (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="focus032505"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindley|first1=David|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|url=http://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|website=Physics|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=Mar 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1962, [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Fuller and J. A. Wheeler, "Causality and Multiply-Connected Space-Time," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''128'''(919) (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; showing that this type of wormhole is unstable if it connects two parts of the same universe, and that it will pinch off too quickly for light (or any particle moving slower than light) that falls in from one exterior region to make it to the other exterior region.

According to general relativity, the [[gravitational collapse]] of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the [[affine connection]] and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity.{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, Nikodem J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=Phys.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired [[Kip Thorne]] to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with [[exotic matter]] (material that has negative mass/energy).

Other non-traversable wormholes include ''Lorentzian wormholes'' (first proposed by John Archibald Wheeler in 1957), wormholes creating a [[spacetime foam]] in a general relativistic spacetime manifold depicted by a [[Lorentzian manifold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.

Ellis thoroughly analyzed the topology and the [[geodesic]]s of the [[Ellis drainhole]], showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions.  The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the [[Ricci tensor]] with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive).  (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)  The solution depends on two parameters: &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections.  When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes.  What is left is the [[Ellis wormhole]], a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.
[[Kip Thorne]] and his graduate student [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], unaware of the 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov,  manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole for use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of [[exotic matter]], was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a ''Morris–Thorne wormhole''. Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by [[Matt Visser]], in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure [[Gauss–Bonnet gravity]] (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of [[brane cosmology]]) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elias Gravanis|author2=Steven Willison|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.084025|year=2007|title='Mass without mass' from thin shells in Gauss-Bonnet gravity|issue=8|pages=084025|volume=75|journal=Phys.

Cramer|Cramer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="naturalwormholes"/&gt; in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow [[time travel|travel in time]], as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths.&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|date=1988|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=13|pages=1446–1449|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf|pmid=10038800|bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{Rp|504}}

== Raychaudhuri's theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why [[exotic matter]] is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The [[congruence (general relativity)|expansion]] goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical [[Raychaudhuri's theorem]], this requires a violation of the [[averaged null energy condition]]. Quantum effects such as the [[Casimir effect]] cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fewster|first=Christopher J.|author2=Ken D.

==Modified general relativity==
In some hypotheses where [[Alternatives to general relativity|general relativity is modified]], it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R^2 gravity, a form of [[f(R) gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1506.00988|title=Exotica ex nihilo: Traversable wormholes &amp; non-singular black holes from the vacuum of quadratic gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=4|pages=043516|last1=Duplessis|first1=Francis|last2= Easson|first2=Damien A.|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043516|bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d3516D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faster-than-light travel ==
{{further|Faster-than-light}}
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|alt=Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA Digital art by Les Bossinas (Cortez III Service Corp.), 1998|thumb|Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for [[NASA]]]]

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal ([[faster-than-light]]) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them ''outside'' the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space ''outside'' the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would of course beat the traveler.

== Time travel ==
{{main|Time travel}}

If [[#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] exist, they could allow [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="time travel"/&gt; A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher = W. W. Norton | year= 1994 | isbn = 978-0-393-31276-8| title-link = Black Holes and Time Warps }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the "younger" end would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{rp|503}} It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0503097|title=Wormholes and Time Travel?

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,&lt;ref name="Visser1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Visser | first = Matt | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Lorentzian Wormholes | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56396-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name="casimir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html |title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics |website=Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G. |authorlink=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other,&lt;ref name="visser_1"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 47 | year = 1993 | issue = 2 | pages = 554–565 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554| arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47..554V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0204022|title=The quantum physics of chronology protection|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.&lt;ref name="visser_2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 55 | year = 1997 | issue = 8 | pages = 5212–5214 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212| arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.5212V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interuniversal travel&lt;!--'Interuniversal travel', 'Inter-universal travel' and 'Everett phone' redirect here--&gt; ==
A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

In 1991 [[David Deutsch]] showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called [[density matrix]] can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David |title=Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines|date=1991|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=44|issue=10|page=3197|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brun|display-authors=etal |title=Localized Closed Timelike Curves Can Perfectly Distinguish Quantum States|date=2009|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=102|issue=21|page=210402|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.210402|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102u0402B|pmid=19519086|arxiv=0811.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pati |author2=Chakrabarty|author3=Agrawal|title=Purification of mixed states with closed timelike curve is not possible|date=2011|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=84|issue=6|page=062325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.84.062325|bibcode = 2011PhRvA..84f2325P |arxiv = 1003.4221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodrigo|first=Enrico|title=The Physics of Stargates|publisher=Eridanus Press|date= 2010|page=281|isbn= 978-0-9841500-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a wormhole time-machine introduces a type of nonlinearity into quantum theory, this sort of communication between parallel universes is consistent with [[Joseph Polchinski]]'s proposal of an '''Everett phone'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polchinski|first=Joseph |title=Weinberg's Nonlinear quantum Mechanics and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=66|issue=4|pages=397–400 |date=1991 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..66..397P|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.397 |pmid=10043797}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]) in [[Steven Weinberg]]'s formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Rodrigo, ''The Physics of Stargates: Parallel Universes, Time Travel, and the Enigma of Wormhole Physics'', Eridanus Press, 2010, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed '''interuniversal travel'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Walker, [https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23331111-100-14-interuniversal-travel-i-wouldnt-start-from-here/ "Inter-universal travel: I wouldn't start from here], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (1 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
Theories of ''wormhole metrics'' describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raine |first1=Derek |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin |date=2009 |title= Black Holes: An Introduction |publisher=Imperial College Press |page=143 |isbn=978-1-84816-383-6 | edition=2nd|doi=10.1142/p637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 dt^2 + dl^2 + (k^2 + l^2)(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2),&lt;/math&gt;

first presented by Ellis (see [[Ellis wormhole]]) as a special case of the [[Ellis drainhole]].

One type of non-traversable wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]] (see the first diagram):

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} + r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=73–77|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPpRqxY8Uw|title=Leonard Susskind {{!}} 'ER = EPR' or 'What's Behind the Horizons of Black Holes?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2m}{r}} dr^2 - r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (1 - \frac{2m}{r})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; = proper time, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = 1)

If one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to
&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r - 2m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -4(u^2 + 2m)du^2 - (u^2 + 2m)^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + \frac{u^2}{u^2 + 2m} dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0, \phi_{4} = \frac{\epsilon}{4},&lt;/math&gt;

(1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2}) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = electrical charge)

The field equations without denominators in the case when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\mu \nu} = \phi_{\mu,\nu} - \phi_{\nu,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \phi_{\mu\nu;\sigma}g^{\nu\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 (R_{ik} + \phi_{i\alpha}\phi_{k}^{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{ik} \phi_{\alpha\beta}\phi^{ab}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r^2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ylem''' is a term that was used by [[George Gamow]], his student [[Ralph Alpher]], and their associates in the late 1940s for a hypothetical original substance or condensed state of matter, which became [[subatomic particles]] and [[chemical element|element]]s as we understand them today. The term ''ylem'' was actually resuscitated (it appears in [[Webster's Second]] "the first substance from which the elements were supposed to have been formed") by Ralph Alpher.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern understanding, the "ylem" described as by Gamow was the primordial [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], formed in [[baryogenesis]], which underwent [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and was opaque to radiation. [[Recombination (cosmology)|Recombination]] of the charged plasma into neutral [[atom]]s made the Universe transparent at the age of 380,000 years, and the radiation released is still observable as [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].

==History==
It comes from an obsolete [[Middle English]] philosophical word that Alpher said he found in Webster's dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED |term=ylem |id=/231917 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word means something along the lines of "primordial substance from which all matter is formed" (that in ancient [[mythology]] of many different cultures was called the [[cosmic egg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=Jeremy |title=Out of My Mind: The Birth of Modern Cosmology |journal=The American Scholar |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=7–18 |jstor=41211280}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ultimately derives from the Greek ''ὕλη'' (''hūlē, hȳlē''), "matter", probably through an accusative singular form in Latin ''hylen, hylem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED |term=hyle |id=90173 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an oral history interview in 1968 Gamow talked about ylem as an old Hebrew word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Gamow |first=George |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4325 |title=Oral Histories - George Gamow |interviewer=Charles Weiner |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=25 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ylem is what Gamow and colleagues presumed to exist immediately after the Big Bang. Within the ylem, there were assumed to be a large number of high-energy [[photon]]s present. Alpher and [[Robert Herman]] made a [[scientific prediction]] in 1948 that we should still be able to observe these [[red-shift]]ed photons today as an ambient [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) pervading all space with a temperature of about 5 [[kelvin]]s&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos'' – ''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York: 1988 Time-Life Books, Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt; (when the CMBR was actually first detected in 1965, its temperature was found to be 3 kelvins). It is now recognized that the CMBR originated at the transition from predominantly ionized hydrogen to non-ionized hydrogen at around 400,000 years after the Big Bang.

==In popular culture ==
After the term ''ylem'' was resuscitated by Alpher, it was used in the 1952 [[science fiction]] novel ''Jack of Eagles'' by [[James Blish]]. It was also used by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] in his 1959 short story "Round Trip", reprinted in the collection ''[[Not Before Time]]''. [[Keith Laumer]] in the novel ''Dinosaur Beach'' introduces the ylem field 1969.  The term is also used by British author [[Richard Calder (writer)|Richard Calder]] in the 1990s to describe the [[quantum mechanical]] state of the "quantum magic" in the girls/robots in his "Dead" trilogy (''[[Dead Girls]]'', ''[[Dead Boys (novel)|Dead Boys]]'', ''Dead Things''). [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]] used the term in his debut novel ''[[The Golden Age (John C. Wright novel)#Book 1: The Golden Age|The Golden Age]]'' to describe a "pseudo-matter" that forms "temporary virtual particles". A German black metal band "Dark Fortress" also released an album titled "Ylem". A the trance classic by The Thrillseekers - Synaesthesia has a "Ylem" remix. The video game series [[Ultima (series)|Ultima]] uses "Ylem" as a Word of Power in its incantation and runic based spell casting system, its meaning being "matter".

In 1981, Trudy Myrrh Reagan formed an organization, "Ylem: Artists Using Science and Technology" (later written YLEM), in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ylem.org/Membership/history_detailed.html|title=YLEM Detailed history|website=www.ylem.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a usable word in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, Fifth edition.
