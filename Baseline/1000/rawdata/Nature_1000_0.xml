[[File:Kaskaskia Island 1993 flooding.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] during the [[Great Flood of 1993]].]]
A '''one-hundred-year flood''' is a [[flood]] event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes, R.R., Jr., and Dinicola, K. (2010) ''100-Year flood–it's all about chance '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/ U.S. Geological Survey General Information Product 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.   Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood [[water]] level can be mapped as an area of inundation.  The resulting [[floodplain]] map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain.  Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;Ries, K.G., and others (2008) ''StreamStats: A water resources web application '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3067/ U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2008-3067]  [http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/ Application home page] URL accessed 2015-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Environment Agency]] publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|title=Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea)|access-date=25 August 2016|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916225532/http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of [[tide]], [[storm surge]], and [[wind wave|waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Flooding|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|website=FloodSmart|publisher=National Flood Insurance Program|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=NFIP coastal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052549/https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|archive-date=2016-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and [[flood insurance]].

==Probability==
A common misunderstanding is that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period.  In fact, there is approximately a 63.4% chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period. On the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations  '' [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7] URL accessed 2015-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed, using the [[binomial distribution]], as

&lt;math&gt;P_{e}=1-\left[ 1-\left( \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where  '''T''' is the threshold [[return period]] (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, 25-yr, and so forth), and '''n''' is the number of years in the period. The [[probability of exceedance]] '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also described as the natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure.&lt;ref name="Mays"&gt;Mays, L.W (2005) ''Water Resources Engineering, chapter 10, Probability, risk, and uncertainty analysis for hydrologic and hydraulic design'' Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maidment"&gt;Maidment, D.R. ed.(1993) ''Handbook of Hydrology, chapter 18, Frequency analysis of extreme events''  New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[expected value]] of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1.

Ten-year floods have a 10% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.10); 500-year have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.002); etc. The percent chance of an X-year flood occurring in a single year is 100/X. A similar analysis is commonly applied to [[coastal flood]]ing or rainfall data. The [[return period|recurrence interval]] of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood, because of rainfall timing and location variations among different [[drainage basin]]s.

The field of [[extreme value theory]] was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering.  This theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river. In desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes, this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time (24-hours, 6-hours, or 3-hours). The extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year. So, between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm, whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event, while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis (even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right).

==Statistical assumptions==

There are a number of [[Statistical assumption|assumptions]] which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood. First, the extreme events observed in each year must be [[statistical independence|independent]] from year-to-year. In other words, the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be [[Statistical significance|significantly]] [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the observed flow rate in 1985.  1985 cannot be correlated with 1986, and so forth. The second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same [[probability distribution function]]. The third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm (rainfall or river flow rate measurement) that occurs in any one year. The fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary, meaning that the [[mean]] (average), [[standard deviation]] and [[Minima and maxima (introduction)|max/min]] values are not increasing or decreasing over time.  This concept is referred to as [[Stationary process|stationarity]].&lt;ref name="Maidment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B17C"&gt;{{cite book |last1=England |first1=John |last2=and seven others |title=Guidelines for determining flood flow frequency—Bulletin 17C |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis. The second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt; (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of [[climate change]] strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/573.full |work=Science Magazine |title=Stationarity is Dead |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult.&lt;ref name=IPPC&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2012) ''Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation,'' [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf Summary for policymakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719211442/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-07-19 }}  Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 19 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.

==Probability uncertainty==

When these assumptions are violated there is an ''unknown'' amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity, or flood depth. When all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval. For example, one might say there is a 95% chance that the 100-year flood is greater than X, but less than Y.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Direct statistical analysis&lt;ref name="B17C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACWI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulletin 17C |url=https://acwi.gov/hydrology/Frequency/b17c/ |publisher=Advisory Committee on Water Information |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11.&lt;ref name="NWIS"&gt;[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis ''National Water Information System database''] U.S. Geological Survey. URL accessed 2014-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the total area of the nation is about {{convert|3,800,000|sqmi|km2}}, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of {{convert|1,000|sqmi|km2}} and 300,000 reaches that drain {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from [[regression analysis|indirect statistical analysis]] of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other [[Hydrology#Modeling|hydrologic models]]. Similarly for coastal floods, [[tide gauge]] data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 added information to the global data center between January 2010 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining Tide Gauge Data|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/|website=Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=PSMSL_data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passau flood scale Sept 2012.JPG|thumb|High-water scale 1501-2002 at [[Passau|Passau, Germany]], as of September 2012]]
Much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world, such as the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany,  but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation.

For an individual stream reach, the uncertainties in any analysis can be large, so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}}  For the largest recorded flood at any specific location, or any potentially larger event, the recurrence interval always is poorly known.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20,24}}  Spatial variability adds more uncertainty, because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20}}  If an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood, but no rain falls over another branch, the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years. Conversely, a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream. During a time of flooding, news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location. The public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|7,24}}

==Observed intervals between floods==
Peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|16–19}}  Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of the intervals between 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval. Similarly, the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half  were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.
[[File:Passau flood history.svg|thumb|left|Observed intervals between floods at Passau, 1501-2013]]

==Regulatory use==
In the United States, the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for [[flood insurance]] rates. Complete information on the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) is available [http://www.floodsmart.gov/ here.] A ''regulatory flood'' or ''base flood'' is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval. In addition to historical flood data, the process accounts for previously established regulatory values, the effects of flood-control reservoirs, and changes in land use in the watershed. [[Coastal flood]] hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes. Most areas where serious floods can occur in the United States have been mapped consistently in this manner. On average nationwide, those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the NFIP and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk, if the future is like the past.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Approximately 3% of the U.S. population lives in areas subject to the 1% annual chance coastal flood hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Mark|last2=others|title=An estimate of the U.S. population living in 100-year coastal flood hazard areas|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|date=2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00076.1|url=http://www.floods.org/PDF/JCR_Est_US_Pop_100y_CFHA_2010.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Crowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, removing homes and businesses from areas that flood repeatedly can protect people and reduce insurance losses, but in practice it is difficult for people to retreat from established neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jen |title=Surrendering to rising seas |journal=Scientific American |date=1 August 2018 |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=44-55 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/surrendering-to-rising-seas/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9230">'''Alternative natural materials''' are [[natural materials]] like [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[adobe]] that are not as commonly in use as materials such as [[wood]] or [[iron]].  Alternative natural materials have many practical uses in areas such as [[sustainable architecture]] and [[engineering]]. The main purpose of using such materials is to minimize the negative effects that our built environment can have on the planet while increasing the efficiency and adaptability of the structures.

== History ==

Alternative natural materials have existed for quite some time but often in very basic forms or only as ingredients to a particular material in the past. For example, earth used as a building material for walls of houses has existed for thousands of years. Much more recently, in the 1920s, the United States government promoted [[rammed earth]] as a fireproof construction method for building farmhouses.&lt;ref name=countrysidemag&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Charmaine R.|title=Building for free with "alternative" natural materials|url=http://www.countrysidemag.com/issues/85/85-3/Charmaine_R_Taylor.html|accessdate=2009-04-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090418032445/http://countrysidemag.com/issues/85/85-3/Charmaine_R_Taylor.html| archivedate= 18 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more common example is adobe. Adobe homes are prominent in the southwestern U.S. and several Spanish-speaking countries.&lt;ref name= About&gt;{{cite web|last=Craven|first=Jackie|title=Building With Natural Materials|url=http://architecture.about.com/od/naturalmaterials/Build_With_Natural_Materials.htm|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Straw bale]] construction is a more modern concept, but there even exists evidence that straw was used to make homes in African prairies as far back as the [[Paleolithic]] times.&lt;ref name= About/&gt;
Alternative natural materials, specifically their applications, have only recently made their way into more common use. The ideas of being both green and [[sustainable]] in response to [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] shifted more of a focus onto the materials and methods used to build our [[cityscape]] and homes. As environmentally conscious decisions became commonplace, the use of alternative natural materials instead of typical natural materials or man-made materials that rely heavily on natural resources became prominent.

== Materials ==

=== Rock ===
Rock is a great alternative to conventional materials which contain chemicals that may be harmful to people, pets or the environment. Rocks have two great characteristics: good [[thermal mass]] and [[thermal insulation]]. These characteristics make stone a great idea because the temperature in the house stays rather constant thus requiring less air conditioning and other cooling systems. Types of rocks that can be employed are reject stone (pieces of stone that are not able to be used for another task), [[limestone]], and [[flagstone]].
[[File:Sb-wall-tight-curve.jpg|left|thumb|This article shows a straw bale wall under construction.]]

=== Straw ===
[[Straw-bale construction|Straw bales]] can be used as a basis for walls instead of [[drywall]]. Straw provides excellent insulation and fire resistance in a traditional post-and-beam structure, where a wood frame supports the house.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks&gt;{{cite web|last=Edmonds|first=Molly|title=Top 10 Natural Building Materials|url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/energy-efficiency/10-natural-building-materials.htm|accessdate=2009-04-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402094611/http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/energy-efficiency/10-natural-building-materials.htm|archivedate=2009-04-02|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These straw walls are about 75% more energy efficient than standard drywalls and because no oxygen can get through the walls, fire cannot spread and there is no chance of [[combustion]].
[[File:Construction maison bambou.jpg|right|thumb|This picture depicts a cyclone- and earthquake-resistant home made completely of bamboo.]]

=== Bamboo ===
In Asian countries, [[bamboo]] is being used for structures like bridges and homes. Bamboo is surprisingly strong and rather flexible and grows incredibly fast, making it a rather abundant material. Although it can be difficult to join corners together, bamboo is immensely strong and makes up for the hardships that can be encountered while building it.

=== Cordwood ===
[[Cordwood]] is a combination of small remnants of [[firewood]] and other [[lumber]] that usually go to waste. These small blocks of wood can easily be put together to make a structure that, like stone, has great insulation as well as thermal mass. Cordwood provides the rustic look of log cabins without the use of tons of lumber. You can build an entire building with just cordwood or use stones to fill in the walls.

=== Rammed earth ===
[[Rammed earth]] is a very abundant material that can be used in place of [[concrete]] and [[brick]]. [[Soil]] is packed tightly into wall molds where it is rammed together and hardened to form a durable wall packing made of nothing more than dirt, stones, and sticks.&lt;ref name=howstuffworks/&gt; Rammed Earth also provides great thermal mass, which means great energy savings. In addition, it is very weatherproof and durable enough that it was used in the Great Wall of China.

=== Earth-sheltered ===
[[Earth sheltering]] is a unique building technique in which buildings are completely constructed on at least one side by some form of Earth whether it be a grass roof, clay walls, or both. This unique system usually includes plenty of windows because of the difficulty involved with using too much electricity in such a house. This adds to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the house by reducing lighting costs.

=== Papercrete ===
[[Papercrete]] is an interesting and very new material that is a good substitute for concrete. Papercrete is shredded paper, sand, and cement mixed together that forms a very durable brick-like material. Buildings utilizing papercrete are very well-insulated as well as being termite- and fire-resistant. Papercrete is very cheap as it usually only costs about $0.35 per square foot.

=== Adobe ===
[[Adobe]] is an age-old technique that is cheap, easy to obtain, and ideal for hot environments. A mixture of [[sand]], [[clay]], and water is poured into a mold and left in the sun to dry. When dried, it is exceptionally strong and heat-resistant. Adobe doesn’t let much heat through to the inside of the structure, thus providing excellent insulation during the summer to reduce energy costs. Although this clay mixture provides excellent insulation from heat, it is not very waterproof and can be dangerous in earth-quake prone areas due to its tendency to crack easily.

=== Sawdust ===
[[Sawdust]] is a good material to combine with clay or cement mixtures and use for walls. These walls turn out surprisingly sturdy and effectively recycle any trees that may need to be excavated from the building area. Depending what type of sawdust used ([[hardwood]] is best) the wood chips in the walls absorb moisture and help prevent cracking during freeze/thaw cycles.&lt;ref name=countrysidemag/&gt; Sawdust may be combined with water and frozen to produce a material commonly known as [[pykrete]], which is strong, and less prone to melting than regular ice.

== Examples ==

Although this is a newer technology there are some buildings that have already employed these materials, as well as other tactics, to make themselves green.
*One such building design is the proposed Dubiotech headquarters in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. This designs call for solar panels and windows, which would let plenty of natural light in while also getting maximum use out of the sunlight. This building (under delayed construction since the 2008 financial crisis would also be built with an alternative kind of steel that is not made by a process that releases tons of harsh chemicals into the atmosphere.
*Another example is the School of Art, Media, and Design located in Singapore. This school has a roof made completely of grass (an example of Earth-sheltering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kriscenski|first=Ali|title=Amazing Green Roof Art School in Singapore|url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/01/23/amazing-green-roof-art-school-in-singapore|accessdate=2009-04-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331200621/http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/01/23/amazing-green-roof-art-school-in-singapore| archivedate= 31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the use of less concrete and other materials for the roof, and the building also includes lots of window to utilize natural lighting.

The effect is of primary interest in using bulk matter to detect ultra-high energy [[neutrino]]s. The [[Antarctic Impulse Transient Antenna]] (ANITA) experiment uses antennas attached to a balloon flying over [[Antarctica]] to detect the Askaryan radiation produced as cosmic neutrinos travel through the ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ps.uci.edu/~anita/ ANITA Project Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arianna.ps.uci.edu/ ARIANNA collaboration]&lt;/ref&gt; Several experiments have also used the [[Moon]] as a [[neutrino detector]] based on detection of the Askaryan radiation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~moonemp/public/ GLUE project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvi.nl/~scholten/numoon/numoon.html NuMoon project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/lunaska/index.html LUNASKA project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100708190312/http://resun.physics.uiowa.edu/ RESUN project]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">In [[Geotechnical engineering]] the term '''asperity''' is mostly used for unevenness (''roughness'') of the surface of a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]], grain, or particle with heights in the range from approximately 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm to many decimetre. Smaller unevenness is normally considered to be a ''material'' property (often denoted by ''material friction'' or ''basic material friction'').&lt;ref name=Patton1966/&gt;

==Dilation==

An often used definition for ''asperities'' in geotechnical engineering:&lt;br /&gt;
Unevenness of a surface are ''asperities'' if these cause dilation if two blocks with in between a discontinuity with matching ''asperities'' on the two opposing surfaces (i.e. a ''fitting discontinuity'') move relative to each other, under low stress levels that do not cause breaking of the ''asperities''.

==Contrast with asperity in materials science==

[[Materials science]] recognizes [[asperity (materials science)|asperities]] ranging from the sub-visual (normally less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) to the atomic scale.

'''Bast fibre''' (also called '''phloem fibre''' or '''skin fibre''') is [[plant fibre]] collected from the [[phloem]] (the "inner bark", sometimes called "skin") or '''bast''' surrounding the stem of certain [[dicotyledon]]ous [[plant]]s. They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance [[flax]], [[hemp]], or [[ramie]], but also bast fibres from wild plants, as [[stinging nettle]], and trees such as [[Tilia|lime or linden]], [[wisteria]], and [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] have been used in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Textiles in Daily Life: Proceedings of the Third Biennial Symposium of the Textile Society of America, September 24–26 1992 |chapter=A Wisteria Grain Bag And Other Tree Bast Fiber Textiles Of Japan |chapter-url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/tsaconf/569/ |author=Mary Dusenbury |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible.&lt;ref name=Esau&gt;{{cite book |author=Esau, K. |date=12 January 1977  |title=Anatomy of seed plants |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-24520-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibres from [[monocotyledon]]ous plants, called "leaf fibre", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff.&lt;ref name=Esau/&gt;

Since the valuable fibres are located in the phloem, they must often be separated from the [[xylem]] material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]. The process for this is called [[retting]], and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance [[high pH]] and [[chelating]] agents) or by [[pectin]]olytic [[enzyme]]s. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by [[pectin]] and [[calcium]] [[ion]]s. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher [[tensile strength]] than other kinds, and are used in high-quality [[textile]]s (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), [[rope]]s, [[yarn]], [[paper]], [[composite material]]s and [[burlap]]. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the ''fibre node'', that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.

==Use of bast fibre==
Plants that have been used for bast fibre include [[flax]] (from which [[linen]] is made), [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[kenaf]], [[kudzu]], [[tilia|linden]], [[milkweed]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], [[okra]], [[paper mulberry]], [[ramie]], and [[roselle hemp]].

Bast fibres are processed for use in [[carpet]], [[yarn]], [[rope]], [[geotextile]] (netting or matting), traditional carpets, [[burlap|hessian or burlap]], [[paper]], sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the [[non-woven]], moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc.  From prehistoric times through at least the early twentieth century, [[bast shoe]]s were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe.

Where no other source of [[tanbark]] was available, bast has also been used for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] leather.&lt;ref name="HCC, Juchten"&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:CCL SECTION.jpg|thumb|right|Encased in a cement tunnel for a [[particle accelerator]] in most cases underground, is the ''beam line'' or beam pipe. Picture depicts the transducers and complicated apparatus to produce a beam just outside of the beam pipe Note: above the beamline the [[Ionization chamber]]s.]]
--&gt;
[[Image:Beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Beamline at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].]]
In [[accelerator physics]], a '''beamline''' refers to the trajectory of the beam of accelerated particles, including the overall construction of the path segment (vacuum tube, magnets, diagnostic devices) along a specific path of an [[particle accelerator|accelerator]] facility. This part is either
* the line in a [[linear accelerator]] along which a [[part beam|beam]] of [[subatomic particle|particles]] travels, or
* the path leading from a cyclic accelerator to the experimental endstation (as in [[synchrotron light source]]s or [[cyclotron]]s).

Beamlines usually end in experimental stations that utilize [[particle beam]]s or [[synchrotron light]] obtained from a [[synchrotron]], or [[neutrons]] from a [[spallation source]] or [[research reactor]].  Beamlines are used in experiments in [[particle physics]], [[materials science]], [[chemistry]], and [[molecular biology]].

==Beamline in a particle accelerator==
[[Image:LINAC.jpg|thumb|right|220px|It is impossible to see the beam pipe on this beamline. However the section of the '''big beam pipe''' is used with a grid system for alignment with a [[laser]], known as the laser pipe. This particular ''beamline'' is approximately 3 kilometers long.]]

In [[particle accelerator]]s the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a concrete housing. The beamline is usually a cylindrical metal pipe, typically called a ''beam pipe'', and/or a ''drift tube'', evacuated to a high [[vacuum]] so there are few gas molecules in the path for the beam of accelerated particles to hit, which would scatter them before they reach their destination.

There are specialized devices and equipment on the beamline that are used for producing, maintaining, monitoring, and accelerating the particle beam. These devices may be in proximity or attached to the beamline. These devices include sophisticated [[transducer]]s, diagnostics (position monitors and [[wire scanner]]s), [[Electrostatic lens|lenses]], [[collimator]]s, [[thermocouple]]s, [[ion pump]]s, [[ion gauge]]s, [[Ionization chamber|ion chambers]] (sometimes called "beam loss monitors"), vacuum valves ("isolation valves"), and [[gate valve]]s, to mention a few. There are also water cooling devices to cool the [[dipole magnet|dipole]] and [[quadrupole magnet]]s. Positive pressure, such as that provided by [[compressed air]], regulates and controls the [[vacuum]] [[valve]]s and manipulators on the beamline.

It is imperative to have all beamline sections, magnets, etc., aligned by a [[Surveying|survey]] and alignment crew by using a [[laser tracker]]. All beamlines must be within [[micrometre]] tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates [[secondary emission]]s and/or [[radiation]].

Regarding [[synchrotron]]s, ''beamline'' may also refer to the instrumentation that carries beams of [[synchrotron radiation]] to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the [[bending magnet]]s and [[insertion device]]s in the [[storage ring]] of a [[List of synchrotron radiation facilities|synchrotron radiation facility]]. A typical application for this kind of beamline is [[crystallography]], although many other [[:Category:Synchrotron-related techniques|techniques]] utilising [[synchrotron light]] exist.

At a large synchrotron facility there will be many beamlines, each optimised for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station.  A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron facility will be 25 to 100 m long from the [[storage ring]] to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines opening on day one of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.

The beamline elements are located in radiation shielding enclosures, called [[Hutch (synchrotron)|hutch]]es, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. Entrance to the hutches is forbidden when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. This is enforced by the use of elaborate safety systems with redundant [[Interlock (engineering)|interlocking functions]], which make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is [[beam dump|dumped]], meaning the stored beam is diverted into a target designed to absorb and contain its energy.

Elements that are used in beamlines by experimenters for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station include the following:

*Windows - thin sheets of metal, often [[beryllium]], which transmit almost all of the beam, but protect the vacuum within the storage ring from contamination
*Slits - which control the physical width of the beam and its angular spread
*Focusing mirrors - one or more mirrors, which may be flat, bent-flat, or [[toroid (geometry)|toroid]]al, which helps to [[collimator|collimate]] (focus) the beam
*Monochromators - devices based on [[diffraction]] by crystals which select particular [[wavelength]] bands and absorb other wavelengths, and which are sometimes tunable to varying wavelengths, and sometimes fixed to a particular wavelength
*Spacing tubes - vacuum maintaining tubes which provide the proper space between optical elements, and shield any scattered radiation
*Sample stages - for mounting and manipulating the sample under study and subjecting it to various external conditions, such a varying temperature, pressure etc.
*Radiation detectors - for measuring the radiation which has interacted with the sample

The combination of beam conditioning devices controls the [[thermal load]] (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or [[liquid nitrogen]]. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under [[ultra high vacuum]] conditions.

===Software for beamline modeling===
Although the design of a synchrotron radiation beamline may be seen as an application of X-ray optics, there are dedicated tools for modeling the x-ray propagation down the beamline and their interaction with various components.  There are ray-tracing codes such as [http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/raytracing/ Shadow] and [http://www.mcxtrace.org/ McXTrace] that treat the x-ray beam in the geometric optics limit, and then there are wave propagation software that takes into account diffraction, and the intrinsic wavelike properties of the radiation.  For the purposes of understanding full or partial coherence of the synchrotron radiation, the wave properties need to be taken into account.  The codes [https://github.com/ochubar/SRW SRW] and [http://radiant.harima.riken.go.jp/spectra/ Spectra] include this possibility.

==Neutron beamline==
An experimental end station in a neutron facility is called a neutron beamline. Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a [[research reactor]] or a [[spallation source]] instead of photons. The experiments usually measure [[neutron scattering]] from the sample under study.

[[File:Comparison Bioresilience with Biodiversity.jpg|thumb|Comparing the Features of Bioresilience and Biodiversity as Found on a Mountain Slope]]
'''Bioresilience''' refers to the ability of a whole [[species]] or an [[individual]] of a species to adapt to change. Initially the term applied to changes in the [[natural environment]], but increasingly it is also used for adaptation to anthropogenically induced change.&lt;ref name=r0&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi= 10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first to note the resilience of [[life forms]] with increasing [[altitude]] and the accompanying decreasing prevalence in numbers, and he documented this in the 18th century on the slopes of the volcano [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea |last=Wulf |title=The Invention of Nature |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1171659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of bioresilience evolved from research led by [[The Mountain Institute]] when establishing two of the national parks that surround [[Mount Everest]], [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] in [[Nepal]], and [[Qomolangma National Nature Preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.B |last=Shrestha |title=Development Ecology of the Arun River Basin in Nepal |location=Kathmandu |publisher=International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research documented greater [[biodiversity]] at Everest’s base than higher up. There were progressively fewer documented species as the mountain ascended into higher [[biomes]], from [[subtropical]] to [[temperate]] to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] to Arctic-like. These fewer species, though, had greater biologic [[robustness]] correlating directly with increasing bioresilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Taylor-Ide |title=Something Hidden Behind the Ranges: A Himalayan Quest |location=San Francisco |publisher=Mercury House |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current research==
Monitoring of bioresilience, beginning in the [[Everest]] ecosystem but expanding to other mountain ecologies globally is being carried out by the Biomeridian Project at [[Future Generations University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Impacts on Life from Climate Change|url=https://www.future.edu/biomeridian/|website=Future Generations University|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of bioresilience has also been applied to human health to explain aging or chronic diseases decrease the ability of the body to adapt; in such cases, the system becomes rigid and unable to cross different life demands. As the human body loses robustness with age, an individual becomes unable to accommodate new life demands, be they contagions, stress, or events such as injury or even jet lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Yun |first=Joon | title=The Key To Health In Old Age: Bioresilience | website=[[Forbes]] | date=June 18, 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/06/18/the-key-to-health-in-old-age-bioresillience/|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of resilience in biological systems has been widely recognized in terms of the impacts on life by anthropogenic changes.&lt;ref name=r0/&gt; Accelerating environmental change and continuing loss of genetic resources positions lower biodiversity around the planet threatening ecosystem services. A major mitigating factor will be life forms with higher resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oliver |first=Tom H. |last2= Heard |first2=Mathew S. |first3= Nick J.B. |last3=Isaac |last4= Roy |first4=David B. |first5=Deborah |last5=Procter |first6=Felix |last6=Eigenbrod |first7=Rob |last7=Freckleton |first8=Andy |last8=Hector |first9=C.

Paralleling the work in mountain environments, a growing number of studies is applying the concept of bioresilience to assess the robustness of life in other ecological systems challenged by the Anthropocene. One such study was with the adaptive renewal and natural perturbation in Lake Victoria, the world’s second largest freshwater lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Awiti |first=Alex O. |title=Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria |journal=[[Ecology &amp; Society]] |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30882">[[Image:Sonoluminescence.png|right|600px|thumb|Left to right: formation of bubble; slow expansion; quick and sudden contraction; purported fusion event.]]
'''Bubble fusion''' is the non-technical name for a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction hypothesized to occur inside extraordinarily large collapsing gas bubbles created in a liquid during [[Sonic cavitation|acoustic cavitation]]. The more technical name is '''sonofusion'''.&lt;ref name="Chang-practical"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 2002 with the release of a report by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan]] and collaborators that claimed to have observed evidence of sonofusion. The claim was quickly surrounded by controversy, including allegations ranging from experimental error to academic fraud. Subsequent publications claiming independent verification of sonofusion were also highly controversial.

Eventually, an investigation by [[Purdue University]] found that Taleyarkhan had engaged in falsification of independent verification, and had included a student as an author on a paper when he had not participated in the research. He was subsequently stripped of his professorship. One of his funders, the [[Office of Naval Research]] reviewed the report by Purdue and barred him from federal funding for 28 months.&lt;ref name=reich /&gt;

In the March 8, 2002 issue of the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|Rusi P. Taleyarkhan]] and colleagues at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)]] reported that acoustic cavitation experiments conducted with [[Deuterium|deuterated]] [[acetone]] ({{carbon|3}}{{deuterium|6}}{{oxygen}}) showed measurements of [[tritium]] and [[neutron]] output consistent with the occurrence of fusion. The neutron emission was also reported to be coincident with the [[sonoluminescence]] pulse, a key indicator that its source was fusion caused by the heat and pressure inside the collapsing bubbles.&lt;ref name="Taleyarkhan-2002-03-08"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taleyarkhan|first=R.

The results were so startling, that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory asked two independent researchers, D. Shapira and M. J. Saltmarsh, to repeat the experiment using more sophisticated [[neutron detection]] equipment. They reported that the neutron release was consistent with random coincidence.&lt;ref name="Shapira-2002-08-19"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal by Taleyarkhan and the other authors of the original report argued that the Shapira and Saltmarsh report failed to account for significant differences in experimental setup, including over an inch of shielding between the neutron detector and the sonoluminescing acetone. According to Taleyarkhan ''et al.'', when properly considering those differences, the results were consistent with fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubble Fusion takes next hurdle|author=Haiko Lietz|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/20/20542/1.html|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 2002, while experimental work was still in progress, Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University, in a letter to the journal ''Science''&lt;ref name="Galonsky-2002-09-06"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
expressed doubts about the claim made by the Taleyarkhan team. In Galonsky's opinion, the observed neutrons were too high in energy to be from a [[deuterium]]-deuterium (d-d) fusion reaction. In their response (published on the same page), the Taleyarkhan team provided detailed  counter-arguments and concluded that the energy was "reasonably close" to that which was expected from a fusion reaction.

In February 2005 the documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' commissioned two leading sonoluminescence researchers, Seth Putterman&lt;ref name="Putterman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174400/http://personnel.physics.ucla.edu/directory/faculty/putterman |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}, Seth Putterman personal page.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth S. Suslick]], to reproduce Taleyarkhan's work. Using similar acoustic parameters, deuterated acetone, similar bubble nucleation, and a much more sophisticated neutron detection device, the researchers could find no evidence of a fusion reaction.&lt;ref name="BBC-2005-02-17"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results differed from the original results in that fusion was claimed to occur over longer times than previously reported. The original report only claimed neutron emission from the initial bubble collapse following bubble nucleation, whereas this report claimed neutron emission many acoustic cycles later.

In July 2005, two of Taleyarkhan's students at [[Purdue University]] published evidence confirming the previous result. They used the same acoustic chamber, the same deuterated acetone fluid and a similar bubble nucleation system.

  }} "...The experiment was specifically designed to address a fundamental research question, not to make a device that would be capable of producing [[energy]], Block says...To verify the presence of fusion, the researchers used three independent [[neutron]] detectors and one gamma ray detector. All four detectors produced the same results: a statistically significant increase in the amount of nuclear emissions due to sonofusion when compared to background levels..."
&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, in the midst of accusations concerning Taleyarkhan's research standards, two different scientists visited the meta-stable fluids research lab at Purdue University to measure neutrons, using Taleyarkhan's equipment. Dr. Edward R. Forringer and undergraduates David Robbins and Jonathan Martin of [[LeTourneau University]] presented two papers at the [[American Nuclear Society]] Winter Meeting that reported replication of neutron emission. Their experimental setup was similar to previous experiments in that it used a mixture of deuterated acetone, [[deuterated benzene]], [[tetrachloroethylene]] and [[uranyl nitrate]]. Notably, however, it operated without an external neutron source and used two types of [[Neutron detection|neutron detectors]]. They claimed a liquid [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detector measured neutron levels at 8 [[standard deviation]]s above the background level, while plastic detectors measured levels at 3.8 standard deviations above the background. When the same experiment was performed with non-deuterated [[Experimental control|control]] liquid, the measurements were within one standard deviation of background, indicating that the neutron production had only occurred during cavitation of the deuterated liquid.&lt;ref name="LeTourneau-2006-11-17"&gt;"Bubble Fusion Confirmed by LETU Research" LeTourneau University News (www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/events/Bubble_Fusion_Confirmed_by_LETU_Research.html) link inactive as of 2008-05-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANS-pgm"&gt;{{cite web

In March 2006, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published a special report that called into question the validity of the results of the Purdue experiments.&lt;ref name="silencing"&gt;{{cite journal

Tsoukalas, head of the School of Nuclear Engineering at Purdue, and several of his colleagues at Purdue, had convinced Taleyarkhan to move to Purdue and attempt a joint replication. In the 2006 ''Nature'' report they detail several troubling issues when trying to collaborate with Taleyarkhan. He reported positive results from certain set of raw data, but his colleagues had also examined that set and it only contained negative results. He never showed his colleagues the raw data corresponding to the positive results, despite several requests. He moved the equipment from a shared laboratory to his own laboratory, thus impeding review by his colleagues, and he didn't give any advance warning or explanation for the move. Taleyarkhan convinced his colleagues that they shouldn't publish a paper with their negative results. Taleyarkhan then insisted that the university's press release present his experiment as "peer-reviewed" and "independent", when the co-authors were working in his laboratory under his supervision, and his peers in the faculty were not allowed to review the data. In summary, Taleyarkhan's colleagues at Purdue said he placed obstacles to peer review of his experiments, and they had serious doubts about the validity of the research.&lt;ref name="silencing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hot air"&gt;{{cite journal

  |journal = Nature News
  |doi     = 10.1038/news060306-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nature'' also revealed that the process of anonymous peer-review had not been followed, and that the journal ''Nuclear Engineering and Design'' was not independent from the authors. Taleyarkhan was co-editor of the journal, and the paper was only peer-reviewed by his co-editor, with Taleyarkhan's knowledge.&lt;ref name="hot air"/&gt;

In 2002 Taleyarkhan  filed a patent application on behalf of the United States Department of Energy, while working in Oak Ridge. ''Nature'' reported that the patent had been rejected in 2005 by the US Patent Office. The examiner called the experiment a variation of discredited [[cold fusion]], found that there was "no reputable evidence of record to support any allegations or claims that the invention is capable of operating as indicated", and found that there was not enough detail for others to replicate the invention. The field of fusion suffered from many flawed claims, thus the examiner asked for additional proof that the radiation was generated from fusion and not from other sources. An appeal was not filed because the Department of Energy had dropped the claim in December 2005.&lt;ref name="hot air_2"&gt;{{cite journal

== Doubts prompt investigation ==
Doubts among Purdue University's Nuclear Engineering faculty as to whether the positive results reported from sonofusion experiments conducted there were truthful prompted the university to initiate a review of the research, conducted by Purdue's Office of the Vice President for Research. In a March 9, 2006 article entitled "Evidence for bubble fusion called into question", ''Nature'' interviewed several of Taleyarkhan's colleagues who suspected something was amiss.&lt;ref name="Reich-2006-03-09"&gt;{{cite journal

On February 7, 2007, the Purdue University administration determined that "the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted". Their report also stated that "vigorous, open debate of the scientific merits of this new technology is the most appropriate focus going forward."&lt;ref name="Purdue-2007-02-07"&gt;{{cite news

On July 18, 2008, Purdue University announced that a committee with members from five institutions had investigated 12 allegations of research misconduct against Rusi Taleyarkhan.  It concluded that two allegations were founded—that Taleyarkhan had claimed independent confirmation of his work when in reality the apparent confirmations were done by Taleyarkhan's former students and was not as "independent" as Taleyarkhan implied, and that Taleyarkhan had included a colleague's name on one of his papers who had not actually been involved in the research ("the sole apparent motivation for the addition of Mr. Butt was a desire to overcome a reviewer's criticism", the report concluded).&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web

Taleyarkhan's appeal of the report's conclusions was rejected.  He said the two allegations of misconduct were trivial administrative issues and had nothing to do with the discovery of bubble nuclear fusion or the underlying science, and that "all allegations of fraud and fabrication have been dismissed as invalid and without merit — thereby supporting the underlying science and experimental data as being on solid ground".&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A researcher questioned by the LA Times said that the report had not clarified whether bubble fusion was real or not, but that the low quality of the papers and the doubts cast by the report had destroyed Taleyarkhan's credibility with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-misconduct19-2008jul19,0,1765099.story Purdue physicist found guilty of misconduct], Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2008, Thomas H. Maugh II&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2008 he was stripped of his named Arden Bement Jr. Professorship, and forbidden to be a thesis advisor for graduate students for at least the next 3 years.&lt;ref name="Nature_India_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news

Despite the findings against him, Taleyarkhan received a $185,000 grant from the [[National Science Foundation]]  between September 2008 and August 2009 to investigate bubble fusion. In 2009 the Office of Naval Research debarred him for 28 months, until September 2011, from receiving U.S. Federal Funding. During that period his name was listed in the 'Excluded Parties List' to prevent him from receiving further grants from any government agency.&lt;ref name=reich&gt;{{cite magazine |author= Reich, Eugenie Samuel |title= Bubble-fusion scientist debarred from federal funding |magazine=[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]] |date= 23 November 2009 |doi= 10.1038/news.2009.1103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and significance==
{{Life timeline}}
{{main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by [[William Buckland]] in the 1840s,&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"&gt;{{cite book| author=Buckland, W. |authorlink=William Buckland| year=1841| title=Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to Natural Theology| publisher=Lea &amp; Blanchard| isbn=1-147-86894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] discussed the then inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"&gt;{{cite book| title=On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection| author=Darwin, C| authorlink=Charles Darwin| year=1859| pages=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=324&amp;itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text 202, 306–308]| publisher=Murray| location=London| isbn=1-60206-144-0| oclc=176630493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian [[fauna]], seemingly abruptly, without precursor, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin of animal life. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

The first discovered Cambrian fossils were [[trilobites]], described by [[Edward Lhuyd]], the curator of [[Oxford Museum]], in 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liñán |first1=E.|last2=Gonzalo |first2=R|editor1-last=Rábano |editor1-first=I.|editor2-last=Gozalo|editor2-first=R.|editor3-last=García-Bellido |editor3-first=D.|title=Advances in Trilobite Research|year=2008|publisher=Instituto Geológico y Minero de España |location=Madrid |isbn=978-84-7840-759-0 |page=240 |chapter=Cryptopalaeontology: Magical descriptions of trilobites about two thousand years before scientific references}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their evolutionary importance was not known, on the basis of their old age, William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record had occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="Buckland1841"/&gt; Nineteenth-century geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]] used the fossils for dating rock strata, specifically for establishing the [[Cambrian]] and [[Silurian]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Mark |title=Fossil Focus: Trilobites |journal=Palaeontology Online |year=2013 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1–9 |url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2013/fossil-focus-trilobites/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison, were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others, including [[Charles Lyell]], differed. In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] considered this sudden appearance of a solitary group of trilobites, with no apparent antecedents, and absence of other fossils, to be "undoubtedly of the gravest nature" among the difficulties in his theory of natural selection. He reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="OriginOfSpecies"/&gt; In the sixth edition of his book, he stressed his problem further as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles R. |title=The origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection |date=1876 |page=286 |edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.}}

American paleontologist [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], who studied the [[Fossils of the Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale fauna]], proposed that an interval of time, the "Lipalian", was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Charles Doolittle Walcott | title=Cambrian Geology and Paleontology |journal=Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections |volume=57 |page=14 |author=Walcott, C.D. |year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier fossil evidence has since been found. The earliest claim is that the history of life on earth goes back {{Ma|3850|million years}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Heinrich D. Holland |title=Evidence for life on earth more than 3850 million years ago |journal=Science |author=Holland, Heinrich D |date= January 3, 1997 |doi=10.1126/science.275.5296.38 |volume=275 |pmid=11536783 |issue=5296 |pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocks of that age at [[Warrawoona, Australia]], were claimed to contain fossil [[stromatolite]]s, stubby pillars formed by colonies of [[microorganism]]s. Fossils (''[[Grypania]]'') of more complex [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, from which all animals, plants, and fungi are built, have been found in rocks from {{Ma|1400}}, in [[China]] and [[Montana]]. Rocks dating from {{Ma|580|543}} contain fossils of the [[Ediacara biota]], organisms so large that they are likely multicelled, but very unlike any modern organism.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt; In 1948, [[Preston Cloud]] argued that a period of "eruptive" evolution occurred in the Early Cambrian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cloud, P.E. | year=1948 |title=Some problems and patterns of evolution exemplified by fossil invertebrates | journal=Evolution | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=322–350 | doi=10.2307/2405523 | pmid=18122310 | jstor=2405523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but as recently as the 1970s, no sign was seen of how the 'relatively' modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late [[Cambrian]] arose.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;

[[File:Opabinia BW2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Opabinia]]'' made the largest single contribution to modern interest in the Cambrian explosion.]]

The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of [[Harry B. Whittington]] and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, reanalysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale and concluded that several were as complex as, but different from, any living animals.&lt;ref name="Whittington1979Lawn"&gt;Whittington, H. B. (1979). Early arthropods, their appendages and relationships. In M. R. House (Ed.), The origin of major invertebrate groups (pp. 253–268). The Systematics Association Special Volume, 12. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Burgess Shale | author=Whittington, H.B. | authorlink=Harry B. Whittington |author2=Geological Survey of Canada | year=1985 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=0-660-11901-3 | oclc=15630217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common organism, ''[[Marrella]]'', was clearly an [[arthropod]], but not a member of any known arthropod [[class (biology)|class]]. Organisms such as the five-eyed ''[[Opabinia]]'' and spiny slug-like ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, seemingly unrelated to anything known today. [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s popular 1989 account of this work, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'',&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"&gt;{{cite book| title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History
| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn=0-393-02705-8| oclc=185746546
}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought the matter into the public eye and raised questions about what the explosion represented. While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared almost simultaneously in a rather short span of geological period. This view led to the modernization of Darwin's tree of life and the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which [[Niles Eldredge|Eldredge]] and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2004EarlySkeletalFossils"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | chapter=Early skeletal fossils

Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AwramikStromatoliteDiversityMetazoanAppearance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FedonkinWaggoner1997KimberellaMollusc"/&gt;

===Dating the Cambrian===
[[radiometric dating|Radiometric]] dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only recently become available, and for only a few regions.

Relative dating (''A'' was before ''B'') is often assumed sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this, too, has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different [[continent]]s.&lt;ref name="DatingProblems"&gt;e.g. {{Cite journal| last = Gehling| first = James| last2 = Jensen| first2 = Sören| last3 = Droser| first3 = Mary

Therefore, dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.

===Body fossils===
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by [[erosion]] or [[metamorphism]] before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered. Despite this, they are often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history.&lt;ref name="BentonQualityFossilRecord"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benton MJ |author2=Wills MA |author3=Hitchin R |title=Quality of the fossil record through time |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6769 |pages=534–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10676959 |doi=10.1038/35000558|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..534B }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, biases exist in the fossil record: different environments are more favourable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003ExceptionalFossilPreservation"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Butterfield, N.J. | year =2003 | title = Exceptional Fossil Preservation and the Cambrian Explosion | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–177 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.166 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | access-date=2008-06-28 | pmid=21680421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although 30-plus phyla of living animals are known, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"&gt;{{cite book | author=Cowen, R. | title=History of Life | publisher=Blackwell Science | isbn=1-4051-1756-7| year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[Lagerstätte]] are.]]
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of [[lagerstätte]]n, which preserve soft tissues. These allow [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian [[Maotianshan shale]] beds of Chengjiang ([[Yunnan]], [[China]]) and [[Sirius Passet]] ([[Greenland]]);&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1979"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late Cambrian [[Orsten]] ([[Sweden]]) fossil beds.

While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt; In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.

The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record&amp;nbsp;– this is known as the [[Signor–Lipps effect]].&lt;ref name="Signor1982"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Signor |first1=P.W. |last2=Lipps|first2=J.H. |chapter=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in the fossil record |editor-last=Silver|editor-first=L.T.|editor2-last=Schulz|editor2-first=P.H. |title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the earth |id=A 84–25651 10–42|pages=291–296 |publisher=Geological Society of America |year=1982 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efz87W88HawC&amp;pg=291&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0813721903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such changes may reflect a cause of the Cambrian explosion, although they may also have resulted from an increased level of biological activity&amp;nbsp;– a possible result of the explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt; Despite these uncertainties, the geochemical evidence helps by making scientists focus on theories that are consistent with at least one of the likely environmental changes.

===Phylogenetic techniques===
[[Cladistics]] is a technique for working out the "family tree" of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of [[clade]]s&amp;nbsp;– groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.

From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. about how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived &amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A [[phylum]] is the highest level in the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system for classifying organisms]]. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Valentine

}}"&lt;cite&gt;Classifications of organisms in hierarchical systems were in use by the 17th and 18th centuries. Usually, organisms were grouped according to their morphological similarities as perceived by those early workers, and those groups were then grouped according to their similarities, and so on, to form a hierarchy.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their internal and developmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}"&lt;cite&gt;Evolutionary biologists often make sense of the conflicting diversity of form&amp;nbsp;– not always does a relationship between internal and external parts. Early in the history of the subject, it became obvious that internal organisations were generally more important to the higher classification of animals than are external shapes. The internal organisation puts general restrictions on how an animal can exchange gases, obtain nutrients, and reproduce.&lt;/cite&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite their obvious differences, [[spider]]s and [[barnacle]]s both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but [[earthworm]]s and [[tapeworm]]s, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.  As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification system]] created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jefferies1979OriginOfChordates"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1979 | title=The origin of chordates&amp;nbsp;– a methodological essay | editor=House, M.R. | series=The origin of major invertebrate groups | pages=443–477 | publisher=Academic Press | location=London }} summarised in {{cite journal | author=Budd, G.E. | title=The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=157–165 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/157 | year=2003 | pmid=21680420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem group===
The concept of [[stem group]]s was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups, and have been hypothesized based on this scientific theory. A [[crown group]] is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a relative concept, for example [[tardigrade]]s are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.&lt;ref name="CraskeJefferies1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Craske, A.J. | author2=Jefferies, R.P.S. | year=1989 | title=A new mitrate from the Upper Ordovician of Norway, and a new approach to subdividing a plesion | journal=Palaeontology | volume=32 | pages=69–99 | url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf | format=PDF | access-date=2010-12-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824010939/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2032/Pages%2069-99.pdf# | archive-date=2011-08-24 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budd1996"&gt;{{cite journal

Groups that cannot easily be placed in an existing phylum are considered to be [[stem group]]s. A stem group annelid, for instance, is any group that was closely related to, but not within, the crown group "annelida". The stem group split off from the lineage that would lead to annelids, and eventually became extinct.

===Triploblastic===
The term ''[[Triploblastic]]'' means consisting of three layers, which are formed in the [[embryo]], quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the [[digestive tract]] (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic&amp;nbsp;– the best-known exceptions are [[Porifera]] (sponges) and [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).

===Bilaterian===
The [[bilateria]]ns are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life histories. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living [[echinoderm]]s ([[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]], etc.) 'look' radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paired gill slits in a fossil with a calcite skeleton | journal=Nature | issue=6891 | pages=841–844 |date=June 2002 | doi=10.1038/nature00805 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6891/abs/nature00805.html |author1=Dominguez, P. |author2=Jacobson, A.G. |author3=Jefferies, R.P.S. | volume=417 | pmid=12075349 | issn=0028-0836 |bibcode = 2002Natur.417..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, not bilaterian, and not triploblastic.

===Coelomate===
The term ''[[Coelomate]]'' means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, [[annelid]] worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and [[chordate]]s&amp;nbsp;– the noncoelomate [[priapulid]]s are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom&amp;nbsp;– for example [[flatworm]]s, whose organs are surrounded by [[parenchyma|unspecialized tissues]].

==Precambrian life==
Understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&amp;nbsp;– did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?

[[Phylogenetic analysis]] has been used to support the view that during the Cambrian explosion, metazoans (multi-celled animals) evolved [[monophyly|monophyletically]] from a single common ancestor: flagellated colonial [[protists]] similar to modern [[choanoflagellates]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago ===

[[File:Stromatolites in Sharkbay.jpg|right|thumb|Modern stromatolites in [[Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve]], Western Australia]]

Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of [[microorganism]]s, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about {{Ma|2700}}, but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about {{Ma|1250}}. This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.&lt;ref name="McNamara1996DatingOriginAnimals"&gt;

Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as [[acritarch]]s. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small [[animal|metazoans]] to resting [[cyst]]s of many different kinds of [[chlorophyta|green algae]]. After appearing around {{Ma|2000}}, acritarchs underwent a boom around {{Ma|1000}}, increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape, and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the [[Neoproterozoic]] era also show signs of antipredator defenses.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.&lt;ref name="Stanley2008"&gt;

Around the start of the Cambrian (about {{Ma|542}}), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as ''[[Diplocraterion]]'' and ''[[Skolithos]]'', and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as ''[[Cruziana]]'' and ''[[Rusophycus]]''. The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard [[exoskeleton]]s, although they were not necessarily mineralised.&lt;ref name="Jensen2003" /&gt;

Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile, bottom-dwelling organisms.{{Citation needed|reason=try Budd|date=June 2008}} They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"/&gt;

This new habit changed the seafloor's geochemistry, and led to decreased oxygen in the ocean and increased CO2-levels in the seas and the atmosphere, resulting in global warming for tens of millions years, and could be responsible for mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/46647-global-warming-animals-cambrian-carbon-dioxide Early Global Warming Was Unexpectedly Caused by a Burst of Tiny Life Forms - Inverse]&lt;/ref&gt; But as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own,&lt;!--this is carefully worded so as not to imply that was neither a part of the Cambrian explosion, or necessarily different from it&amp;nbsp;– please take this into account when rewording!--&gt; for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them&amp;nbsp;– creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.&lt;ref name="Seilacher2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seilacher, Adolf |author2=Luis A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seems little doubt that ''Kimberella'' was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006"/&gt; These organisms are central to the debate about how abrupt the Cambrian explosion was. If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).

===Beck Spring Dolomite===
Paul Knauth, a geologist at [[Arizona State University]], maintains that photosynthesizing organisms such as algae may have grown over a 750- to 800-million-year-old formation in [[Death Valley]] known as the Beck Spring Dolomite. In the early 1990s, samples from this 1,000-foot thick layer of dolomite revealed that the region housed flourishing mats of photosynthesizing, unicellular life forms which antedated the Cambrian explosion.

Microfossils have been unearthed from holes riddling the otherwise barren surface of the dolomite. These geochemical and microfossil findings support the idea that during the Precambrian period, complex life evolved both in the oceans and on land. Knauth contends that animals may well have had their origins in freshwater lakes and streams, and not in the oceans.

Some 30 years later, a number of studies have documented an abundance of geochemical and microfossil evidence showing that life covered the continents as far back as 2.2 billion years ago. Many paleobiologists now accept the idea that simple life forms existed on land during the Precambrian, but are opposed to the more radical idea that multicellular life thrived on land more than 600 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-valleys-first-life-came-in-by-land-not-by-sea/ "Scientific American" April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are as hard to classify as most other Ediacaran organisms, they are important in two other ways.

In the lowest Cambrian, the stromatolites were decimated. This allowed animals to begin colonization of warm-water pools with carbonate sedimentation. At first, it was [[anabaritid]]s and ''[[Protohertzina]]'' (the fossilized grasping spines of [[Chaetognatha|chaetognaths]]) fossils. Such mineral skeletons as shells, sclerites, thorns, and plates appeared in uppermost [[Nemakit-Daldynian]]; they were the earliest species of [[halkieria|halkierids]], [[Helcionelloida|gastropods]], [[hyolitha|hyoliths]] and other rare organisms.

==Cambrian life==
=== Trace fossils ===

===Small shelly fauna===
{{Main|Small shelly fauna}}
Fossils known as "[[small shelly fauna]]" have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the [[Nemakit-Daldynian]] and [[Tommotian]] ages; see [[#Timeline|timeline]]). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, [[archeocyathid]]s (sponge-like animals), and small shells very like those of [[brachiopod]]s and snail-like molluscs&amp;nbsp;– but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref name="Matthews1975"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstätten: a period of time otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.

===Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms===

The fossil record of trilobites began with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.

The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late [[Atdabanian]]; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.&lt;ref name="DornbosBottjer2000Helicoplacoids"&gt;{{cite journal

These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.

===Burgess Shale type faunas===
{{main|Burgess Shale type preservation}}
The Burgess Shale and similar lagerstätten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provide a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft-bodied, hence absent from the rest of the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003"&gt;{{cite journal

Because the lagerstätten provide a mode and quality of preservation that is virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, many organisms appear completely different from anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from [[stem group|lineages]] before they established the phyla known today{{Clarify|date=August 2008}}&amp;nbsp;– slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.

The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life&amp;nbsp;– perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.&lt;ref name="Xiao2002"&gt;{{cite journal

Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambrian record of crown-group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish [[Orsten]] horizons contain later Cambrian crustaceans, but only organisms smaller than 2&amp;nbsp;mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.

A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the [[Mount Cap formation]], Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage ({{Ma|510|515}}) consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with [[hydrofluoric acid]]. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (about 30&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref&gt;{{PalAss2007|title=The ecology and phylogeny of Cambrian pancrustaceans|author=Harvey, T.P.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification; specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.&lt;ref name="Harvey2008"/&gt;

Different authors break the explosion down into stages in different ways.

Ed Landing recognizes three stages: Stage 1, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, corresponds to a diversification of biomineralizing animals and of deep and complex burrows; Stage 2, corresponding to the radiation of molluscs and stem-group [[Brachiopod]]s ([[hyolith]]s and [[tommotiid]]s), which apparently arose in intertidal waters; and Stage 3, seeing the Atdabanian diversification of trilobites in deeper waters, but little change in the intertidal realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Landing | first1=E. | last2=Kouchinsky | first2=A.

Graham Budd synthesises various schemes to produce a compatible view of the SSF record of the Cambrian explosion, divided slightly differently into four intervals: a "Tube world", lasting from {{Ma|550|536}}, spanning the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, dominated by Cloudina, Namacalathus and pseudoconodont-type elements; a "Sclerite world", seeing the rise of halkieriids, tommotiids, and hyoliths, lasting to the end of the Fortunian (c. 525 Ma); a brachiopod world, perhaps corresponding to the as yet unratified Cambrian Stage 2; and Trilobite World, kicking off in Stage 3.&lt;ref name="Budd, G.E. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Budd | first1=G.E. | last2=Jackson | first2=I.S.C. | year=2016 | title=Ecological innovations in the Cambrian and the origins of the crown group phyla | journal=Phil.

Complementary to the shelly fossil record, trace fossils can be divided into five subdivisions: "Flat world" (late Ediacaran), with traces restricted to the sediment surface; Protreozoic III (after Jensen), with increasing complexity; ''pedum'' world, initiated at the base of the Cambrian with the base of the ''T.pedum'' zone (see discussion at [[Cambrian#Dating the Cambrian]]); ''Rusophycus'' world, spanning {{Ma|536|521}} and thus corresponding exactly to the periods of Sclerite World and Brachiopod World under the SSF paradigm; and ''Cruziana'' world, with an obvious correspondence to Trilobite World.

The fossil record as Darwin knew it seemed to suggest that the major metazoan groups appeared in a few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, and even in the 1980s, this still appeared to be the case.&lt;ref name="Whittington1985BurgessShale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WonderfulLife"/&gt;

Some say that the evolutionary change was accelerated by an [[order of magnitude]],{{refn |group=note |As defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;}} but the presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion; not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their [[evolutionary radiation]] ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought.

Ecological complexity among marine animals increased in the Cambrian, as well later in the Ordovician.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007" /&gt; However, recent research has overthrown the once-popular idea that disparity was exceptionally high throughout the Cambrian, before subsequently decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Erwin, D.H. | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00614.x | title = Disparity: Morphological Pattern And Developmental Context | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, disparity remains relatively low throughout the Cambrian, with modern levels of disparity only attained after the early Ordovician radiation.&lt;ref name="Bambach2007"/&gt;

===The Cambrian explosion as survivorship bias===

[[Graham Budd|Budd]] and Mann&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276-229 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the Cambrian explosion was the result of a type of [[survivorship bias]] called the "[[Push of the past]]". As groups at their origin tend to go extinct, it follows that any long-lived group would have experienced an unusually rapid rate of diversification early on, creating the illusion of a general speed-up in diversification rates. However, rates of diversification could remain at background levels and still generate this sort of effect in the surviving lineages.

==Possible causes==
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals ([[triploblastic]] [[bilateria]]ns) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain both the timing and magnitude of the explosion.

===Changes in the environment===
====Increase in oxygen levels====
[[Earth's atmosphere#Evolution of Earth's atmosphere|Earth's earliest atmosphere]] contained no free [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schirrmeister|first1=B.E.|last2=deVos|first2=J.M|last3=Antonelli|first3=A.|last4=Bagherri|first4=H.C.|title=Evolution of multicellularity coincided with increased diversification of cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=5|pages=1791–1796|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209927110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1791S|pmid=23319632|pmc=3562814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canfield|first1=D.E.|last2=Poulton|first2=S.W.|last3=Narbonne|first3=G.M.|title=Late-Neoproterozoic Deep-Ocean Oxygenation and the Rise of Animal Life|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|doi=10.1126/science.1135013|pmid=17158290|issue=5808|pages=92–5|bibcode=2007Sci...315...92C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a saturation point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekker|first1=A.|last2=Holland|first2=H.D.|last3=Wang|first3=P.I.|last4=Rumble, III|first4=D.|last5=Stein|first5=H.J.|last6=Hannah|first6=J.L.|last7=Coetzee|first7=L.L.|last8=Beukes|first8=H.J.|title=Dating the rise of atmospheric oxygen|journal=Nature|date=2003|volume=427|issue=6970|pages=117–120|doi=10.1038/nature02260|pmid=14712267|bibcode=2004Natur.427..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general trend, the [[concentration]] of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt;

Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in eukaryotes well before the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parfrey|first1=L.W.|last2=Lahr|first2=D.J.G.|last3=Knoll|first3=A.H.|last4=Katz|first4=L.A.|title=Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks|journal=PNAS|date=2011|volume=108|issue=33|pages=13624–13629|doi=10.1073/pnas.1110633108|pmid=21810989|pmc=3158185|bibcode = 2011PNAS..10813624P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around 800 million years ago, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Before the spike in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with mitochondrial function in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to drive metabolism. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion.&lt;ref name="Knoll1999"&gt;e.g. {{cite journal

This may have caused a mass extinction, creating a genetic bottleneck; the resulting diversification may have given rise to the [[Ediacara biota]], which appears soon after the last "Snowball Earth" episode.&lt;ref name="HoffmanKaufman1998NeoproterozoicSnowball"&gt;{{cite journal

However, the snowball episodes occurred a long time before the start of the Cambrian, and it is hard to see how so much diversity could have been caused by even a series of bottlenecks;&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; the cold periods may even have ''delayed'' the evolution of large size organisms.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt;

====Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater====
Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/novel-evolutionary-theory-for-the-explosion-of-life/ Novel Evolutionary Theory For The Explosion Of Life]&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's [[Great Unconformity]].&lt;ref name="Peters2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = S.

An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the [[East African Orogeny|Transgondwanan Supermountain]] that existed at the time the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day [[East Africa]] as an [[orogeny|orogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Developmental explanations===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor [[Evolutionary developmental biology|modifications to animals' development]] as they grow from [[embryo]] to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The [[Hox gene]]s, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain ''Hox'' gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt; combines with molecular data&lt;ref name="deRosa1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Rosa, R. |author2=Grenier, J.K. |author3=Andreeva, T. |author4=Cook, C.E. |author5=Adoutte, A. |author6=Akam, M. |author7=Carroll, S.B. |author8=Balavoine, G. |date=June 1999 | doi = 10.1038/21631 | journal = Nature | volume = 399 |title=Hox genes in brachiopods and priapulids and protostome evolution | pmid = 10391241  | issue = 6738 | issn = 0028-0836 | pages = 772–6|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..772D }}&lt;/ref&gt; to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the [[physics]] of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by [[self-organization]].&lt;ref name="Newman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, S.A.  |author2=Bhat, R. |date=April 2008 | doi = 10.1088/1478-3975/5/1/015008| journal = Physical Biology | volume = 5 | page = 0150580|title=Dynamical patterning modules: physico-genetic determinants of morphological development and evolution | pmid = 18403826  | issue = 1 | issn = 1478-3967|bibcode = 2008PhBio...5a5008N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horizontal gene transfer]] has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Macis|first2=Luciana|last3=Reitner|first3=Joachim|last4=Wörheide|first4=Gert|title=A horizontal gene transfer supported the evolution of an early metazoan biomineralization strategy|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=12 August 2011|volume=11|page=238|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-238|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/238|access-date=10 September 2014|pmid=21838889|pmc=3163562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological explanations===
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the [[food chain]]; some suggest [[Evolutionary arms race|arms races]] between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of [[coevolution]]. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====End-Ediacaran mass extinction====
{{main|End-Ediacaran extinction}}
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as ''Cloudina'', and the accompanying perturbation in the {{d13c|link}} record.

Mass extinctions are often followed by [[adaptive radiation]]s as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining" /&gt;

====Evolution of eyes====
{{main|Evolution of the eye}}
[[Andrew Parker (zoologist)|Andrew Parker]] has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs&amp;nbsp;– smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Parker, Andrew | title=In the Blink of an Eye |publisher= Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | isbn=0-7382-0607-5 | oclc=52074044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name="McCall2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCall | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.08.004 | title = The Vendian (Ediacaran) in the geological record: Enigmas in geology's prelude to the Cambrian explosion | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 77 | pages = 1–229 |bibcode = 2006ESRv...77....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.&lt;ref name="Marshall2006Explaining"/&gt;

====Arms races between predators and prey====
The ability to avoid or recover from [[predation]] often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of [[natural selection]]. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.&lt;ref name="DawkinsKrebs1979ArmsRaces"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Arms races between and within species| volume=205| issue=1161| pages=489–511| date=September 21, 1979| jstor=77442 |author1=Dawkins, R. |author2=Krebs, R.J.| doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081
| journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]| pmid=42057| bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in ''Cloudina'' shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the ''appearance'' of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced.&lt;ref name="Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation"/&gt; However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1988 |author=McMenamin, M. A. S. |title=Palaeocological feedback and the Vendian-Cambrian transition |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=3 |pages=205–208 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(88)90008-0 |pmid=21227202 |issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as new predatory "tactics" (such as shell-crushing) emerged.&lt;ref name="Zhang2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Zhang | first1=Z. | last2=Holmer | first2=L.

Thus the role of predators as triggerers of diversification may have been limited to the very beginning of the "Cambrian explosion".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals====
[[Geochemical]] evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of [[plankton]] has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their [[drag (physics)|drag]] was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by [[scavenger]]s or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens [[Filter feeder|filtered]] microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some [[carbon]] out of [[Carbon cycle|circulation]], resulting in an increase in the [[concentration]] of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily [[Chemical compound|combines]] with oxygen).&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001"/&gt;

The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the [[Ediacaran]] period.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2001ECR"&gt;{{Cite book

Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through [[coevolution]].&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt; This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"/&gt;

===Ecosystem engineering===
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The [[Devonian]] [[Colonization of the land|colonization of land]] had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the [[Devonian extinction|Devonian mass extinction]]. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.&lt;ref name="Erwin2011a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Erwin | first1 = D.

===Complexity threshold===
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.&lt;ref name="SoléFernándezKauffman2003AdaptiveWalks"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genetic threshold may have a correlation to the amount of oxygen available to organisms. Using oxygen for metabolism produces much more energy than anaerobic processes. Organisms that use more oxygen have the opportunity to produce more complex proteins, providing a template for further evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These proteins translate into larger, more complex structures that allow organisms better to adapt to their environments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperling|first1=E.A.|last2=Frieder|first2=C.A.|last3=Raman|first3=A.V.|last4=Girguis|first4=P.R.|last5=Levin|first5=L.A.|last6=Knoll|first6=A.H.|title=Oxygen, ecology, and the Cambrian radiation of animals|journal=PNAS|date=2013|volume=110|issue=33|pages=13446–13451|doi=10.1073/pnas.1312778110|pmid=23898193|bibcode=2013PNAS..11013446S|pmc=3746845}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of oxygen, genes that code for these proteins could contribute to the expression of [[complex traits]] more efficiently. Access to a wider range of structures and functions would allow organisms to evolve in different directions, increasing the number of niches that could be inhabited. Furthermore, organisms had the opportunity to become more specialized in their own niches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Uniqueness of the explosion==
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a [[coevolution]]ary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2007"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Butterfield | first1 = N. J.| year = 2007| title = Macroevolution and macroecology through deep time| journal = Palaeontology| volume = 50| issue = 1| pages = 41–55| doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan [[clade]]s of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiations]], such as those of [[fish]] in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, involved fewer [[taxon|taxa]], mainly with very similar body plans.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Although the recovery from the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic extinction]] started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Erwin |first=D.H. |author2=Valentine, J.W. |author3=Sepkoski, J.J. |date=November 1987| title=A Comparative Study of Diversification Events: The Early Paleozoic Versus the Mesozoic |journal=Evolution |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1177–1186 |doi=10.2307/2409086 |pmid=11542112|jstor=2409086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable [[ecological niche]]s. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and [[wikt:incumbent|incumbent]]s usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different [[phylum|phyla]]; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.&lt;ref name="Valentine1995WhyNoNewPhyla"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Why No New Phyla after the Cambrian?

There were two similar explosions in the [[Evolutionary history of plants#Colonisation of land|evolution of land plants]]: after a cryptic history beginning about {{Ma|450}}, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about {{Ma|400}}.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLife"/&gt; Furthermore, Angiosperms ([[flowering plant]]s) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Effects}}

In [[quantum field theory]], the '''Casimir effect''' and the '''Casimir–Polder force''' are physical [[force (physics)|forces]] arising from a [[quantization (physics)|quantized field]]. They are named after the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Casimir]] who predicted them in 1948.

The Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and [[dielectric]]s alters the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy of the second quantized [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;E.

In modern [[theoretical physics]], the Casimir effect plays an important role in the [[nucleon#Models|chiral bag model]] of the [[nucleon]]; in [[applied physics]], it is significant in some aspects of emerging [[microtechnologies]] and [[nanotechnologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Lambrecht, Serge Reynaud and Cyriaque Genet (2007) "[http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf Casimir In The Nanoworld]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122143950/http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf |date=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==
The typical example is of the two [[electric charge|uncharged]] conductive plates in a [[vacuum]], placed a few nanometers apart. In a [[classical electromagnetism|classical]] description, the lack of an external field means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genet|first1=C.|last2=Intravaia|first2=F.|last3=Lambrecht|first3=A.|last4=Reynaud|first4=S.|date=2004|title=Electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, Casimir and Van der Waals forces|url=http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-291/aflb291p227.pdf|journal=[[Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie]]|volume=29|issue=1–2|pages=311–328|arxiv=quant-ph/0302072|bibcode=2003quant.ph..2072G}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this field is instead studied using the [[QED vacuum|quantum electrodynamic vacuum]], it is seen that the plates do affect the [[virtual particle|virtual photons]] which constitute the field, and generate a net force&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.aps.org/story/v2/st28 The Force of Empty Space], ''[[Physical Review Focus]]'', 3 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of [[virtual particle]]s interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the [[zero-point energy]] of a [[Quantum field theory|quantized field]] in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by [[second quantization]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lambrecht, [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747 The Casimir effect: a force from nothing], ''[[Physics World]]'', September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/pnu/1996/split/pnu300-3.htm American Institute of Physics News Note 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations has led to some controversy. In fact, "Casimir's original goal was to compute the [[van der Waals force]] between [[dipolar polarization|polarizable molecules]]" of the conductive plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) of quantum fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaffe|first1=R.|year=2005|title=Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=72|issue=2|pages=021301|arxiv=hep-th/0503158|bibcode=2005PhRvD..72b1301J|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicron scale, this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors. In fact, at separations of 10&amp;nbsp;nm &amp;ndash; about 100&amp;nbsp;times the typical size of an atom &amp;ndash; the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of about 1&amp;nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere of pressure]] (the precise value depending on surface geometry and other factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747|title=The Casimir effect: a force from nothing|date=1 September 2002|work=[[Physics World]]|accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicists Hendrik Casimir and [[Dirk Polder]] at [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips Research Labs]] proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947; this special form is called the '''Casimir–Polder force'''. After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]], who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the '''Casimir effect''' in the narrow sense.

Predictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics, and recent calculations have considered more general geometries. Experiments before 1997 had observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of [[liquid helium]] films. However it was not until 1997 that a direct experiment by S. Lamoreaux quantitatively measured the force to within 5% of the value predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Lamoureaux1997 /&gt; Subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent.

==Possible causes==
===Vacuum energy===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Faster-than-light]] --&gt;
{{Quantum field theory}}
{{Main article|Vacuum energy}}
The causes of the Casimir effect are described by [[quantum field theory]], which states that all of the various fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a "field" in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], and its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. However, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: [[spin (physics)|spin]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], [[energy]], and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, "empty" in this sense. One important exception is the [[vacuum energy]] or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or [[zero-point energy]] that such an oscillator may have is

:&lt;math&gt;{E}=\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \hbar \omega \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only ''differences'' in energy are physically measurable (with the notable exception of gravitation, which remains [[Quantum gravity#Nonrenormalizability of gravity|beyond the scope of quantum field theory]]), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a [[Renormalization#Attitudes and interpretation|cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists]] before the development in the 1970s of the [[renormalization group]], a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.

When the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity, the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently [[Cosmological constant problem|no compelling explanation]] as to why it should not result in a [[cosmological constant]] that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed.&lt;ref name=Rugh&gt;

The Casimir effect for [[fermion]]s can be understood as the [[spectral asymmetry]] of the [[(−1)F|fermion operator]] &lt;math&gt;(-1)^F&lt;/math&gt;, where it is known as the [[Witten index]].

===Relativistic van der Waals force===
Alternatively, a 2005 paper by [[Robert Jaffe]] of MIT states that "Casimir effects
can be formulated and Casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies. They are relativistic, quantum forces between charges and currents. The Casimir force (per unit
area) between parallel plates vanishes as alpha, the fine structure constant, goes to zero, and the standard result, which appears to be independent of alpha, corresponds to the alpha approaching infinity limit," and that "The Casimir force is simply the (relativistic, [[retarded potential|retarded]]) [[van der Waals force]] between the metal plates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Casimir Effect and the Quantum Vacuum |author=R.L.Jaffe |year=2005 |arxiv=hep-th/0503158v1 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301 |volume=72 |journal=Physical Review D |bibcode=2005PhRvD..72b1301J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casimir and Polder's original paper used this method to derive the Casimir-Polder force. In 1978, Schwinger, DeRadd, and Milton published a similar derivation for the Casimir Effect between two parallel plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwinger | first1 = Julian | last2 = DeRaad | first2 = Lester L. | last3 = Milton | first3 = Kimball A. | year = 1978 | title = Casimir effect in dielectrics | url = | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0|bibcode = 1978AnPhy.115....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the description in terms of van der Waals forces is the only correct description from the fundamental microscopic perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Hrvoje|date=2016-10-10|title=Proof that Casimir force does not originate from vacuum energy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269316304567|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=761|pages=197–202|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.08.036|bibcode=2016PhLB..761..197N|arxiv = 1605.04143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Hrvoje|date=August 2017|title=Is zero-point energy physical?

==Effects==
Casimir's observation was that the [[Canonical quantization|second-quantized]] quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or [[dielectric]]s, must obey the same [[Boundary value problem|boundary condition]]s that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or dielectric.

Consider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a [[Cavity magnetron|radar cavity]] or a [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]. In this case, the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the [[standing wave]]s of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the ''n''th standing wave is &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum running over all possible values of ''n'' enumerating the standing waves. The factor of 1/2 is present because the zero-point energy of the n'th mode is &lt;math&gt;E_n/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is the energy increment for the n'th mode. (It is the same 1/2 as appears in the equation &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar \omega/2&lt;/math&gt;.) Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.

In particular, one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape ''s'' of the cavity. Each energy level &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; depends on the shape, and so one should write &lt;math&gt;E_n(s)&lt;/math&gt; for the energy level, and &lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: the force at point ''p'' on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape ''s'' of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by &lt;math&gt;\delta s&lt;/math&gt;, at point ''p''. That is, one has

:&lt;math&gt;F(p)=- \left. \frac{\delta \langle E(s) \rangle} {\delta s} \right\vert_p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This value is finite in many practical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief summary, see the introduction in {{cite journal |last1=Passante |first1=R. |last2=Spagnolo |first2=S. |title=Casimir-Polder interatomic potential between two atoms at finite temperature and in the presence of boundary conditions |arxiv=0708.2240 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=76 |pages=042112 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042112 |issue=4 |bibcode=2007PhRvA..76d2112P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). With ''a'' &lt;&lt; ''L'', the states within the slot of width ''a'' are highly constrained so that the energy ''E'' of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region ''L'', where there is a large number (numbering about ''L'' / ''a'') of states with energy evenly spaced between ''E'' and the next mode in the narrow slot &amp;ndash; in other words, all slightly larger than ''E''. Now on shortening ''a'' by d''a'' (&lt; 0), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to &amp;minus;d''a''/''a'', whereas all the ''L'' /''a'' states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to d''a''/''L'' (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the ''L''/''a'' modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make ''a'' slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.

==Derivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization==
* ''See '''[[v:Quantum mechanics/Casimir effect in one dimension|Wikiversity]]''' for an elementary calculation in one dimension.''

In the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the plates lie parallel to the ''xy''-plane, the standing waves are

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,y,z;t)=e^{-i\omega_nt} e^{ik_xx+ik_yy} \sin(k_n z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[wave number]]s in directions parallel to the plates, and

:&lt;math&gt;k_n=\frac{n\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

is the wave-number perpendicular to the plates. Here, ''n'' is an integer, resulting from the requirement that ψ vanish on the metal plates. The frequency of this wave is

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n=c \sqrt{{k_x}^2 + {k_y}^2 + \frac{n^2\pi^2}{a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes. Since the area of the plates is large, we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in ''k''-space. The assumption of [[Van Hove singularity#Theory|periodic boundary conditions]] yields,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle=\frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2
\int \frac{A dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The [[Zeta function regularization|zeta-regulated]] version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=\hbar
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n
\vert \omega_n\vert^{-s}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the end, the limit &lt;math&gt;s\to 0&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken. Here ''s'' is just a [[complex number]], not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral/sum is finite for ''s'' [[real number|real]] and larger than 3. The sum has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''s''=3, but may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s''=0, where the expression is finite. The above expression simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
\frac{\hbar c^{1-s}}{4\pi^2} \sum_n \int_0^\infty 2\pi qdq
\left \vert q^2 + \frac{\pi^2 n^2}{a^2} \right\vert^{(1-s)/2},&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;q^2=k_x^2+k_y^2&lt;/math&gt; were introduced to turn the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] into a single integral. The &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; in front is the Jacobian, and the &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; comes from the angular integration. The integral converges if Re[''s''] &gt; 3, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}} \frac{1}{3-s}
\sum_n \vert n\vert ^{3-s}=
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}}\sum_n \frac{1}{\left| n\right| ^{s-3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum diverges at ''s'' in the neighborhood of zero, but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to ''s''=0 is assumed to make sense physically in some way, then one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A}=
\lim_{s\to 0} \frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^{2}}{6a^{3}} \zeta (-3).&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(-3)=\frac {1} {120}&lt;/math&gt;

and so one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A}=
\frac {-\hbar c \pi^{2}}{720 a^{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity, somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy (not included above) outside the slot between the plates, but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system. The Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is

:&lt;math&gt;{F_c \over A}=-\frac{d}{da} \frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = -\frac {\hbar c \pi^2} {240 a^4}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (hbar, ħ) is the [[reduced Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance]] between the two plates

The force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; shows that the Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.

NOTE: In Casimir's original derivation [http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf], a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). The 0-point energy on ''both'' sides of the plate is considered. Instead of the above ''ad hoc'' analytic continuation assumption, non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using [[Euler–Maclaurin summation]] with a regularizing function (e.g., exponential regularization) not so anomalous as &lt;math&gt;\vert\omega_n\vert^{-s}&lt;/math&gt; in the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruggiero |first1=Zimerman |last2=Villani |title=Application of Analytic Regularization to the Casimir Forces |journal=Revista Brasileira de Física |volume=7 |number=3 |year=1977 |url=http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/download/v07/v07a43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent theory===
Casimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E M |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=Lev P |title=GENERAL THEORY OF VAN DER WAALS' FORCES |journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi |volume=4 |pages=153 |year=1961 |doi=10.1070/PU1961v004n02ABEH003330 |issue=2 |bibcode=1961SvPhU...4..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Kats |first2=E I |title=Casimir forces in modulated systems |arxiv=cond-mat/0408348 |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |volume=16 |pages=5659 |year=2004 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/16/32/003 |issue=32 |bibcode=2004JPCM...16.5659D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials. Lifshitz's theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir's idealized 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; force law for large separations ''a'' much greater than the [[skin depth]] of the metal, and conversely reduces to the 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force law of the [[London dispersion force]] (with a coefficient called a [[Hamaker constant]]) for small ''a'', with a more complicated dependence on ''a'' for intermediate separations determined by the [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Parsegian, ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifshitz' result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials, but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt; For example, the force in the experimental sphere–plate geometry was computed with an approximation (due to Derjaguin) that the sphere radius ''R'' is much larger than the separation ''a'', in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate ''R''/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force (neglecting both skin-depth and [[Orders of approximation|higher-order]] curvature effects).&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. V. Derjaguin, I. I. Abrikosova, and E. M. Lifshitz, ''Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society'', vol. 10, 295–329 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 2000s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical [[computational electromagnetics]], that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

==Measurement==
{{refimprove science |section |date=July 2015}}
One of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Sparnaay at Philips in [[w:Eindhoven|Eindhoven]] (Netherlands), in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates, obtaining results not in contradiction with the Casimir theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sparnaay |first1=M. J. |title=Attractive Forces between Flat Plates |journal=Nature |volume=180 |pages=334 |year=1957 |doi=10.1038/180334b0 |issue=4581 |bibcode=1957Natur.180..334S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sparnaay |first1=M |title=Measurements of attractive forces between flat plates |journal=Physica |volume=24 |pages=751 |year=1958 |doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(58)80090-7 |issue=6–10 |bibcode=1958Phy....24..751S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with large experimental errors. Some of the experimental details as well as some background information on how Casimir, Polder and Sparnaay arrived at this point&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draschan.com/gallery/casimir-sparnaay-werner.mov Movie]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are highlighted in a 2007 interview with Marcus Sparnaay.

The Casimir effect was measured more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]],&lt;ref name=Lamoureaux1997&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamoreaux |first1=S. K. |title=Demonstration of the Casimir Force in the 0.6 to 6 μm Range |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=78 |pages=5 |year=1997 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5 |bibcode=1997PhRvL..78....5L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the [[University of California, Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.4549 |last1=Mohideen |first1=U. |year=1998 |pages=4549 |volume=81 |journal=Physical Review Letters |last2=Roy |first2=Anushree |title=Precision Measurement of the Casimir Force from 0.1 to 0.9 µm |issue=21 |arxiv=physics/9805038 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.4549M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a [[sphere]] with a large [[radius]].

In 2001, a group (Giacomo Bressi, Gianni Carugno, Roberto Onofrio and Giuseppe Ruoso) at the [[University of Padua|University of Padua (Italy)]] finally succeeded in measuring the Casimir force between parallel plates using [[Microelectromechanical system oscillator#Resonators|microresonators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bressi |first1=G. |last2=Carugno |first2=G. |last3=Onofrio |first3=R. |last4=Ruoso |first4=G. |title=Measurement of the Casimir Force between Parallel Metallic Surfaces |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |pages=041804 |year=2002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.041804 |issue=4 |pmid=11801108 |arxiv=quant-ph/0203002 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..88d1804B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regularisation==
In order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] in the summations. This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.

The [[heat kernel regularization|heat kernel]] or [[Exponential function|exponentially]] regulated sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n |
\exp (-t |\omega_n |)&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit &lt;math&gt;t\to 0^+&lt;/math&gt; is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{C}{t^3} + \textrm{finite}\,&lt;/math&gt;

for three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant ''C'' which ''does not'' depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] regulator

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n |
\exp (-t^2 |\omega_n |^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The [[zeta function regulator]]

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n | |\omega_n |^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

is completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the [[complex plane|complex ''s'' plane]], with the bulk divergence at ''s''=4. This sum may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] past this pole, to obtain a finite part at ''s''=0.

Not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ''s''=0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the [[plasma frequency]]), metals become transparent to [[photon]]s (such as [[X-ray]]s), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in [[solid state physics]], mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the [[cutoff frequency]] comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in ''Landau and Lifshitz'', "Theory of Continuous Media".)

==Generalities==
The Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of [[functional integral]]s of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called "[[virtual particle]]s".

More interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the [[van der Waals force]], to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.

In the [[chiral bag model]] of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the [[spectral asymmetry]] is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[baryon number]], cancelling the [[topological winding number]] of the [[pion]] field surrounding the nucleon.

==Dynamical Casimir effect==
The dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated ''moving mirror''. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to [[quantum mechanics]] equations made in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulling |first1=S. A. |last2=Davies |first2=P. C. W. |title=Radiation from a Moving Mirror in Two Dimensional Space-Time: Conformal Anomaly |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=348 |pages=393 |year=1976 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1976.0045 |issue=1654 |bibcode=1976RSPSA.348..393F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 an announcement was made by researchers at the [[Chalmers University of Technology]], in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified [[SQUID]] to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required [[Speed of light|relativistic]] velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26813/ |title=First Observation of the Dynamical Casimir Effect |publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogies===
A similar analysis can be used to explain [[Hawking radiation]] that causes the slow "[[Hawking radiation#Black hole evaporation|evaporation]]" of [[black hole]]s (although this is generally visualized as the escape of one particle from a [[virtual particle]]-[[antiparticle]] pair, the other particle having been captured by the black hole).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sundermier|first1=Ali|title=Evidence of Stephen Hawking's famous prediction about black holes was just observed for the first time|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-hawkings-prediction-about-black-holes-was-just-observed-for-the-first-time-2016-8|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=Business Insider|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed within the framework of [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]], the dynamical Casimir effect has been used to better understand acceleration radiation such as the [[Unruh effect]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Repulsive forces==
There are few instances wherein the Casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects. [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise.&lt;ref name=DLP&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I.E. |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E.M. |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=L.P. |title=The general theory of van der Waals forces† |journal=Advances in Physics |volume=10 |pages=165 |year=1961 |doi=10.1080/00018736100101281 |issue=38 |bibcode=1961AdPhy..10..165D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz was carried out by Munday et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munday |first1=J.N. |last2=Capasso |first2=F. |last3=Parsegian |first3=V.A. |title=Measured long-range repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz forces |journal=Nature |volume=457 |pages=170–3 |year=2009 |doi=10.1038/nature07610 |pmid=19129843 |issue=7226 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..170M |pmc=4169270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have also suggested the use of [[gain media]] to achieve a similar levitation effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1559579/Physicists-have-%27solved%27-mystery-of-levitation.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Physicists have 'solved' mystery of levitation |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium ([[Kramers–Kronig relations]]). Casimir and Casimir-Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milton |first1=K.

The Casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, and it has been shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be ''arbitrarily'' negative at a given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicists such as [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html |title=Space and Time Warps |publisher=Hawking.org.uk |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kip Thorne]],&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf |pmid=10038800 |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sopova |author2=Ford |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.045026 |title=The Energy Density in the Casimir Effect |year=2002 |volume=66 |issue=4 |page=045026 |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |arxiv=quant-ph/0204125 |bibcode=2002PhRvD..66d5026S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ford |author2=Roman |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.4277 |year=1995 |title=Averaged Energy Conditions and Quantum Inequalities |pages=4277–4286 |issue=8 |volume=51 |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |arxiv=gr-qc/9410043 |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.4277F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3567 |author1=Olum |title=Superluminal travel requires negative energies |year=1998 |volume=81 |issue=17 |pages=3567–3570 |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |arxiv=gr-qc/9805003 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.3567O }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].

'''Cavitation''' is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid, small liquid-free zones ("bubbles" or "voids"), that are the consequence of forces acting upon the liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of [[pressure]] that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense [[shock wave]].

Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some [[engineering]] contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called "cavitation". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.

Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.

Since the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].

== Physics ==

Inertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.

Other ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233–252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.

The physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation "bubbles" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.

The vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].

Non-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.

==Hydrodynamic cavitation==
Hydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.

The process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Orifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641–1648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and supercavitation were published in the book ''Jets, wakes and cavities''&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff, G, Zarantonello. E (1957) Jets, wakes and cavities. New York: Academic Press.  406p.&lt;/ref&gt;  followed by ''Theory of jets of ideal fluid''.&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, MI (1978) Theory of jets of ideal fluid.  Nauka, Moscow, 536p. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems. Another venue combining the existing exact solutions with approximated and heuristic models was explored in the work ''Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries''&lt;ref&gt;Logvinovich, GV (1969) Hydrodynamics of Flows with Free Boundaries. Naukova dumka, Kiev, 215p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;  that refined the applied calculation techniques based on the principle of cavity expansion independence, theory of pulsations and stability of elongated axisymmetric cavities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, RT, Daili, JW, Hammit, FG (1970) Cavitation. New York: Mc Graw Hill Book Company.  578p.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;Epshtein, LA (1970) Dimensionality and similarity methods in the problems of the hydromechanics of vessels. Sudostroyenie , Leningrad, 208p. (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

A natural continuation of these studies was recently presented in ''The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows''&lt;ref&gt;Terentiev, A, Kirschner, I, Uhlman, J, (2011) The Hydrodynamics of Cavitating Flows. Backbone Publishing Company, 598pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  – an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain for the last three decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.

Hydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P. R. |last2=Kabadi |first2=A. M. |year=2009 |title=A review of applications of cavitation in biochemical engineering/biotechnology |journal=Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=60–72 |doi=10.1016/j.bej.2008.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Chemical engineering===
In industry, cavitation is often used to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenize]], or mix and break down, suspended particles in a [[colloidal]] liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).

Cavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].

Use of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. --&gt;

Hydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together. This effect may assist in [[protein folding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2006/snap.html | website = Sandia National Laboratories | date = 2006-08-02 | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | title = Sandia researchers solve mystery of attractive surfaces }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavitation plays an important role for the destruction of [[kidney stone]]s in [[extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|shock wave lithotripsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 2442573|year = 2003|last1 = Pishchalnikov|first1 = Y.

Nitrogen cavitation is a method used in research to [[lysis|lyse]] cell membranes while leaving organelles intact.

Cavitation plays a key role in non-thermal, non-invasive fractionation of tissue for treatment of a variety of diseases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histotripsy.umich.edu/ University of Michigan. ''Therapeutic Ultrasound Group, Biomedical Engineering Department, University of Michigan''.]&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to open the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]] to increase uptake of neurological drugs in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33264 | doi=10.1038/srep33264| pmid=27630037| pmc=5024096| title=Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Opening: Association with Mechanical Index and Cavitation Index Analyzed by Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic-Resonance Imaging| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=6| pages=33264| year=2016| last1=Chu| first1=Po-Chun| last2=Chai| first2=Wen-Yen| last3=Tsai| first3=Chih-Hung| last4=Kang| first4=Shih-Tsung| last5=Yeh| first5=Chih-Kuang| last6=Liu| first6=Hao-Li}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavitation also plays a role in [[HIFU]], a thermal non-invasive treatment methodology for [[cancer]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Old citation was for a research group at a University and it not appropriate|date=August 2018}}

Ultrasound sometimes is used to increase bone formation, for instance in post-surgical applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physiomontreal.com/Ultrasound.pdf PhysioMontreal Article "Ultrasound".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultrasound treatments or exposure can create cavitation that potentially may "result in a syndrome involving manifestations of nausea, headache, tinnitus, pain, dizziness, and fatigue.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php Health Canada "Guidelines for the Safe Use of Ultrasound: Part II – Industrial &amp; Commercial Applications – Safety Code 24"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110213842/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/radiation/safety-code_24-securite/health-sante-eng.php |date=January 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the sound of [[cracking joints|"cracking" knuckles]] derives from the collapse of cavitation in the synovial fluid within the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=A|author2=Dowson, D|author3=Wright, V|title='Cracking joints'. A bioengineering study of cavitation in the metacarpophalangeal joint|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|date=July 1971|volume=30|issue=4|pages=348–58|pmid=5557778|doi=10.1136/ard.30.4.348|pmc=1005793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movements that cause cracking expand the joint space, thus reducing pressure to the point of cavitation. It remains controversial whether this is associated with clinically significant joint injury such as osteoarthritis. Some physicians say that osteoarthritis is caused by cracking knuckles regularly, as this causes wear and tear and may cause the bone to weaken. The implication being that, it is not the "bubbles popping," but rather, the bones rubbing together, that causes osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deweber|first=K|author2=Olszewski, M|author3=Ortolano, R|title=Knuckle cracking and hand osteoarthritis|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM|date=Mar–Apr 2011|volume=24|issue=2|pages=169–74|pmid=21383216|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2011.02.100156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
In industrial cleaning applications, cavitation has sufficient power to overcome the particle-to-substrate adhesion forces, loosening contaminants. The threshold pressure required to initiate cavitation is a strong function of the pulse width and the power input. This method works by generating controlled acoustic cavitation in the cleaning fluid, picking up and carrying contaminant particles away so that they do not reattach to the material being cleaned.

=== Food and beverage ===

==== Eggs ====
Cavitation has been applied to egg pasteurization. A hole-filled rotor produces cavitation bubbles, heating the liquid from within. Equipment surfaces stay cooler than the passing liquid, so eggs don't harden as they did on the hot surfaces of older equipment. The intensity of cavitation can be adjusted, making it possible to tune the process for minimum protein damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/12/11/569467444/how-the-food-industry-uses-cavitation-the-oceans-most-powerful-punch|title=How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cavitation damage{{anchor|Cavitation erosion}}==
[[Image:Turbine Francis Worn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cavitation damage to a [[Francis turbine]].]]

Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A. C. |first=Masters I. |doi=10.1177/0957650913477093 |year=2013 |title=Cavitation inception and simulation in blade element momentum theory for modelling tidal stream turbines |journal=Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part A: Journal of Power and Energy |volume=227 |issue=4 |pages=479–485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].

Although the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.

After a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumps and propellers===
Major places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.

As an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.

Cavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:

====Suction cavitation====
[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.

Common causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.

====Discharge cavitation====
Discharge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.

Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.

====Cavitation solutions====
Since all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.

To have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pulp &amp; Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes&lt;/ref&gt;
To overcome cavitation:
Increase suction pressure if possible.
Decrease liquid temperature if possible.
Throttle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.
Vent gases off the pump casing.

===Control valves===

Cavitation can occur in [[control valves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136&lt;/ref&gt;  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.

===Spillways===
When water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.

Experimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&amp;nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&amp;nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.&lt;ref name="Volkart_Rutschmann_1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors – A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc. Intl. Symp. on Scale Effects in Modelling Hydraulic Structures, IAHR, Esslingen, Germany, H. KOBUS editor, paper 4.5 |year=1984 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When some air is present in the water the resulting mixture is compressible and this damps the high pressure caused
by the bubble collapses.&lt;ref name="Peterka_1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterka, A.J. |title= The Effect of Entrained Air on Cavitation Pitting."

Although these have been installed for some years, the mechanisms of air entrainment at the aerators and the slow movement of the air away from the spillway surface are still challenging.&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989a"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Study of Air Entrainment and Aeration Devices, Journal of Hydraulic Research, IAHR, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 301–319 (ISSN 0022-1686)  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view.php?pid=UQ:9385 |year=1989 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chanson_1989b"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]] |title=Flow downstream of an Aerator.

The spillway aeration device design is based upon a small deflection of the spillway bed (or sidewall) such as a ramp and offset to deflect the high flow velocity flow away from the spillway surface. In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.

===Engines===
Some larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.

It is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.

From about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.

===Geology===
Some hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation—namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.

The loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat. Rising magma, filled with dissolved gasses and under immense pressure, encountered a different magma that compressed easily, allowing bubbles to grow and combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/hvo_volcano_watch.html|title=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory|last=Program|first=Volcano Hazards|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.

===Vascular plants===
Cavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&amp;nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.&lt;ref&gt;Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., &amp; Tyree, M.T., 1996. New evidence for large negative xylem pressures and their measurement by the pressure chamber technique. 'Plant Cell Environ.' 19: 427–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine life===
Just as cavitation bubbles form on a fast-spinning boat propeller, they may also form on the tails and fins of aquatic animals. This primarily occurs near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is low.

Cavitation may limit the maximum swimming speed of powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brahic | first = Catherine | title = Dolphins swim so fast it hurts   | publisher = New Scientist | date = 2008-03-28 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn13553-dolphins-swim-so-fast-it-hurts.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are painful. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings and do not feel pain from cavitation. They are slowed down when cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name="IosilevskiiWeihs2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=20|year=2008|pages=329–338|issn=1742-5689|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|pmid=17580289|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea animals have found ways to use cavitation to their advantage when hunting prey. The [[pistol shrimp]] snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The [[mantis shrimp]] (of the ''smasher'' variety) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patek|first=Sheila|title=Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sheila_patek_clocks_the_fastest_animals.html|publisher=TED|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal erosion===
In the last half-decade, coastal erosion in the form of inertial cavitation has been generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Geomorphology |last=Panizza |first=Mario  |year=1996 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam; New York |isbn=978-0-444-89830-2 |pages=112–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bubbles in an incoming wave are forced into cracks in the cliff being eroded. Varying pressure decompresses some vapor pockets which subsequently implode. The resulting pressure peaks can blast apart fractions of the rock.

'''Chemical vapor deposition''' ('''CVD''') is a deposition method used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials, typically under [[Vacuum deposition|vacuum]]. The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s.

In typical CVD, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[Single crystal|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|dioxide]], [[silicon carbide|carbide]], [[silicon nitride|nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]]), carbon ([[carbon (fiber)|fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]], [[carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[Synthetic diamond|diamond]] and [[graphene]]), [[fluorocarbon]]s, [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium nitride]] and various [[high-k dielectric]]s.

[[File:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|Plasma assisted CVD]]

CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.
* Classified by operating conditions:
** ''Atmospheric pressure CVD'' (APCVD) – CVD at atmospheric pressure.
** ''Low-pressure CVD'' (LPCVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystec.com/klllpcvde.htm|title=Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment|publisher=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer.
** ''Ultrahigh vacuum CVD'' (UHVCVD) – CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and [[ultra-high vacuum]] is common, often 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

Most modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
* Classified by physical characteristics of vapor:
** ''Aerosol assisted CVD'' (AACVD) – CVD in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
** ''Direct liquid injection CVD'' (DLICVD) – CVD in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). The precursor vapors are then transported to the substrate as in classical CVD. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
* Classified by type of substrate heating:
** Hot wall CVD – CVD in which the chamber is heated by an external power source and the substrate is heated by radiation from the heated chamber walls.
** Cold wall CVD – CVD in which only the substrate is directly heated either by induction or by passing current through the substrate itself or a heater in contact with the substrate. The chamber walls are at room temperature.
* Plasma methods (see also [[Plasma processing]]):
** ''Microwave plasma-assisted CVD'' (MPCVD)
** ''[[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma-Enhanced CVD]]'' (PECVD) – CVD that utilizes [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crystec.com/tridepe.htm|title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. The lower temperatures also allow for the deposition of organic coatings, such as plasma polymers, that have been used for nanoparticle surface functionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tavares|first=Jason|author2=Swanson, E.J. |author3=Coulombe, S. |title=Plasma Synthesis of Coated Metal Nanoparticles with Surface Properties Tailored for Dispersion|journal=Plasma Processes and Polymers|year=2008|volume=5|issue=8|page=759|doi=10.1002/ppap.200800074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Remote plasma-enhanced CVD'' (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
* ''Atomic-layer CVD'' ([[ALCVD]]) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, [[crystal]]line films. See [[Atomic layer epitaxy]].
* ''[[Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (CCVD) – Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition or flame pyrolysis is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.

== Uses ==
CVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways  that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist.  [[Gallium arsenide]] is used in some [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and  photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices.  Certain [[carbide]]s and [[nitride]]s confer wear-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wahl, Georg ''et al.''

==Commercially important materials prepared by CVD==

=== Polysilicon ===
[[Polycrystalline silicon]] is deposited from [[trichlorosilane]] (SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following reactions:&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Simmler, W. | title = Silicon Compounds, Inorganic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% [[nitrogen]]. Temperatures between 600 and 650&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050&amp;nbsp;°C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

=== Silicon dioxide ===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply "oxide" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include [[silane]] and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Third World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo, p. 290 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The reactions are as follows:&lt;ref name="cao:2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cao|first1=Guozhong|last2=Wang|first2=Ying|title=Nanostructures and Nanomaterials -- Synthesis, Properties and Applications|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-981-4322-50-8|page=248|doi=10.1142/7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

:Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C, dichlorosilane at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C, and TEOS between 650 and 750&amp;nbsp;°C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or "[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] ("P-glass") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850&amp;nbsp;°C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500&amp;nbsp;°C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

==== Silicon nitride ====
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[ohm|Ω]]·cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = Sze, S.M. | publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =978-81-265-1681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metals ===
CVD for [[tungsten]] is achieved from [[tungsten hexafluoride]] (WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

Other metals, notably aluminium and [[copper]], can be deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu([[hexafluoroacetylacetone|hfac]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Copper is typically deposited by [[electroplating]]. Aluminum can be deposited from [[triisobutylaluminium]] (TIBAL) and related [[organoaluminium compound]]s.

CVD for [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], nickel is widely used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These metals can form useful [[silicide]]s when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal ''M'', the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 M + 10 HCl

whereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:

:M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; → M + n CO

the decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.

[[Niobium(V) oxide]] layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of [[niobium(V) ethoxide]] with the loss of [[diethyl ether]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the equation:

:2 Nb(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Graphene ===
Many variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.
* Carbon source
The most popular carbon source used to produce graphene is methane gas. Less popular choices include petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of three-dimensional graphene from petroleum asphalt by chemical vapor deposition|journal = Materials Letters|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 285–288|volume = 122|doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2014.02.077|first = Zhuchen|last = Liu|first2 = Zhiqiang|last2 = Tu|first3 = Yongfeng|last3 = Li|first4 = Fan|last4 = Yang|first5 = Shuang|last5 = Han|first6 = Wang|last6 = Yang|first7 = Liqiang|last7 = Zhang|first8 = Gang|last8 = Wang|first9 = Chunming|last9 = Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of catalyst
The use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Novel synthesis route to graphene using iron nanoparticles|journal = Journal of Materials Research|date = 2014|pages = 1522–1527|volume = 29|issue = 14|doi = 10.1557/jmr.2014.165|first = Rajen B.|last = Patel|first2 = Chi|last2 = Yu|first3 = Tsengming|last3 = Chou|first4 = Zafar|last4 = Iqbal|bibcode = 2014JMatR..29.1522P}}&lt;/ref&gt; or situated at some distance away at the deposition area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct synthesis of large area graphene on insulating substrate by gallium vapor-assisted chemical vapor deposition|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2015|pages = 093112|volume = 106|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4914114|first = Katsuhisa|last = Murakami|first2 = Shunsuke|last2 = Tanaka|first3 = Ayaka|last3 = Hirukawa|first4 = Takaki|last4 = Hiyama|first5 = Tomoya|last5 = Kuwajima|first6 = Emi|last6 = Kano|first7 = Masaki|last7 = Takeguchi|first8 = Jun-ichi|last8 = Fujita|bibcode = 2015ApPhL.106i3112M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Combining the advantages of both catalytic CVD and the ultra-flat dielectric substrate, gaseous catalyst-assisted CVD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silane-catalysed fast growth of large single-crystalline graphene on hexagonal boron nitride |journal=Nature Communications  |volume=6  |year=2015|page=6499|doi=10.1038/ncomms7499 |pmid=25757864  |pmc=4382696  |last1=Tang |first1=Shujie |last2=Wang |first2=Haomin|last3=Wang |first3=Huishan |arxiv=1503.02806|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6499T}}&lt;/ref&gt; paves the way for synthesizing high-quality graphene for device applications while avoiding the transfer process.
* Physical conditions
Physical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.

Most systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CVD synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene using urea|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy|date = 2015-09-05|pages = 1–6|volume = 58|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s11433-015-5717-0|first = CanKun|last = Zhang|first2 = WeiYi|last2 = Lin|first3 = ZhiJuan|last3 = Zhao|first4 = PingPing|last4 = Zhuang|first5 = LinJie|last5 = Zhan|first6 = YingHui|last6 = Zhou|first7 = WeiWei|last7 = Cai|bibcode = 2015SCPMA..58.7801Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of CVD-graphene on rapidly heated copper foils|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3nr06434d|journal = Nanoscale|volume = 6|issue = 9|pages = 4728–34|doi = 10.1039/c3nr06434d|pmid = 24658264|first = Sang-Min|last = Kim|first2 = Jae-Hyun|last2 = Kim|first3 = Kwang-Seop|last3 = Kim|first4 = Yun|last4 = Hwangbo|first5 = Jong-Hyuk|last5 = Yoon|first6 = Eun-Kyu|last6 = Lee|first7 = Jaechul|last7 = Ryu|first8 = Hak-Joo|last8 = Lee|first9 = Seungmin|last9 = Cho|bibcode = 2014Nanos...6.4728K|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some still use APCVD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.

On the other hand, temperatures used range from 800–1050&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.
* Carrier gas
Hydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.
* Chamber material
Standard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.
* Methods of analysis of results
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.

Sometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Nucleation and growth of single layer graphene on electrodeposited Cu by cold wall chemical vapor deposition|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=28|issue=10|pages=105601|doi=10.1088/1361-6528/aa593b|pmid=28084218|bibcode=2017Nanot..28j5601D|year=2017|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895408/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Pre-coalescence scaling of graphene island sizes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=28 May 2018|volume=123|issue=20|pages=205306|doi=10.1063/1.5021341|bibcode=2018JAP...123t5306D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphene nanoribbon===
In spite of graphene's exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.

=== Diamond ===
[[File:Single-crystal CVD diamond disc.jpg|thumb|Free-standing single-crystal CVD diamond disc]]
[[File:Apollo synthetic diamond.jpg|thumb|alt=A colorless faceted gem|Colorless gem cut from diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition]]
{{See also|Synthetic diamond#Chemical vapor deposition}}
CVD can be used to produce a [[synthetic diamond]] by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1–27 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]]; 0.145–3.926 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]; 7.5–203 [[Torr]])  and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include [[hot filament]], [[microwave]] power, and [[Electric arc|arc discharges]], among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.

Using CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) diameter have been achieved and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.

The growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink.&lt;ref name="poly1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0925-9635(94)90108-2|title=Diamond protective coatings for optical components|year=1994|last1=Costello|first1=M|last2=Tossell|first2=D|last3=Reece|first3=D|last4=Brierley|first4=C|last5=Savage|first5=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|bibcode = 1994DRM.....3.1137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heat2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2005.05.008|title=Comparative study of thermally conductive fillers in underfill for the electronic components|year=2005|last1=Sun Lee|first1=Woong|last2=Yu|first2=Jin|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1647–1653|bibcode = 2005DRM....14.1647S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate.  Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than [[Pyrex]] glass, a [[coefficient of friction]] close to that of Teflon ([[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) and strong [[lipophilicity]] would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.

CVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word "diamond" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp3-bonded]] carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters—especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma—many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single crystal diamond can be made containing various [[dopant]]s.&lt;ref name="single"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2003.10.017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223368741|title=Single crystal diamond for electronic applications|year=2004|last1=Isberg|first1=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=320–324|bibcode = 2004DRM....13..320I }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic diamond#Crystallinity|Polycrystalline diamond]] consisting of grain sizes from several [[nanometer]]s to several [[micrometre|micrometers]] can be grown.&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(01)00385-5|title=Ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films for MEMS and moving mechanical assembly devices|year=2001|last1=Krauss|first1=A|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1952–1961|bibcode = 2001DRM....10.1952K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond's hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 5630–5634 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200501311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Complex (chemistry)#Optical isomerism|l1=Complex (chemistry): Isomerism}}
Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

[[File:Cob wall mud construction.jpg|upright|thumb|Building a wall out of cob.]]
'''Cob''',  '''cobb''' or '''clom''' (in Wales) is a [[natural building]] material made from [[subsoil]], water, fibrous [[organic material]] (typically [[straw]]), and sometimes [[Lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Joseph. "COB(B, sb3. 1.", ''The English Dialect Dictionary, Being the Complete Vocabulary of All Dialect Words Still in Use, or Known to Have Been in Use during the Last Two Hundred Years''. London: H. Frowde;, 1898. 676-677. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of subsoil naturally vary, and if it does not contain the right mixture it can be modified with sand or clay. Cob is fireproof, resistant to seismic activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodnow|first=Cecelia|title=Thinking of building a cob home?|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Thinking-of-building-a-cob-home-1251753.php|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inexpensive.  It can be used to create artistic, sculptural forms, and its use has been revived in recent years by the natural building and [[sustainability]] movements.

In technical building and engineering documents such as the [[Uniform Building Code]], cob may be referred to as an "unburned clay masonry" when used in a structural context. It might also be referred to as an "aggregate" in non-structural contexts, such as a "clay and sand aggregate" or more simply an "organic aggregate," such as where the cob is an insulating filler between [[Timber framing|post and beam]] construction.

==History and usage==
[[File:Cob stitch copy.jpg|thumb|'Cob stitch' repair on old traditional cob cottage in [[Devon]], England]]
''Cob'' is an English term attested to around the year 1600&lt;ref&gt;"cob, n2. 1." ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; for an ancient building material that has been used for building since prehistoric times. The etymology of ''cob'' and ''cobbing'' is unclear, but in several senses means to ''beat'' or ''strike'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cob|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cob|website=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=13 January 2017|quote=verb: ''(transitive) British informal'' to beat, esp on the buttocks}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is how cob material is applied to a wall.

Some of the oldest man-made structures in Afghanistan are composed of [[rammed earth]] and cob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McArdle |first=Patricia |title=Afghanistan’s Last Locavores |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/opinion/20mcardle.html?_r=2 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobwork (''tabya'') was used in the [[Maghreb]] and [[al-Andalus]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, and was described in detail by [[Ibn Khaldun]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge Hill |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Routledge Hill |editor1-last=Rashed |editor1-first=Roshdi |editor2-last=Morelon |editor2-first=Régis |year=1996 |chapter=Engineering |title=Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science |volume=3 |isbn=0-415-02063-8 |page=766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cob structures can be found in a variety of climates across the globe. European examples include:

* in England, notably in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in the [[West Country]], and in [[East Anglia]] (where it is referred to as ''clay lump'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bouwens|first1=Dirk|title=Earth Buildings and Their Repair|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com|website=www.buildingconservation.com|publisher=Cathedral Publications Ltd.|accessdate=13 January 2017}} ''[reproduced from The Building Conservation Directory, 1997]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] and [[Gower Peninsula]] in Wales{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* in [[Donegal Bay]] in [[Ulster]] and in Munster, South-West [[Ireland]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* in [[Finistère|Finisterre]] in [[Brittany]], where many homes have survived over 500 years and are still inhabited{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Many old cob buildings can be found in [[Africa]], the Middle East, and many parts of the southwestern United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} A number of cob cottages survive from mid-19th-century New Zealand.&lt;ref name=NZHPT&gt;Dozens of cob cottages are [http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/SearchResults.aspx?s=s&amp;NameOrID=cob listed on the Register] of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, e.g. {{cite web|title=Ferrymead Cob Cottage|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=3101|work=Rarangi Taonga: the Register of Historic Places, Historic Areas, Wahi Tapu and Wahi Tapu Areas|publisher=New Zealand Historic Places Trust Pouhere Taonga|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, English cob was made by mixing the clay-based subsoil with sand, straw and water using [[oxen]] to trample it. English soils contain varying amounts of [[chalk]], and cob made with significant amounts of chalk are called ''chalk cob'' or ''[[wychert]]''. The earthen mixture was then ladled onto a stone [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] in [[Course (architecture)|courses]] and trodden onto the wall by workers in a process known as ''cobbing''. The construction would progress according to the time required for the prior course to dry. After drying, the walls would be trimmed and the next course built, with lintels for later openings such as doors and windows being placed as the wall takes shape.&lt;ref name="SnellCallahan2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=Snell |last2=Tim |first2=Callahan |title=Building Green: A Complete How-to Guide to Alternative Building Methods : Earth Plaster, Straw Bale, Cordwood, Cob, Living Roofs |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gGEbRyok6f0C&amp;pg=PA276 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-1-60059-534-9 |pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls of a cob house are generally about {{convert|24|in|cm}} thick, and windows were correspondingly deep-set, giving the homes a characteristic internal appearance. The thick walls provided excellent thermal mass which was easy to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. Walls with a high thermal mass value act as a thermal buffer inside the home.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Goodhew |first1=Steven |last2=Griffiths |first2=Richard

&lt;/ref&gt;
The material has a long life-span even in rainy and/or humid climates, provided a tall foundation and large roof overhang are present.

Cob is fireproof, while "fire cob" (cob without straw or fiber) is a refractory material (the same material, essentially, as unfired common red brick), and historically, has been used to make chimneys, fireplaces, forges and crucibles. Without fiber, however, cob loses most of its tensile strength.

==Modern cob buildings==

[[File:Beautifying cob oven.jpg|thumb|250px|Decorating a cob oven]]When Kevin McCabe constructed a two-story, four bedroom cob house in [[England]], [[UK]] in 1994, it was reputedly the first cob residence built in the country in 70 years. His techniques remained very traditional; the only innovations he made were using a [[tractor]] to mix the cob and adding sand or shillet, a gravel of crushed [[shale]], to reduce shrinkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[File:The Cob House - Cadhay.jpg|thumb|left|A modern cob house near [[Ottery St Mary]], [[United Kingdom]]]] From 2002 to 2004, sustainability enthusiast [[Rob Hopkins]] initiated the construction of a cob house for his family, the first new one in [[Ireland]] in circa one hundred years. It was a community project, but an unidentified [[arsonist]] destroyed it shortly before completion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transitionculture.org/about/ Practical Sustainability: About]&lt;/ref&gt; The house, located at The Hollies Centre for Practical Sustainability in [[County Cork]], was being rebuilt as of 2010. There are a number of other completed modern cob houses and more are planned, including a public education centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Welcome to The Hollies |url=http://thehollies.ie |title=The Hollies |publisher=thehollies.ie |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000-01, a modern, four bedroom cob house in [[Worcestershire]], [[England]], [[UK]], designed by Associated Architects, was sold for [[Pound sterling|£]]999,000. Cobtun House was erected in 2001 and won the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' Sustainable Building of the Year award in 2005. The total construction cost was £300,000, but the metre-thick outer cob wall cost only £20,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the Pacific Northwest of the [[United States]] there has been a resurgence of cob construction, both as an alternative building practice and one desired for its form, function, and cost effectiveness. Pat Hennebery, Tracy Calvert, Elke Cole, and the Cobworks workshops erected more than ten cob houses in the Southern [[Gulf Islands]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2010, Sota Construction Services in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] completed construction on its new 7,500 square foot corporate headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sotaconstruction.com/project_details.asp?id=42 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017204416/http://www.sotaconstruction.com/project_details.asp?id=42 |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured exterior cob walls along with other energy saving features like radiant heat flooring, a rooftop solar panel array, and [[daylighting]]. The cob walls, in conjunction with the other sustainable features, enabled the edifice to earn a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum rating in 2012, and it also received one of the highest scores by percentage of total points earned in any LEED category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/projects/sota-construction-office-expansion&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Ann and Gord Baird began constructing a two-storey cob house in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] for an estimated $210,000 CDN.  The home of 2,150 square feet includes heated floors, solar panels, and a southern exposure to enable [[passive solar heating]].&lt;ref name="Indy2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/a-dream-home-made-of-mud/article1079750/|title=A Dream Home Made of Mud|last=Barton|first=Adriana|date=3 August 2007|work=|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|via=|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh architect [[Ianto Evans]] and researcher Linda Smiley refined the construction technique known as "Oregon Cob" in the 1980s and 1990s. Oregon Cob integrates the variation of wall layup technique which uses loaves of mud mixed with sand and straw with a rounded architectural stylism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/history.html The History of Cob]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/17/kemery.html Building with Oregon Cob]&lt;/ref&gt; They are experimenting with a mixture of cob and straw bale denominated "[[balecob]]".

The '''length of the day''', which has increased over the long term of [[Earth's history]] due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal effects]], is also subject to fluctuations on a shorter scale of time. Exact measurements of time by [[atomic clock]]s and satellite [[laser ranging]] have revealed that the length of day (LOD) is subject to a number of different changes. These subtle variations have periods that range from a few weeks to a few years. They are attributed to interactions between the dynamic [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and Earth itself. The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] monitors the changes.

==Introduction==
In the absence of external torques, the total [[angular momentum]] of Earth as a whole system must be constant. Internal torques are due to relative movements and mass redistribution of Earth's core, mantle, crust, oceans, atmosphere, and [[cryosphere]]. In order to keep the total [[angular momentum]] constant, a change of the angular momentum  in one region  must necessarily be balanced by angular momentum changes in the other regions.

Crustal movements (such as [[continental drift]]) or polar cap melting are slow secular events. The characteristic coupling time between core and mantle has been estimated to be on the order of ten years, and the so-called 'decade fluctuations' of [[Earth's rotation]] rate are thought to result from fluctuations within the core, transferred to the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hide|first=R.|title=Fluctuations in the Earth's Rotation and the Topography of the Core–Mantle Interface|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=328|issue=1599|pages=351–363|doi=10.1098/rsta.1989.0040|date=1989|bibcode = 1989RSPTA.328..351H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of day (LOD) varies significantly even for time scales from a few years down to weeks (Figure), and the observed fluctuations in the LOD - after eliminating the effects of external torques - are  a direct consequence of the action of internal torques. These short term fluctuations are very probably generated by the interaction between the solid Earth and the atmosphere.

==Observations==
[[Image:Deviation of day length from SI day.svg|thumb|Deviation of day length from SI based day]]
Any change of the axial component of the atmospheric [[angular momentum]] (AAM) must be accompanied by a corresponding change of the angular momentum of Earth's crust and mantle (due to the law of conservation of angular momentum). Because the [[moment of inertia]] of the system mantle-crust is only slightly influenced by atmospheric pressure loading, this mainly requires a change in the [[angular velocity]] of the solid Earth; ''i.e.'', a change of LOD. The LOD can presently be measured to a high accuracy over integration times of only a few hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Douglas|title=Geophysical applications of very-long-baseline interferometry|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1991|volume=63|issue=4|pages=899–918|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.63.899|bibcode = 1991RvMP...63..899R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[general circulation model]]s of the atmosphere allow high precision determination of changes in AAM in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eubanks|first=T.

In particular, one recognizes an annual period of LOD with an amplitude of 0.34&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, maximizing on February 3, and a semiannual period with an amplitude of 0.29&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, maximizing on May 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Richard D.|title=The axial momentum balance of Earth and its fluid envelope|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=1993|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.1007/BF01044076|bibcode = 1993SGeo...14....1R }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 10‑day fluctuations of the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;milliseconds. Interseasonal fluctuations reflecting [[El Niño]] events and quasi-biennial oscillations have also been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carter, W.E. |author2=D.S.

O.|title=Earth's Variable Rotation|journal=Science|date=1991|volume=253|issue=5020|pages=629–637|doi=10.1126/science.253.5020.629|pmid=17772366|bibcode = 1991Sci...253..629H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchange of angular momentum==

One means of exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and the non gaseous parts of the earth is evaporation and precipitation. Massive quantities of water are in continual flux between the oceans and the atmosphere. As the mass of water (vapour) rises its rotation must slow due to conservation of angular momentum. Equally when if falls as rain, its rate of rotation will increase to conserve angular momentum. Any net global transfer of water mass from oceans to the atmosphere or the opposite implies a change in the speed of rotation of the solid/liquid Earth which will be reflected in LOD. {{citation needed | date = March 2016}}

Observational evidence shows that there is no significant time delay between the change of AAM and its corresponding change of LOD for periods longer than about 10&amp;nbsp;days. This implies a strong coupling between atmosphere and solid Earth due to surface [[friction]] with a time constant of  about 7&amp;nbsp;days, the spin-down time of the [[Ekman layer]]. This spin-down time is the characteristic time for the transfer of atmospheric axial angular momentum to Earth's surface and vice versa.

The zonal wind-component on the ground, which is most effective for the transfer of axial angular momentum between Earth and atmosphere, is the component describing rigid rotation of the  atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Volland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volland|first=H.|title=Atmosphere and Earth's rotation|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=101–144|doi=10.1007/BF01904476|bibcode = 1996SGeo...17..101V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zonal wind of this component has the  amplitude ''u'' at the equator relative to the ground, where  ''u''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 indicates superrotation and ''u''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 0 indicates retrograde rotation with respect to the solid Earth. All other wind terms merely redistribute the AAM with latitude, an effect that cancels out when averaged over the globe.

Surface friction allows the atmosphere to 'pick up' angular momentum from Earth in the case of retrograde rotation or release it to Earth in the case of superrotation. Averaging over longer time scales, no exchange  of AAM with the solid Earth takes place. Earth and atmosphere are decoupled. This implies that the  ground level zonal wind-component responsible for rigid rotation must be zero on the average. Indeed, the observed meridional structure of the climatic mean zonal wind on the ground shows westerly winds (from the west) in middle latitudes beyond about ± 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; latitude and easterly winds (from the east) in low latitudes—the [[trade wind]]s—as well as near the poles
([[prevailing winds]]).&lt;ref name="Murgatroyd"&gt;Murgatroyd, R.J., .
The structure and dynamics of the stratosphere, in Coby G.A. (ed): ''The Global Circulation of the  Atmosphere'',  Roy. Met. Soc., London, p. 159, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;
The atmosphere picks up angular momentum from Earth at low and high latitudes and transfers the same amount to Earth at middle latitudes.

Any short term fluctuation of the rigidly rotating zonal wind-component is then accompanied by a corresponding  change in LOD. In order to estimate the order of magnitude of that effect, one may consider the total atmosphere to rotate  rigidly with velocity ''u'' (in m/s) without surface friction. Then this value is related to the corresponding change of the length of day Δ''{{tau}}'' (in milliseconds) as
 
:''u'' ≃ 2.7 Δ''{{tau}}'' {{citation needed | date = November 2017}}

The annual component of the change of the length of day of Δ''{{tau}}''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.34&amp;nbsp;ms corresponds then to a superrotation of ''u''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.9&amp;nbsp;m/s, and the semiannual component of Δ''{{tau}}''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.29&amp;nbsp;ms to ''u''&amp;nbsp;≃ 0.8&amp;nbsp;m/s.

A '''defensible space''', in the context of [[fire control]], is a natural and/or landscaped area around a structure that has been maintained and designed to reduce fire danger. The practice is sometimes called  '''firescaping'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626085521/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }} SBCFD-Firescaping. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Defensible space" is also used in the context of [[wildfire]]s, especially in the [[wildland-urban interface]] (WUI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/communications_firesafety_100feet.php CAL-FIRE intro Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt; This defensible space reduces the risk that fire will spread from one area to another, or to a structure, and provides [[firefighter]]s access and a safer area from which to defend a threatened area. Firefighters sometimes do not attempt to protect structures without adequate defensible space, as it is less safe and less likely to succeed.

==Criteria==
*A first concept of defensible space for most fire agencies' primary goal of fuel reduction is a recommended or required defensible space around a structure to extend for at least {{convert|100|ft|m}} in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_requlation.pdf SBCFD-regulation. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second concept of defensible space is "fuel reduction." This means plants are selectively thinned and pruned to reduce the combustible fuel mass of the remaining plants. The goal is to break up the more continuous and dense uninterrupted layer of vegetation.
*A third concept of defensible space is "[[fuel ladder]]" management. Like rungs on a ladder, vegetation can be present at varying heights from groundcover to trees. Ground fuel "rungs", such as dried grasses, can transmit fire to shrub rungs, which then transmit up tree branch rungs into the tree canopy. A burning tree produces embers that can blow to new areas, spreading and so making it more difficult to control a wildland fire. One guideline is for a typical separation of three times the height of the lower fuel to the next fuel ladder. For example, a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} shrub under a tree would need a spacing of {{convert|6|ft|m}} to the lowest limbs of the tree. Since wildfires burn faster uphill than on flat land, fuel ladder spacing may need to be greater for slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419051651/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }} SBCFD-intro. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape use==
The term defensible space in landscape ("firescape") use refers to the {{convert|100|ft|m}} zone surrounding a structure. Often the location is in the [[wildland–urban interface]]. This area need not be devoid of vegetation by using naturally fire resistive plants that are spaced, pruned and trimmed, and irrigated, to minimize the fuel mass available to ignite and also to hamper the spread of a fire.

#The first {{convert|30|ft|m}} is the "Defensible Space Zone," of a defensible space around a structure. It is where [[vegetation]] is kept to a minimum combustible mass. A guideline used in this zone can be "low, lean and green."
#The second distance of {{convert|30|to|100|ft|m}}, is the "Reduced Fuel Zone" of a defensible space around a structure. In this area of the defensible space, fuels/vegetation are separated vertically and horizontally depending on the vegetation type. This is done by: thinning, pruning, and removal of selected vegetation; and limbing up trees from lower vegetation and the lateral separation of [[canopy (forest)|tree canopies]]. types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_guidelines.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012355/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/defensible_space_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }} CAL-FIRE-guidelines. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important component is ongoing maintenance of the fire-resistant landscaping for reduced fuel loads and fire fighting access. Fire resistive plants that are not maintained can [[Desiccation|desiccate]], die, or amass [[Coarse woody debris|deadwood debris]], and become fire assistive. Irrigation systems and pruning can help maintain a plant's fire resistance. Maintaining access roads and driveways clear of side and low-hanging vegetation can allow large fire equipment to reach properties and structures.
Some agencies recommend clearing combustible vegetation at minimum horizontal 10&amp;nbsp;ft from roads and driveways a vertical of 13&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;inches above them. Considering the plant material involved is important to not create unintended consequences to habitat integrity and unnecessary aesthetic issues. Street signs, and homes clearly identified with the numerical address, assist access also.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/homeowners_checklist.pdf  SBCFD Retrieved 4/26/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626085521/http://www.sbcfire.com/fp/hrp/landscape%20checklist.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }} SBCFD-checklist. Retrieved 4/26/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintended consequences==
The unintended negative consequences of [[erosion]] and native [[habitat]] loss can result from some unskillful defensible space applications. The disturbance of the soil surface, such as garden [[Tillage|soil cultivation]] in and [[firebreak]]s beyond native landscape zones areas, destroys the native plant cover and exposes open soil, accelerating [[invasive species]] of plants ("invasive exotics") spreading and replacing native [[habitat]]s.&lt;ref name=neutral&gt;{{citation| last=Colautti| first=Robert I.; MacIsaac, Hugh J.| title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal= Diversity and Distributions|year=2004|url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf|format=PDF| volume=10| pages=135–141| accessdate=2007-07-11| doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In suburban and [[wildland–urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in mistaken excessive [[clearcutting]] of native and [[Introduced species|non-invasive introduced]] shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for [[Invasive species|invasive plant species]], and also to erosion and landslides. Negative aesthetic consequences to natural and landscaped areas can be minimized with integrated and balanced defensible space practices.&lt;ref&gt;(September 21, 2006).

Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. 
Specifically, while the [[evolutionary trade-off]] between [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging|growth and aging]] has been well established, 
the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without [[scientific consensus]], and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV | year = 2010| title = Why the disposable soma theory cannot explain why women live longer and why we age | journal = Aging | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 884–887 | doi=10.18632/aging.100253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==

British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] review article.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The theory was inspired by [[Leslie Orgel|Leslie Orgel's]] [[Error catastrophe|Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging]], which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with [[evolutionary genetics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Principles==
The disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in [[resource allocation]] between [[Maintenance of an organism|somatic maintenance]] and [[Parental investment|reproductive investment]]. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionarily unsound]] due to the fact that one's [[Survivorship curve|offspring would likely die before reproductive age]]. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to [[DNA damage theory of aging|progressive cellular damage and senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drenos F, Kirkwood, TB | year = 2005| title = Modelling the disposable soma theory of ageing | journal = Mech Ageing Dev. | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103| doi=10.1016/j.mad.2004.09.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased [[Regeneration (biology)#Tissues|durability of nonrenewable parts]]; (2) the costs of maintenance involving [[Autophagy|cell renewal]], and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kirkwood, TB, Rose MR | year = 1991| title = Evolution of senescence: late survival sacrificed for reproduction.| journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 332 | issue = 1262 | pages = 15–24| doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a nutshell, [[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis|aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff]] for increased reproductive robustness in youth.

== Mechanisms == 
[[File:IGF-1Pathway.png|thumb|The [[IGF-1|IGF-1 pathway]], which represses [[FOXO]], thus preventing [[gene expression]] of longevity-inducing proteins.]]

=== Growth and somatic maintenance === 
{{main|Mechanistic target of rapamycin#Aging}}
Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a [[phosphorylation cascade]]. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating [[FOX proteins|forkhead transcription factor]] (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to [[oxidative stress |oxidative stress response]], such as [[antioxidants]], [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperones]], and [[heat-shock proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=O'Neill BT, Lee KY, Klaus K, Softic S; et al. | year = 2016 | title = Insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulate FoxO-mediated signaling in muscle proteostasis | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 126 | issue = 9 | pages = 3433-3346 | doi=10.1172/JCI86522| pmc = 5004956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the [[Mechanistic target of rapamycin|mTOR]] pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]], and also inhibits [[autophagy]], a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Johnson SC, Rabinovitch PS, Kaeberlein M| year = 2013 | title = mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease| journal = Nature | volume = 493 | issue = | pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1038/nature11861| bibcode = 2013Natur.493..338J| pmc = 3687363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Decline of autophagy causes [[neurodegeneration]], [[protein aggregation]] and [[premature aging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Komatsu M, Waguri S, Chiba T, Murata S; et al. | year = 2006 | title = Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = | pages = 880–884 | doi=10.1038/nature04723| bibcode = 2006Natur.441..880K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters [[immune responses]] and  stimulates [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) inhibitors such as [[p16]] and [[p21]]. This leads to alteration of the [[stem-cell niche]] and results in [[Stem cell theory of aging|stem cell exhaustion]], another theorized mechanism of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Castilho RM1, Squarize CH, Chodosh LA, Williams BO; et al. | year = 2009| title = mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.| journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–289. | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction and somatic maintenance===
The mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, [[Cell signaling|the cellular mechanisms]] have yet to be explored. However, with regards to [[cellular replication]], the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which [[Hayflick limit|limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Role of telomeres and telomerase in cancer | journal = Semin Cancer Biol. | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 349–353 | doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the formation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kaeberlein M, McVey M, Guarente L | year = 1999 | title = The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms| journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 13 | issue = 19| pages = 2570–2580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==

===Growth and aging===
There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.

==== Animal models ====
In [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] models of [[Mus musculus|mice]], such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, [[Scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], [[Hypertrophy|enlargement of the organs]], kidney lesions and [[Cancer|increased cancer risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Bartke A1, Brown-Borg H | year = 2004 | title = Life extension in the dwarf mouse | journal = Curr Top Dev Biol. | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 189–225| doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also seen in different breeds of [[dogs]], where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 [[haplotype]], reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the [[Great Dane]] (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are [[homozygous]] for the IGF-1 I [[allele]], which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sutter NB, Bustamante CD, Chase K, Gray MM | year = 2007| title =A Single IGF1 Allele Is a Major Determinant of Small Size in Dogs| journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5821 | pages = 112–115 | doi=10.1126/science.1137045| bibcode =2007Sci...316..112S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models====
Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of [[growth hormone]] to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various [[biomarkers]] implicated in aging, such as [[Sarcopenia|decreased muscle mass]], bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudman D1, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA; et al. | year = 1990| title =Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 323 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199007053230101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased [[mortality rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Takala J1, Ruokonen E, Webster NR, Nielsen MS, Zandstra DF, et al. | year = 1999| title =
Increased mortality associated with growth hormone treatment in critically ill adults| journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 341 | issue = 11 | pages = 785–792 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199909093411102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[Genome Sequencing|genomic studies]] have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Longo VD, Finch CE.| year = 2003| title =Evolutionary medicine: from dwarf model systems to healthy centenarians?| journal = Science | volume = 299 | issue = 5611 | pages = 1342–1346 | doi=10.1126/science.1077991}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also shown that individuals with [[Laron syndrome]], an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of age-related diseases such as [[type 2 diabetes]] and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Guevara-Aguirre J, Balasubramanian P, Guevara-Aguirre M, Wei M; et al. | year = 2011| title = Growth hormone receptor deficiency is associated with a major reduction in pro-aging signaling, cancer, and diabetes in humans | journal = Sci. Transl. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 70 | pages = 70–83 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, human [[centenarians]] around the world are disproportionately of [[short stature]], and have low levels of IGF-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Govindaraju D, Atzmon G, Barzilai N. | year = 2015| title =Genetics, lifestyle and longevity: Lessons from centenarians.| journal = Appl Transl Genom.  | volume = 4| issue =  | pages = 23–32 | doi=10.1016/j.atg.2015.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction and aging===
Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Descamps S, Boutin S, Berteaux D, Gaillard JM.| year = 2006| title =Best squirrels trade a long life for an early reproduction| journal = Proc Biol Sci   | volume = 273| issue = 1599 | pages = 2369–2374 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has been found that [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]] is a costly mechanism that alters the [[Fatty acid metabolism|metabolism of fat]]. [[Lipids]] invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hansen M, Flatt T, Aguilaniu H.| year = 2013| title =Reproduction, fat metabolism, and life span: what is the connection?| journal = Cell Metab.| volume = 17| issue = 1 | pages = 10–19 | doi= 10.1016/j.cmet.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Animal models ====

The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that [[castration]] or [[Genetic disorder|genetic deformities]] of [[Reproductive system|reproduction organs]] was [[correlated]] with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Drori D, Folman Y.| year = 1976| title =Environmental effects on longevity in the male rat: exercise, mating, castration and restricted feeding| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 11| issue = 1 | pages = 25–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flatt T| year = 2011| title =Survival costs of reproduction in ''Drosophila''.| journal = Exp Gerontol.| volume = 46| issue = 5 | pages = 369–375 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hsin H, Kenyon C| year = 1999| title =Signals from the reproductive system regulate the lifespan of ''C. elegans''| journal =Nature| volume =399| issue = 6734 | pages = 362–366 | doi= 10.1038/20694| bibcode =1999Natur.399..362H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in [[red squirrels]], it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In another study, researchers selectively bred [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] over three years to develop two different [[strain (biology)|strain]]s, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the [[Ovarian|ovarian-associated]] gene ''ovoD1'', resulting in defective [[oogenesis]], the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that "aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sgrò CM, Partridge L| year = 1999| title = A delayed wave of death from reproduction in Drosophila.| journal =Science| volume =286| issue =5449 | pages = 2521–2524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent aging researcher [[Steven N. Austad|Steven Austad]] also performed a large-scale [[ecological]] study on the [[coast]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1993. Austad isolated two [[opossum]] populations, one from the [[predator]]-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of [[Sapelo]]. According to the disposable soma theory, a [[Genetic isolate|genetically isolated]] population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail [[collagen]] [[Cross linking|cross-linking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Austad, SN| year = 1993| title =Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums (''Didelphis virginiana'')| journal = Journal of Zoology| volume = 229| issue = 4 | pages = 695–708 | doi= 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1993.tb02665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human models ====

In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that [[Eunuch|castrated men]] live longer than their [[fertile]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hamilton JB, Mestler GE| year = 1969| title =Mortality and survival: comparison of eunuchs with intact men and women in a mentally retarded population)| journal = J. Gerontol.| volume = 24| issue = 4 | pages = 395–411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Westendorp RG, Kirkwood TB| year = 1998| title =Human longevity at the cost of reproductive success |journal = Nature| volume = 396| issue = 6713 | pages = 743–746 | doi= 10.1038/25519}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Perls TT, Alpert L, Fretts RC| year = 1997| title =Middle-aged mothers live longer |journal = Nature| volume = 389| issue = 6647 | pages = 133 | doi= 10.1038/38148| bibcode = 1997Natur.389..133P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship between cell damage and aging===
{{main|Free radical theory}}{{main|DNA damage theory of aging}}
[[File:Naked Mole Rat Eating.jpg|thumb|The [[naked mole rat]] has a [[naked mole rat#Longevity|disproportionately long life of 30 years]] through efficient cellular repair mechanisms.]]
There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the [[free radical theory of aging]] and the [[DNA damage theory of aging]]. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents ''[[in vitro]]'' show much greater [[mutation]] rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C. | year = 2011| title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle| volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853–3856 | doi=10.4161/cc.10.22.18302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other studies have been conducted on the [[naked mole rat]], a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the [[brown rat]] (3 years) by [[Fold (higher-order function)|ten-fold]]. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of [[superoxide dismutase]], a [[reactive oxygen species]] clearing [[antioxidant]]. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of [[base excision repair]], DNA damage response signaling, [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination repair]], [[mismatch repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]], and [[non-homologous end joining]]. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to [[oxidation]], [[misfolding]], [[ubiquitination]], and had increased [[Translation|translational fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Azpurua J, Ke Z, Chen IX, Zhang Q, Ermolenko DN; et al. | year = 2013| title = Naked mole-rat has increased translational fidelity compared with the mouse, as well as a unique 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A| volume = 110 | issue = 43 | pages =17350–17355 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1313473110| bibcode =2013PNAS..11017350A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have been conducted on patients with [[Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome]] (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the [[Lamin A protein|lamin proteins]], which regulate the organization of the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]] and [[nuclear envelope]] for [[mitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pollex RL1, Hegele RA | year = 2004| title = Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome | journal = Clin. Genet.| volume = 66| issue = 5 | pages =375–381 | doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2004.00315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of [[caloric restriction]], autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and [[recycling]] of damaged proteins and [[organelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Glick D1, Barth S, Macleod KF. | year = 2010| title = Autophagy: cellular and molecular mechanisms| journal = J. Pathol. | volume = 221 | issue = 1 | pages =3–12| doi=10.1002/path.2697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an [[Evolution|evolutionary perspective]] on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

===Caloric restriction===
{{main|Calorie restriction#Sirtuin-mediated mechanism}}
[[File:Soma Disposable.png|thumb|Schematic showing the reallocation of energy investment towards [[DNA repair|self-repair]] during [[caloric restriction]].]]
Critics have pointed out the supposed [[Inconsistency|inconsistencies]] of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Blagosklonny, MV| year = 2010| title = Solving puzzles of aging: From disposable soma to signal-transduction pathways| journal = Russ J Gen Chem. | volume = 80 | issue = | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less [[Caloric|caloric intake]], there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Shanley DP, Kirkwood TB.| year = 2000| title = Calorie restriction and aging: a life-history analysis.| journal = Evolution | volume = 54 | issue =3 | pages =1407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in [[Sterility (physiology)|impaired fertility]], but leave an otherwise healthy organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Holliday R.| year = 2000| title = Food, reproduction and longevity: is the extended lifespan of calorie-restricted animals an evolutionary adaptation?| journal = BioEssays | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages =125–127|doi=10.1002/bies.950100408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Masoro EJ, Austad SN.| year = 1996| title = The evolution of the antiaging action of dietary restriction: a hypothesis.| journal = J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci | volume = 51 | issue =6 | pages =387–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in [[famine]]. Mechanistically, the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]-dependent [[Deacetylate|deacetylase]] [[Sirtuin 1]] (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases [[insulin sensitivity]], decreases the amount of [[inflammatory cytokine]]s, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cantó C, Auwerx J.| year = 2009| title = Caloric restriction, SIRT1 and longevity.| journal =Trends Endocrinol Metab| volume = 20 | issue =7 | pages =325–331|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In additional to differential [[wikt:partitioning|partitioning]] of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of [[free radicals]] like [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radicals]], which damage important cellular components, particularly [[mitochondria]]. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, [[Myocardial|myocardial injury]], [[Anemia|severe anemia]], and premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Pérez VI, Bokov A, Van Remmen H, Mele J; et al.| year = 2009| title = Is the oxidative stress theory of aging dead?| journal =Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1790 | issue =10 | pages =1005–1014|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grandmother hypothesis===
{{main|Menopause#Evolutionary rationale}}
Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Ginter E, Simko V | year = 2013| title = Women live longer than men| journal = Bratisl Lek Listy.  | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages =45–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the [[grandmother hypothesis]]. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that [[menopause]] comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their [[grandchildren]], increasing their evolutionary fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hawkes K | year = 2003| title = Grandmothers and the evolution of human longevity| journal = Am. J. Hum. Biol.| volume =15 | issue =3  | pages =380–400| doi= 10.1002/ajhb.10156}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their [[Age and female fertility|fertile years]], their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Vinicius L, Mace R, Migliano A| year = 2014| title = Variation in Male Reproductive Longevity across Traditional Societies| journal = PLoS One| volume =9 | issue =11  | pages =e112236| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0112236| bibcode =2014PLoSO...9k2236V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased [[Testosterone|testosterone levels]] in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Celec P, Ostatníková D, Hodosy J. | year = 2015| title = On the effects of testosterone on brain behavioral functions| journal = Front. Neurosci.| volume =9 | issue =  | pages =12| doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contradicting models === 
A few [[Contradiction|contradicting]] animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are [[mammalian]], they are highly [[atypical]] in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in [[Eusociality|eusocial societies]], where breeding is usually designated to a [[Eusociality#In mammals|queen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Dammann P, Burda H | year = 2006| title =Sexual activity and reproduction delay ageing in a mammal.| journal = Curr. Biol.| volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 117–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex biases and environment ===
The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as [[Parental investment#Females as the more investing sex|females carry a greater burden in reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hammers M, Richardson DS, Burke T, Komdeur J. | year = 2013| title = The impact of reproductive investment and early-life environmental conditions on senescence: support for the disposable soma hypothesis.| journal = J Evol Biol | volume = 26| issue = 9 | pages = 1999–2007| doi=10.1111/jeb.12204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the [[Estrogen|hormonal fluctuations]] that occur with [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wu JJ, Liu J, Chen EB, Wang JJ; et al. | year = 2013| title = Increased mammalian lifespan and a segmental and tissue-specific slowing of aging after genetic reduction of mTOR expression| journal = Cell Rep. | volume = 4| issue = 5 | pages = 913–920| doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2013.07.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, [[aging#Biological basis|genetic]] and [[Gene–environment interaction|environmental factors]], rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that [[Poverty|poorer individuals]], to whom nutritious food and [[medical care]] is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Murray, S. | year = 2006| title = Poverty and health| journal = CMAJ | volume = 174| issue = 7 | pages = 923| doi=10.1503/cmaj.060235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth's shadow and Belt of Venus.jpg|thumb|220px|Earth's shadow (blue) and the [[Belt of Venus]] (pink) at [[dawn]], seen above the horizon where the sky meets the sea, looking west from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]], [[San Francisco]].&lt;br/&gt;
{{small|(Note: The lowest blue-grey area is the surface of the [[Pacific Ocean]], not the sky.)}}]]

'''Earth's shadow''' or '''Earth shadow''' is the [[shadow]] that [[Earth]] itself casts onto [[Earth's atmosphere|its atmosphere]] and into [[outer space]], toward the [[antisolar point]]. During [[Twilight#Civil twilight|twilight]] (both early [[dusk]] and late [[dawn]]), the shadow's visible fringe (sometimes called the '''dark segment''' or '''twilight wedge'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=twilight_wedge&lt;/ref&gt;) appears in a clear [[sky]] as a dark and [[diffuse]]d band low above the [[horizon]].

==Appearance==
[[File:Golden Gate Bridge, the Belt of Venus and the Earth's shadow.jpg|thumb|250px|Earth's shadow and the [[Belt of Venus]] at [[dusk]], looking east from the [[Marin Headlands]] just north of [[San Francisco]] in October 2010.&lt;br/&gt;{{small|(Note: A thin layer of greyish cloud partially obscures the horizon in this image.)}}]]

Earth's shadow cast onto the atmosphere can be viewed during the "civil" stage of [[twilight]], assuming the sky is clear and the [[horizon]] is relatively unobstructed. The shadow's fringe appears as a dark bluish to purplish band that stretches over [[azimuth|180°]] of the horizon&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt; opposite the [[Sun]], i.e. in the eastern sky at [[dusk]] and in the western sky at [[dawn]]. Before [[sunrise]], Earth's shadow appears to recede as the Sun rises; after [[sunset]], the shadow appears to rise as the Sun sets.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;

Earth's shadow is best seen when the horizon is low, such as over the sea, and when the sky conditions are clear. In addition, the higher the observer's [[elevation]] is to view the horizon, the sharper the shadow appears.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Belt of Venus==
{{main|Belt of Venus}}
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Full moon]] rising, as seen through the Belt of Venus. A very small part of the Earth's shadow (dark blue) is also visible in this image, but the horizon here is too high for more of the Earth's shadow to be seen.]]

A related phenomenon in the same part of the sky is the [[Belt of Venus]], or anti-twilight arch, a pinkish band visible above the bluish shade of Earth's shadow, named after the [[planet]] [[Venus]] which, when visible, is typically located in this region of the sky.
No [[terminator (solar)|defined line]] divides the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band blends into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

The Belt of Venus is quite a different phenomenon from the [[afterglow]], which appears in the geometrically opposite part of the sky.

===Color===
When the Sun is near the horizon around [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]], the sunlight appears reddish. This is because the light rays are penetrating an especially [[air mass (astronomy)|thick layer]] of the atmosphere, which works as a filter, [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] all but the longer (redder) wavelengths. 

From the observer's perspective, the red sunlight directly illuminates [[particulates|small particles]] in the lower atmosphere in the sky opposite of the Sun. The red light is [[backscatter]]ed to the observer, which is the reason why the [[Belt of Venus]] appears pink. 

The lower the setting Sun descends, the less defined the boundary between Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus appears. This is because the setting Sun now illuminates a thinner part of the upper atmosphere. There the red light is not scattered because fewer particles are present, and the eye only sees the "normal" (usual) blue sky, which is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] from air molecules. Eventually, both Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus dissolve into the darkness of the [[night sky]].&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Color of lunar eclipses==
{{main|Lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Near Greatest Eclipse 20101221 0011-crop.jpg|thumb|200px|A total [[lunar eclipse]] on [[December 2010 lunar eclipse|December 21, 2010]], shows the reddish light falling on the Moon's surface.]]

Earth's shadow is as curved as the planet is, and its [[umbra]] extends {{cvt|1,400,000|km|mi}} into outer space. (The [[antumbra]], however, extends indefinitely.) When the [[Sun]], Earth, and the [[Moon]] are [[syzygy (astronomy)|aligned perfectly]] (or nearly so), with Earth between the Sun and the Moon, Earth's shadow falls onto the lunar surface facing the night side of the planet, such that the shadow gradually darkens the [[full Moon]], causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. 

Even during a total lunar eclipse, a small amount of sunlight however still reaches the Moon. This indirect sunlight has been [[atmospheric refraction|refracted]] as it passed through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The air molecules and [[particulates]] in Earth's atmosphere [[Raleigh scattering|scatter]] the shorter wavelengths of this sunlight; thus, the longer wavelengths of reddish light reaches the Moon, in the same way that light at [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]] appears reddish. This weak red illumination gives the eclipsed Moon a dimly reddish or [[copper]] color.&lt;ref name=earth-shadow/&gt;

A variety of [[symbol]]s or iconographic conventions are used to represent '''[[:wikt:Earth|Earth]]''', either in the sense of [[Earth|planet Earth]], or the [[world|inhabited world]]. Representations of the [[globe]] of Earth, either with an indication of the shape of the [[continents]] or with a representation of [[longitude|meridians]] and [[Latitude|parallels]] remains a common pictographic convention to express the notion of "worldwide, global". The modern [[astronomical symbol]] for Earth as a [[planet]] uses either a stylized [[globus cruciger]] ({{resize|150%|♁}}) or a circle with a cross (representing the equator and one meridian; ({{resize|150%|🜨}}).&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia&gt;{{cite book| title = The Penny cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge | volume = 22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rJhOFg1yiqUC&amp;pg=PA197| publisher = C.

==History==

[[File:Diagrammatic T-O world map - 12th c.jpg|thumb|12th-century T-and-O representation of the world.]]

The earliest type of symbols are [[allegory|allegories]], personifications or deifications, mostly in the form of an [[Earth goddess]] (in the case of [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian mythology]] a god, [[Geb]]).

&lt;div&gt;Before the recognition of the [[spherical Earth|spherical shape]] of the Earth in the [[Hellenistic period]], the main attribute of the Earth was its being ''flat''. The [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for "earth, land" depicts a stretch of flat alluvial land with grains of sand ([[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] N16  &lt;hiero&gt;N16&lt;/hiero&gt;). Similarly, the Sumerian [[cuneiform|cuneiform sign]] for "earth" [[KI (cuneiform)|KI]] ({{resize|150%|𒆠}} U+121A0) originates as a picture of a "threshing floor". &lt;/div&gt;

The [[Earth (classical element)|classical element]] "Earth" is represented by the trigram of three broken lines in the [[I Ching]] ({{resize|150%|☷}} U+2637). The Western (early modern) [[alchemical symbol]] is a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line.
Other symbols for the earth in alchemy or mysticism include the square and the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, Jolande, ''Complex/Archetype/Symbol In The Psychology Of C G Jung'', Routledge (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=p8FdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=P146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 146],  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=p8FdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=earth&amp;f=false 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]], the [[globe]], a representation of the spherical Earth, became the main symbol representing the concept.
The globe depicted the "universe" (pictured as the [[celestial sphere]]) as well as the Earth.
The [[globus cruciger]] is the globe surmounted by a [[Christian cross]], held by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperors]] on the one hand to represent the [[Christendom|Christian]] [[ecumene]], on the other hand the [[Akakia]] represented the mortal nature of all men.
In the medieval period, the [[Early world maps|known world]] was also represented by the [[T and O map|T-and-O]] figure, representing an extremely simplified [[world map]] of the three classical continents of the [[Old World]], viz. ''[[Western Asia|Asia]], [[Continental Europe|Europe]]'' and ''[[Ancient Libya|Africa]]''.

'''Frequency-dependent selection''' is an evolutionary process by which the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a [[phenotype]] depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given [[population]].

* In '''positive''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common.
* In '''negative''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common. This is an example of [[balancing selection]].

Frequency-dependent selection is usually the result of interactions between species (predation, parasitism, or competition), or between genotypes within species (usually competitive or symbiotic), and has been especially frequently discussed with relation to [[anti-predator adaptations]]. Frequency-dependent selection can lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] equilibria, which result from interactions among genotypes within species, in the same way that multi-species equilibria require interactions between species in competition (e.g. where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; parameters in [[Lotka-Volterra]] competition equations are non-zero).

==Negative==
[[File:The anvil stone of a thrush - geograph.org.uk - 1751348.jpg|thumb|Anvil stone, where a thrush has broken open the shells of polymorphic [[grove snail]]s, may be a sign of frequency-dependent selection.]]

The first explicit statement of frequency-dependent selection appears to have been by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] in 1884, on the way that predators could maintain color polymorphisms in their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, E. B. 1884. Notes upon, or suggested by, the colours, markings and protective attitudes of certain lepidopterous larvae and pupae, and of a phytophagous hymenopterous larva. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1884: 27–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Clarke | first2 = B.C. | year = 1984 | title = Frequency-dependent selection -- homage to Poulton, E.B | url = | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 15–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known early modern statement of the principle is [[Bryan Clarke]]'s 1962 paper on [[apostatic selection]] (a synonym of negative frequency-dependent selection).&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47-70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke discussed predator attacks on polymorphic British snails, citing [[Luuk Tinbergen]]'s classic work on [[searching image]]s as support that predators such as birds tended to specialize in common forms of palatable species.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation in songbirds. Archs.Neerl.Zool. 13:265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke later argued that frequency-dependent balancing selection could explain molecular polymorphisms (often in the absence of [[heterosis]]) in opposition to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]].

Another example is [[plant self-incompatibility]] [[allele]]s. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

In human pathogens, such as the [[flu]] virus, once a particular strain has become common, most individuals have developed an immune response to that strain. But a rare, novel strain of the flu virus is able to spread quickly to almost any individual, causing continual evolution of viral strains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) is involved in the recognition of foreign antigens and cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Nei | first2 = M. | date = 1990 | title = Allelic genealogy under overdominant and frequency-dependent selection and polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex loci | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 967–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency-dependent selection may explain the high degree of polymorphism in the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghans | first1 = JA | last2 = Beltman | first2 = JB | last3 = De Boer | first3 = RJ. |date=Feb 2004 | title = MHC polymorphism under host-pathogen coevolution. | url = | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 55 | issue = 11| pages = 732–9 | doi=10.1007/s00251-003-0630-5 | pmid=14722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral ecology]], negative frequency-dependent selection often maintains multiple behavioral strategies within a species. A classic example is the Hawk-Dove model of interactions among individuals in a population. In a population with two traits A and B, being one form is better when most members are the other form.  As another example, male [[common side-blotched lizard]]s have three morphs, which either defend large territories and maintain large harems of females, defend smaller territories and keep one female, or mimic females in order to sneak matings from the other two morphs. These three morphs participate in a [[rock paper scissors]] sort of interaction such that no one morph completely outcompetes the other two.&lt;ref name="S&amp;L1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=B. |author2=C.M.

==Positive==
[[File:Müllerian mimicry among Heliconius species.tiff|thumb|Müllerian mimetic species of ''Heliconius'' from South America]]

Positive frequency-dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. A good example is warning coloration in aposematic species.  Predators are more likely to remember a common color pattern that they have already encountered frequently than one that is rare. This means that new mutants or migrants that have color patterns other than the common type are eliminated from the population by differential predation.  Positive frequency-dependent selection provides the basis for Müllerian mimicry, as described by Fritz Müller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Müller, F. |authorlink=Fritz Müller |year=1879 |title=Ituna and Thyridia; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies |journal=Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London |pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because all species involved are aposematic and share the benefit of a common, honest signal to potential predators.

Another, rather complicated example occurs in the [[Batesian mimicry]] complex between a harmless mimic, the scarlet kingsnake (''[[Lampropeltis elapsoides]]''), and the model, the eastern coral snake (''[[Micrurus fulvius]]''), in locations where the model and mimic were in deep [[sympatry]], the [[phenotype]] of the scarlet kingsnake was quite variable due to relaxed selection. But where the pattern was rare, the predator population was not 'educated', so the pattern brought no benefit. The scarlet kingsnake was much less variable on the allopatry/sympatry border of the model and mimic, most probably due to increased selection since the eastern coral snake is rare, but present, on this border. Therefore, the coloration is only advantageous once it has become common.&lt;ref name="Harper 1955–1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=G. R. |author2=Pfennig, D. W. |title=Mimicry on the edge: why do mimics vary in resemblance to their model in different parts of their geographical range? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=22 August 2007 |volume=274 |issue=1621 |pages=1955–1961 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0558 |pmid=17567563 |pmc=2275182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

Depending on the manufacturing process, enantiopure forms can be more expensive to produce than stereochemical mixtures.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}}

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species. In the edible snail ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', only one out of 20,000 is left-helical.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meierhenrich|first1=Uwe|title=Amino acids and the asymmetry of life caught in the act of formation|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540768869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61&amp;ndash;62}} The coiling of plants can have a preferred chirality and even the chewing motion of cows has a 10% excess in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Andrew M.|title=Astrochemistry From Astronomy to Astrobiology.|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470091388|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J.

Soc.]] | year=1996| volume= 118 | issue=2| pages=471–472 | doi=10.1021/ja953066g}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial presence of just 0.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% [[enantiomeric excess]] of the product.

In this system, a small enantiomeric excess of catalyst leads to a large enantiomeric excess of product.

This finding may have consequences for the development of the [[Mars Organic Detector]] scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

It was reported&lt;ref name=kojo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kojo |author2=H. Uchino |author3=M. Yoshimura |author4=K. Tanaka |title = Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere.| journal = [[Chem. Comm.]] | pages= 2146–2147 | year= 2004|doi = 10.1039/b409941a|pmid=15467844|issue=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 that excess racemic [[asparagine|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-asparagine]] (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as [[arginine]] (Arg), [[aspartic acid]] (Asp), [[glutamine]] (Gln), [[histidine]] (His), [[leucine]] (Leu), [[methionine]] (Met), [[phenylalanine]] (Phe), [[serine]] (Ser), [[valine]] (Val), [[tyrosine]] (Tyr), and [[tryptophan]] (Trp). The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing. In {{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=G. P.|title=Basic terminology of stereochemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2193–2222|doi=10.1351/pac199668122193|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.1996.68.issue-12/pac199668122193/pac199668122193.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}, the entry for ''Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure'' says "Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged"; but the entry for ''Homochiral'' says "See ''enantiomerically pure/enantiopure''."&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single [[optical isomer]] in a pair of isomers in these journals.

'''''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter''''' is a 2011 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]]. The book covers topics in [[biosemiotics]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[Abiogenesis|the origins of life]]. Broadly, the book seeks to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explain "[[aboutness]]", that is, concepts like [[intentionality]], meaning, [[normative|normativity]], purpose, and [[function (biology)|function]]; which Deacon groups together and labels as [[ententional]] phenomena.

==Core Ideas==
Deacon's first book, ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' focused on the [[Origin of language|evolution of human language]]. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion on the nature of [[semiotic]] processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of ''Incomplete Nature'' shifts from [[Human evolution|human origins]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[semiosis]]. ''Incomplete Nature'' can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of [[consciousness]] and the problem of the [[origin of life]] are inexorably linked.&lt;ref&gt;Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of [[work (physics)|work]] and [[information]]  in order to give an account of [[entention]]ality that is consistent with [[eliminative materialism]] and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenominal]] the non-physical properties of [[life]].

==Constraints==
A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of [[zero]] revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other [[ententional]] phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the [[mind body problem]]. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges.  Constraints which produce [[emergence|emergent]] phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.

==Orthograde and contragrade==
Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of [[causality]] exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with [[teleology|teleological]] explanations, Deacon returns to [[Aristotle's]] [[four causes]] and attempts to modernize them with [[thermodynamic]] concepts.

[[File:Orthograde and contragrade.jpg|450px|A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained ("ordered") state to a less constrained ("disordered") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right).]]

'''Orthograde''' changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[formal cause]]. More loosely, [[Aristotle's]] [[final cause]] can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contragrade''' changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do [[work (physics)|work]]. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics==
Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical [[thermodynamics]], with an extended discussion about how consistently [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium systems]] can interact and combine to produce novel [[emergence|emergent]] properties. 
[[File:Homomorphoteleo.jpg|thumb|400px]]

Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: '''Homeodynamic''' systems combine to produce '''morphodynamic''' systems which combine to produce '''teleodynamic''' systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of [[self organization]].

===Homeodynamics===
Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical [[thermodynamic systems]] like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of [[thermodynamics|classic thermodynamics]]. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp.561 "Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience."&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum [[entropy]] state (disorderliness) is achieved.

===Morphodynamics===
A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]]. Other common examples are [[Snowflake#formation|snowflake formation]], [[whirlpools]] and the [[stimulated emission]] of [[laser]] light.

'''Maximum entropy production:''' The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, [[density]] effects come into play. Simple [[diffusion]] can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more [[buoyant]] than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing [[convection]] currents.

'''Two systems:''' The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact.

'''Self organization:''' The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell.

'''Synergy and constraint:''' What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining.

===Teleodynamics===
A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when [[ententional]] qualities like [[Function (biology)|function]], [[purpose]] and [[normative|normativity]] emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autogenesis====
Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896328 The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.] Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autogenesis.jpg|thumb|500px|Autogen pg 339]]

'''Reciprocal catalysis:''' An autogen consists of two self [[Catalysts|catalyzing]] cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a [[chemoton]]. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a [[lipid]] that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a [[microtubule]] or some other closed [[capsid]] like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits [[diffusion]]; it keeps all of the necessary [[catalysts]] in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment.

'''The first self:''' Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and [[death]]. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a [[biological function]]. The internal reaction network functions to create the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be [[abiotic]] but together they create a system with a [[normative]] status dependent on the functioning of its component parts.

&lt;!--
======Autogenesis and Autopoesis======
Deacon's model of an autogen bears a striking resemblance to the [[autopoesis|autopoetic]] theory proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Fransisco Varela]] in 1973. However, Deacon takes pains to differentiate teleodynamics from autopoesis.

Deacon notes that autopoiesis is an update on the [[Kantian]] reciprocal production of parts conception of organisms. The problem with this approach is that is assumes the two most critical features necessary for life (and teleodynamics): (1) how the network of co-producing components is maintained as a "unity" in such a way that its coherent organization can be reconstituted or reproduced in a new system, and (2) how this unit "self" maintains itself far-from-equilibrium. [[Autopoiesis]] is an abstract description of what must be true of an organism, without outlining how these defining properties are accomplished. Indeed, as stated, [[autopoiesis]] describes morphodynamic processes, though without an account of the thermodyanamics involved. But morphodynamic processes don't spontaneously hold together, indeed, they are organized in a way that maximally destroys the conditions that produce them because they are entirely driven by extrinsic dynamics. Essentially, [[autopoesis]] is a description of the processes defining life, while autogenesis describes how they are dynamically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.

--&gt;

==Work==
As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of [[work (physics)|work]] Deacon seeks to generalize the [[Newtonian mechanics#Work and energy|Newtonian]] conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe "that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.365&lt;/ref&gt;  Work is generally described as "activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be "the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamic work===

A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top [[fluid]] at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both [[macroscopic]] and [[microscopic]] levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required.

===Morphodynamic work===

By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by [[classical thermodynamics]]. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Benard cell]] or the [[resonant frequency]] of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.

'''Resonance example:''' A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced [[resonance]] that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a [[resonant frequency]] that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.

'''Contragrade change:''' When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state.

'''Structure and form:''' Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the [[amplitude]] of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its [[frequency]]. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work.

===Teleodynamic work===

Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to [[Healing|heal]], to [[Reproduction|reproduce]] and to pursue resources towards these ends.  Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. 
[[File:Reading 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1682–1754).]]

'''Evolution as work:''' [[Natural selection]], or perhaps more accurately, [[adaptation]], can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist.

For example, in a population of New Zealand [[wrybill]] who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the [[wrybill]]s in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work.

'''Thought as work:''' Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. "The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to ''be'' evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg 550&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergent causal powers====

By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims "we can begin to discern ''a basis for a form of causal openness'' in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg.379&lt;/ref&gt; While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying [[quantum mechanics]] but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common.

==Information==
One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological [[information]]. The first formal [[Information Theory|theory of information]] was articulated by [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1948 in his work [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the [[information age]], but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[reference]], i.e., what the information is ''about.'' As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like [[computers]], it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions.

===Shannon information===
Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[information]]. [[Entropy]] is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. 
[[File:Information Shannon Boltzmann Darwin.jpg|thumb|500px|Three nested conceptions of information]]

===Boltzmann entropy===
Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic [[thermodynamic]] conception of entropy developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend.

===Significant information===
Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. "The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flint-knapping Demonstration (27349458154).jpg|thumb|Flintknapping a stone tool]]
'''Knapping''' is the shaping of [[flint]], [[chert]], [[obsidian]] or other [[conchoidal fracture|conchoidal fracturing]] stone through the process of [[lithic reduction]] to manufacture [[stone tool]]s, strikers for [[flintlock]] firearms, or to produce flat-faced stones for building or facing walls, and [[flushwork]] decoration. The original Germanic term "knopp" meant strike, shape, or work, so it could theoretically have referred equally well to making a statue or dice. Modern usage is more specific, referring almost exclusively to the hand-tool pressure-flaking process pictured.

== Method ==
{{main article|Lithic reduction}}
[[File:Knapping.JPG|thumb|upright|A leather leg guard protects the knapper from being injured by the edges of the flint]]
Flintknapping or knapping is done in a variety of ways depending on the purpose of the final product. For stone tools and flintlock strikers, chert is worked using a fabricator such as a [[hammerstone]] to remove [[lithic flake]]s from a nucleus or [[lithic core|core]] of [[tool stone]]. Stone tools can then be further refined using wood, bone, and antler tools to perform [[pressure flaking]].

For building work a hammer or pick is used to split chert nodules supported on the lap. Often the chert nodule will be split in half to create two cherts with a flat circular face for use in walls constructed of lime. More sophisticated knapping is employed to produce near-perfect cubes which are used as bricks.

=== Tools ===
There are many different methods of shaping stone into useful tools. Early knappers could have used simple hammers made of wood or antler to shape stone tools. The factors that contribute to the knapping results are varied, but the EPA (exterior platform angle) indeed influences many attributes, such as length, thickness and termination of flakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dibble|first1=Harold|last2=Whittaker|first2=John|title=New Experimental Evidence on the Relation Between Percussion Flaking and Flake Variation|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1981|volume=8|pages=283–296|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(81)90004-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305440381900042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hard hammer'' techniques are used to remove large flakes of stone. Early knappers and hobbyists replicating their methods often use cobbles of very hard stone, such as quartzite. This technique can be used by flintknappers to remove broad flakes that can be made into smaller tools. This method of manufacture is believed to have been used to make some of the earliest stone tools ever found, some of which date from over 2 million years ago.
[[File:Soft Hammer.jpg|thumb|left|Soft hammer knapping]]
''Soft hammer'' techniques are more precise than hard hammer methods of shaping stone. Soft hammer techniques allow a knapper to shape a stone into many different kinds of cutting, scraping, and projectile tools. These "soft hammer" techniques also produce longer, thinner flakes, potentially allowing for material conservation or a lighter lithic tool kit to be carried by mobile societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peclin|first1=Andrew|title=The Effect of Indentor Type on Flake Attributes: Evidence from a Controlled Experiment|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1997|volume=24|pages=613–621|doi=10.1006/jasc.1996.0145|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440396901454#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pressure flaking'' involves removing narrow flakes along the edge of a stone tool. This technique is often used to do detailed thinning and shaping of a stone tool. Pressure flaking involves putting a large amount of force across a region on the edge of the tool and (hopefully) causing a narrow flake to come off of the stone. Modern hobbyists often use pressure flaking tools with a copper or brass tip, but early knappers could have used antler tines or a pointed wooden punch; traditionalist knappers still use antler tines and copper-tipped tools. The major advantage of using soft metals rather than wood or bone is that the metal punches wear down less and are less likely to break under pressure.

[[File:Steinschloss.jpg|thumb|right|A gun-flint mounted in the jaws of a flintlock musket]]
In cultures that have not adopted metalworking technologies, the production of stone tools by knappers is common, but in modern cultures the making of such tools is the domain of [[experimental archaeology|experimental archaeologists]] and hobbyists. [[Archaeologist]]s usually undertake the task so that they can better understand how prehistoric [[stone tool]]s were made.

Knapping is often learned by outdoorsmen.

Knapping ''gun flints'', used by [[Flintlock mechanism|flintlock firearms]] was formerly a major industry in flint bearing locations, such as [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]] in [[Suffolk]], England and the small towns of [[Meusnes]] and [[Couffy]] in France.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt; Meusnes has a small museum dedicated to the industry.

In 1804, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Brandon was supplying over 400,000 flints a month for use by the British Army and Navy.&lt;ref name="whittaker"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.grinnell.edu/anthropology/Faculty/JohnWhittaker/Articles/2001_The_Oldest_British.pdf | title=The Oldest British Industry: continuity and obsolescence in a flintknapper's sample set | author=Whittaker, John | journal=Antiquity | year=2001 | volume=75 | pages=382–90 | doi=10.1017/s0003598x00061032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandon knappers made gun flints for export to Africa as late as the 1960s.

Knapping for building purposes is still a skill that is practiced in the flint-bearing regions of southern England, such as [[Sussex]], Suffolk and [[Norfolk]], and in northern France, especially [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]], where there is a resurgence of the craft due to government funding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flintknapping.co.uk/arch.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health hazards==
Historically, flint knappers commonly suffered from [[silicosis]], due to the inhalation of flint dust. This has been called "the world's first [[Occupational disease|industrial disease]]".&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ancientcraft.co.uk/Flintknapping/Flintknapping.html#Health | title=Basic Tool Production Techniques, Health and Safety| publisher=ancientcrafts.co.uk | accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pugetsound"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pugetsoundknappers.com/interesting_stuff/knapping_silicosis_article.html | title=FLlNTKNAPPING AND SILICOSIS | publisher=Pudget Sound Knappers | date=2010 | accessdate=24 August 2015 | author=Kalin, Jeffery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When gun flint knapping was a large-scale industry in Brandon, silicosis was widely known as ''knappers' rot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Knapper's Rot, Silicosis in East Anglian Flint Knappers | author=Batty Shaw, A | journal=Medical History | year=1981 | volume=25 | pages=151–168 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300034359 | pmid=7012479 | pmc=1139012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed silicosis was responsible for the early death of three-quarters of Brandon gun flint makers. In one workshop, seven of the eight workmen died of the condition before the age of fifty.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt;

Modern knappers are advised to work in the open air to reduce the dust hazard, and to wear eye and hand protection.&lt;ref name="ancientcrafts" /&gt; Some modern knappers wear a [[respirator]] to guard against dust.&lt;ref name="pugetsound" /&gt;

== Contemporary study ==
[[File:Enseñando a tallar.jpg|thumb|150px|right|French prehistorian [[Jacques Tixier]] offers modern training in stone knapping.]] 
Modern American interest in knapping can be traced back &lt;ref&gt;Whittaker 1994:56-58&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of a [[California]] Native American called [[Ishi]] who lived in the early twentieth century. Ishi taught scholars and academics traditional methods of making stone tools and how to use them for survival in the wild. Early European explorers to the New world were also exposed to flint knapping techniques. Additionally, several pioneering nineteenth-century European experimental knappers are also known and in the late 1960s and early 1970s experimental archaeologist [[Don Crabtree]] published texts such as "Experiments in Flintworking". [[François Bordes]] was an early writer on [[Old World]] knapping; he experimented with ways to replicate stone tools found across [[Western Europe]]. These authors helped to ignite a small craze in knapping among archaeologists and prehistorians.

English archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] is another contemporary expert, whose exposure on the television series [[Time Team]] has led to him being a familiar figure in the UK and beyond. Many groups, with members from all walks of life, can now be found across the United States and Europe. These organizations continue to demonstrate and teach various ways of shaping stone tools.

The '''level of support for evolution''' among scientists, the public and other groups is a topic that frequently arises in the [[creation-evolution controversy]] and touches on educational, religious, philosophical, scientific and political issues. The subject is especially contentious in countries where significant levels of non-acceptance of evolution by general society exist although [[evolution]] is taught at school and university.

Nearly all (around 97%) of the scientific community accepts evolution as the dominant scientific theory of biological diversity.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |title=Finding evolution in medicine |journal=NIH Record |volume=58 |issue=15 |accessdate=2007-10-22 |date=2006-07-28 |format=hmtl |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific associations have strongly rebutted and refuted the challenges to evolution proposed by [[intelligent design]] proponents.&lt;ref name="dover_pg83"&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

In 1986, an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief, signed by 72 US Nobel Prize winners, 17 state academies of science and 7 other scientific societies, asked the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'', to reject a [[Louisiana]] state law requiring that where evolutionary science was taught in public schools, creation science must also be taught. The brief also stated that the term "creation science" as used by the law embodied religious dogma, and that "teaching religious ideas mislabeled as science is detrimental to scientific education".&lt;ref name=amicus&gt;Amicus Curiae brief in {{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

There are many scientific and scholarly organizations from around the world that have issued statements in support of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/science List of numerous US scientific societies that support evolution and their statements about evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsu.org/Gestion/img/ICSU_DOC_DOWNLOAD/1017_DD_FILE_IAP_Evolution.pdf List of 68 international scientific societies on the Interacademy Panel (IAP) that endorse a resolution supporting evolution and a multibillion year old earth, June 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/1999/nsb99149/nsb99149.txt National Science Board letter in support of evolution 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298 ''Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design'', 11 Apr 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the world's largest general scientific society with more than 130,000 members and over 262 affiliated societies and academies of science including over 10 million individuals, has made several statements and issued several press releases in support of evolution.&lt;ref name="AAAS Denounces Anti-Evolution Laws"/&gt; The prestigious [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], which provides science advice to the nation, has published several books supporting evolution and criticising creationism and intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/html/creationism/ ''Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition'', National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071117073919/http://orsted.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5787&amp;page=R1 ''Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science (1998)'', National Academy of Sciences, National Academy Press, Washington DC, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a notable difference between the opinion of scientists and that of the general public in the United States. A 2009 poll by [[Pew Research Center]] found that "Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time – 87% say evolution is due to natural processes, such as natural selection. The dominant position among scientists – that living things have evolved due to natural processes – is shared by only about a third (32%) of the public."&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[[Pew Research Center]]: "[http://people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/ Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media]" July 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Votes, resolutions and statements of scientists before 1985===
One of the earliest resolutions in support of evolution was issued by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1922, and readopted in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.aaas.org/docs/resolutions.php?doc_id=450 ''AAAS Resolution: Present Scientific Status of the Theory of Evolution''], [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Adopted by the AAAS Council, December 26, 1922. AAAS Executive Committee readopts this resolution on April 21, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm ''The Imminent Demise of Evolution: The Longest Running Falsehood in Creationism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207173612/http://home.entouch.net/dmd/moreandmore.htm |date=2009-02-07 }}, G. R. Morton, Copyright 2002 G.R. Morton&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early effort to express support for evolution by scientists was organized by Nobel Prize–winning American biologist [[Hermann J. Muller]] in 1966. Muller circulated a petition entitled "Is Biological Evolution a Principle of Nature that has been well established by Science?" in May 1966:

{{quotation|There are no hypotheses, alternative to the principle of evolution with its "tree of life," that any competent biologist of today takes seriously. Moreover, the principle is so important for an understanding of the world we live in and of ourselves that the public in general, including students taking biology in high school, should be made aware of it, and of the fact that it is firmly established, even as the rotundity of the earth is firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Bales, James D., ''Forty-Two Years on the Firing Line'', Lambert, Shreveport, LA, p.71-72, no date.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This manifesto was signed by 177 of the leading American biologists, including [[George Gaylord Simpson|George G. Simpson]] of [[Harvard University]], Nobel Prize Winner [[Peter Agre]] of [[Duke University]], [[Carl Sagan]] of [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[John Tyler Bonner]] of [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Nobel Prize Winner [[George Beadle]], President of the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Donald Kennedy|Donald F. Kennedy]] of [[Stanford University]], formerly head of the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=DayScientistsVoted&gt;[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/1981 ''The Day the Scientists Voted'', Bert Thompson, Apologetics Press: Sensible Science, 2001, originally published in Reason &amp; Revelation, 2(3):9-11, March 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the passing of a resolution by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) in the fall of 1972 that stated, in part, "the theory of creation ... is neither scientifically grounded nor capable of performing the rules required of science theories".&lt;ref name=ABT&gt;American Biology Teacher, January 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] also passed a similar resolution in the fall of 1972.&lt;ref name=ABT/&gt; A statement on evolution called "A Statement Affirming Evolution as a Principle of Science." was signed by Nobel Prize Winner [[Linus Pauling]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[George Gaylord Simpson|George G. Simpson]], Caltech Biology Professor [[Norman H. Horowitz]], [[Ernst Mayr]], and others, and published in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''A Statement Affirming Evolution as a Principle of Science,'' The Humanist, January/February, 1977, p. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing board of the [[American Geological Institute]] issued a statement supporting resolution in November 1981.&lt;ref&gt;AAPG Explorer, January, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] passed another resolution supporting evolution and disparaging efforts to teach [[creationism]] in science classes.&lt;ref&gt;''"Creation-Science" Law Is Struck Down,'' Raloff, J., Science News, 121[2]:20, January 9, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, there are no scientifically peer-reviewed research articles that disclaim evolution listed in the scientific and medical journal search engine [[Pubmed]].&lt;ref name="pmid16670753"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Attie AD | title=Defending science education against intelligent design: a call to action | journal=J Clin Invest | date= 2006 | volume= 116 | issue= 5 | pages= 1134–8 | pmid=16670753 | doi=10.1172/JCI28449 | pmc=1451210 |name-list-format=vanc| author2=Sober E | author3=Numbers RL | author4=Amasino RM | author5=Cox B | author6=Berceau T | display-authors=6 | last7=Powell | first7=T | last8=Cox | first8=MM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Steve===
{{main|Project Steve}}
The [[Discovery Institute]] announced that over 700 scientists had expressed support for [[intelligent design]] as of February 8, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/few_biologists.html (''Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition'', Panda's Thumb, February 21, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213221402/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/02/few_biologists.html |date=December 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the [[National Center for Science Education]] to produce a "light-hearted" [[petition]] called "[[Project Steve]]" in support of [[evolution]]. Only scientists named "Steve" or some variation (such as Stephen, Stephanie, and Stefan) are eligible to sign the petition. It is intended to be a "tongue-in-cheek [[parody]]" of the lists of alleged "scientists" supposedly supporting [[creationist]] principles that creationist organizations produce.&lt;ref name=steve&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve National Center for Science Education "Project Steve"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/#presentsci List of living scientists who accept the biblical account of creation] from [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; The petition demonstrates that there are more scientists who accept evolution with a name like "Steve" alone (over 1370&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/list-steves The List of Steves]&lt;/ref&gt;) than there are in total who support intelligent design.

Many creationists act as [[Evangelism|evangelists]] and their organizations are registered as tax-free religious organizations.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion about some controversy about this, see [[Kent Hovind]].&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists have claimed that they represent the interests of true Christians, and evolution is associated only with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, in his book [http://www.errantskeptics.org/Quotes_Regarding_Creation_Evolution.htm ''Systematic Theology''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224164219/http://www.errantskeptics.org/Quotes_Regarding_Creation_Evolution.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}, Charles Hodge, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co, 1975, vol. 2, p. 15, argues that "''First, it shocks the common sense of unsophisticated men to be told that the whale and the humming-bird, man and the mosquito, are derived from the same source... the system is thoroughly atheistic, and therefore cannot possibly stand.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/21soc03.htm#top ''Evolution and Christianity are opposites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021232820/http://www.pathlights.com/ce_encyclopedia/21soc03.htm |date=2006-10-21 }}, p. 36 of ''Evolution and Society'', Volume 2 of ''Scientific Facts Against Evolution-Origin of the Universe: 3 Volume Encyclopedia'' states, of evolution and Christianity, "''there can be no reconciliation between the two. One view stands for fighting, warfare against the supposed weaker ones, and atheism; the other is for peace, self-sacrifice for the good of others, and belief and trust in the Creator God...Even evolutionists and atheists have declared that their creeds are totally different than those of Christianity.''" Also in the article ''Evolution and the churches'' on pages 39-41 of the same volume, "''In spite of clear-cut statements by evolutionists that "evolution IS atheism," many denominations today accept one form or another of evolutionary theory.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all religious organizations find support for evolution incompatible with their religious faith. For example, 12 of the plaintiffs opposing the teaching of [[creation science]] in the influential ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' court case were clergy representing Methodist, Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal, Catholic, Southern Baptist, Reform Jewish, and Presbyterian groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2243 McLean v Arkansas, Encyclopedia of Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several religious organizations that have issued statements advocating the teaching of evolution in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion ''Defending the teaching of evolution in public education, Statements from Religious Organizations'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr. [[Rowan Williams]], issued statements in support of evolution in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/21/archbishop_backs_evolution/ ''Archbishop of Canterbury backs evolution: Well, he is a Primate,'' Chris Williams, The Register, Tuesday 21 March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]] is a signed statement by 12,808 (as of 28 May 2012) American Christian clergy of different denominations rejecting creationism organized in 2004. Molleen Matsumura of the [[National Center for Science Education]] found, of Americans in the twelve largest Christian denominations, at least 77% belong to churches that support evolution education (and that at one point, this figure was as high as 89.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1998|p=9}} notes that, "''Table 1 demonstrates that Americans in the 12 largest Christian denominations, 89.6% belong to churches that support evolution education! Indeed, many of the statements in ''Voices'' insist quite strongly that evolution must be included in science education and "creation science" must be excluded. Even if we subtract the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], which has changed its view of evolution since [[McLean v Arkansas]] and might take a different position now, the percentage those in denominations supporting evolution is still a substantial 77%. Furthermore, many other Christian and non-Christian denominations, including the [[United Church of Christ]] and the National Sikh Center, have shown some degree of support for evolution education (as defined by inclusion in 'Voices' or the "Joint Statement").''" Matsumura produced her table from a June, 1998 article titled ''Believers: Dynamic Dozen'' put out by Religion News Services which in turn cites the ''1998 Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches''. Matsurmura's calculations include the [[Southern Baptist Convention|SBC]] based on a brief they filed in [[McLean v. Arkansas]], where the SBC took a position it has since changed, according to Matsurmura. See also {{harvnb|NCSE|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These religious groups include the [[Catholic Church]], as well as various denominations of Protestantism, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention, USA]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[National Baptist Convention of America]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/schrock/docs/Eagle-25.pdf ''Christianity, Evolution Not in Conflict'', John Richard Schrock, Wichita Eagle May 17, 2005 page 17A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921030214/http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/schrock/docs/Eagle-25.pdf |date=September 21, 2006 }}&lt;!-- This editorial mischaracterizes the Matsurmura|1998 article--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1998|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figure closer to about 71% is presented by the analysis of Walter B.

[[Michael Shermer]] argued in Scientific American in October 2006 that evolution supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes and the rule of law. Shermer also suggests that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010052848/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00068F43-E189-150E-A18983414B7F0000&amp;colID=13 ''Darwin on the Right: Why Christians and conservatives should accept evolution''], Michael Shermer, Scientific American, October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and Ahmadiyya===
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya views of evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Movement universally accepts evolution and actively promotes it. [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] has stated in his magnum opus ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge &amp; Truth]]'' that evolution did occur but only through [[God]] being the One who brings it about. It does not occur itself, according to the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]. The Ahmadis do not believe [[Adam]] was the first human on earth, but merely the first prophet to receive a [[revelation]] of God.

===Evolution and the Baha'i Faith===
{{main article|Bahá'í Faith and science#Evolution}}
A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The [[seed]] does not at once become a [[tree]]; the [[embryo]] does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}}

===Evolution and the Catholic Church===
The 1950 encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'' advocated scepticism towards evolution without explicitly rejecting it; this was substantially amended by Pope John-Paul II in 1996 in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in which he said, "Today, almost half a century after publication of the encyclical, new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, Speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, October 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2002 the [[International Theological Commission]] found that "Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html "Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621050711/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040723_communion-stewardship_en.html |date=June 21, 2014 }}, [[International Theological Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was published by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on July 2004 by the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger (who became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) who was the president of the Commission at the time.

The [[Magisterium]] has not made an authoritative statement on intelligent design, and has permitted arguments on both sides of the issue. In 2005, Cardinal [[Christoph Schönborn]] of Vienna appeared to endorse intelligent design when he denounced philosophically materialist interpretations of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Heneghan. "Catholics and Evolution: Interview with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn", ''BeliefNet'', Jan. 5, 2006 [http://www.beliefnet.com/story/182/story_18220_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In an op-ed in the [[New York Times]] he said "Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense - an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection - is not."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/opinion/07schonborn.html] Finding Design in Nature by Christoph Schönborn&lt;/ref&gt; This common line of reasoning among fundamentalist theologians is flawed, as evolution by natural selection is not random at all; only mutations occur in a stochastic manner, while natural selection establishes genes which aid survival in a particular environment.

In the January 16&amp;ndash;17 2006 edition of the official [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', [[University of Bologna]] evolutionary biology Professor [[Fiorenzo Facchini]] wrote an article agreeing with the judge's ruling in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'' and stating that [[intelligent design]] was unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2006/01/intelligent-design-criticized-vatican-newspaper-00975 ''"Intelligent design" criticized in Vatican newspaper''], [[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] article, January 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/science/sciencespecial2/19evolution.html?ex=1295326800&amp;en=62dc61ea5d27e73d&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss ''In "Design" vs. Darwinism, Darwin Wins Point in Rome''], Ian Fisher and Cornelia Dean, New York Times, January 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesuit]] Father [[George Coyne]], former director of the [[Vatican Observatory]], has also denounced intelligent design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18503 ''Intelligent Design belittles God, Vatican director says''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323080822/http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18503 |date=March 23, 2013 }}, Mark Lombard, 1/30/2006, Catholic Online&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and Hinduism===
{{Main article|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindus believe in the concept of evolution of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msu.edu/~hernan94] Dave Hernandez - Michigan State University&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of [[Dashavatara]]&amp;mdash;different incarnations of God starting from simple organisms and progressively becoming complex beings&amp;mdash;and [[Religious views of evolution#Day and night of Brahma|Day and Night of Brahma]] are generally cited as instances of Hindu acceptance of evolution.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===US religious denominations that dispute evolution===
In the United States, many Protestant denominations promote creationism, preach against evolution, and sponsor lectures and debates on the subject. Denominations that explicitly advocate creationism instead of evolution or "Darwinism" include the [[Assemblies of God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GCAG|1977}}, General Council of the Assemblies of Godofficial assertion of creationism&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} the [[Free Methodist Church]], [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|2001|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=December 2016}} [[Pentecostal Churches]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]es,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Official Seventh-day Adventist belief statement advocating creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], [[Southern Baptist Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=967 Southern Baptist Convention Resolution on Creationism]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oneness Pentecostal|Pentecostal Oneness churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.regis.edu/mghedott/evolut.htm Prof. Michael J.

==Support for evolution in medicine and industry==
A common complaint of [[creationist]]s is that evolution is of no value, has never been used for anything, and will never be of any use. According to many creationists, nothing would be lost by getting rid of evolution, and science and industry might even benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=252 | title = Evolution - Useful or Useless? | first = George | last = Lindsey | journal = Impact | volume = #148 |date=1985-10-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |format = asp | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/evolution.asp | title = Evolution and practical science | first = Carl | last = Wieland | journal = Creation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 4 |date=1999-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |format = asp | ref = harv |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104420/http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/evolution.asp |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v20/i4/french.asp | title = French creation interview with French scientist Dr André Eggen | first = Ken | last = Ham | journal = Creation | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 17–19 |date=1998-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 | format = asp | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, evolution is being put to practical use in industry and widely used on a daily basis by researchers in [[medicine]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], and [[genetics]] to both formulate hypotheses about biological systems for the purposes of experimental design, as well as to rationalise observed data and prepare applications.&lt;ref name=nihrecord/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, George |author2=Nesse, Randolph M. |title=Why we get sick: the new science of Darwinian medicine |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-679-74674-4 |oclc= |doi= |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=applications&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA215.html | title = Index to Creationist claims: Claim CA215 | work = [[TalkOrigins Archive]] | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |date=2005-10-04 | last = Isaak | first = Mark (ed.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindell&gt;{{cite book |author=Mindell, David A. |title=The evolving world: evolution in everyday life |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |date=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-674-02191-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2017 there are 487,558 scientific papers in [[PubMed]] that mention 'evolution'.&lt;ref name=pubmed&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=evolution | title = NCBI PubMed | work = [[PubMed]] | accessdate = 2012-06-25 | date = 2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical companies utilize biological evolution in their development of new products, and also use these medicines to combat evolving bacteria and viruses.&lt;ref name=applications/&gt;

Because of the perceived value of evolution in applications, there have been some expressions of support for evolution on the part of [[corporations]]. In [[Kansas]], there has been some widespread concern in the corporate and academic communities that a move to weaken the teaching of evolution in schools will hurt the state's ability to recruit the best talent, particularly in the [[biotech]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/265482/do_scientists_see_kansas_missouri_as_antiscience | title = Do Scientists See Kansas, Missouri As 'Anti-Science'? | first = Jason | last = Gertzen |author2=Stafford, Diane  | work = The Kansas City Star |date=2005-10-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117074042/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/265482/do_scientists_see_kansas_missouri_as_antiscience |archivedate = November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hanle of the [[Biotechnology Institute]] warned that the [[United States]] risks falling behind in the [[biotechnology]] race with other nations if it does not do a better job of teaching [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901628.html ''Waging War on Evolution,'' Paul A.

Furthermore, McCarter concluded that 47 of the last 50 Nobel Prizes in medicine or physiology depended on an understanding of evolutionary theory (according to McCarter's unspecified personal criteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ncse.com/rncse/25/3-4/evolution-is-winner-breakthroughs-prizes | format = asp | title = Evolution is a Winner - for Breakthroughs and Prizes | first = James | last = McCarter | work = National Center for Science Education | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}; originally published in the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], 2005-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other support for evolution==
There are also many educational organizations that have issued statements in support of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/education List of educational organizations that support evolution and their statements about evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, creationist beliefs (or a lack of support for evolutionary theory) are relatively widespread, even garnering a majority of public opinion. A study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' compared attitudes about evolution in the United States, 32 European countries (including Turkey) and [[Japan]]. The only country where acceptance of evolution was lower than in the United States was [[Turkey]] (25%). Public acceptance of evolution was most widespread (at over 80% of the population) in [[Iceland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=ScienceSurvey&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=11 August 2006 |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=765&amp;ndash;766 |title=Public Acceptance of Evolution |author1=Jon D.

=== India ===
Among those who had heard of Charles Darwin and knew something about the theory of evolution, 77% of people in India agree that enough scientific evidence exists to support Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.&lt;ref name="ncse India"&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/opinions-evolution-from-ten-countries-004885 Opinions on evolution from ten countries] July 2nd, 2009, [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2009/07/darwin-and-unnatural-disbelief.html Darwin and unnatural disbelief] July 1, 2009. Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 85% of God believing Indians who know about evolution agree that life on earth evolved over time as a result of natural selection.&lt;ref name="ncse India"/&gt;

In a survey carried among 10 major nations, the highest proportion that agreed that evolutionary theories alone should be taught in schools was in India, at 49%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/8322781.stm Darwin teaching 'divides opinion'] [[BBC News]]; Monday, 26 October 2009.

Highest acceptence was found in Delhi, Maharashtra and Kerala (all above 78%) while the least was found to be in Haryana (41.3%). Males were marginally more likely to accept the evolution compared with females (72% vs. 69%), and non-religious people compared with religious people (74% vs. 67%). Surprisingly people who identified as ‘rightists’ accepted the evolution more than those who identified themselves as ‘leftists’ (66% vs. 61%) in political spectra. The study also identified teachers and students (over 73%) as most likely to accept evolution while employed adults (59%) least. While at the international level, the trend is quite clear that religiosity is inversely proportional to public acceptance of evolution, situation in India was strikingly opposite. Lead author, Dr. [[Felix Bast]] from [[Central University of Punjab]] conjectured possible reason for high public acceptance of evolution in India despite the fact of high religiosity is that Hinduism does not conflict Darwin’s theory of evolution to a large extent. According to [[2011 Census of India|2011 census]], Hindus encompass 80.3% of Indian population. Many concepts of Vedas and Hinduism support the scientific consensus of geology, climate science and evolution to a large extent. For example, according to Rigveda, the age of earth is 1.97 billion years, which is very old compared with that of creation myth propounded by Abrahamic religions (according to creationism-also called Intelligent Design, the age of earth is around 6000 years). Current scientific consensus of the age of earth is 4.543 billion years. A number of evolutionary biologists in the past as well were baffled about the surprising similarity between evolutionary theory and Hinduism. British evolutionary biologist JBS Haldane, for instance, suggested that Hindu concept of ''dashavatara''- the ten incarnations of lord Vishnu- is a rough idea of vertebrate evolution (fish-the vertebrate to tortoise-reptile to boar-mammal to man). Vedic concepts of ''pralaya'' and ''mahapralaya'' too surprisingly capture the cyclic nature of global climate (glacial-interglacial cycles).

===United States===
US courts have ruled in favor of teaching evolution in science classrooms, and against teaching creationism, in numerous cases such as [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], [[Hendren v. Campbell]], [[McLean v. Arkansas]] and [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]].

A prominent organization in the United States behind the [[intelligent design movement]] is the  Discovery Institute, which, through its [[Center for Science and Culture]], conducts a number of [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|public relations and lobbying campaigns]] aimed at influencing the public and policy makers in order to advance its position in [[academia]]. The [[Discovery Institute]] claims that because there is a significant lack of [[Argumentum ad populum|public support]] for evolution, that [[creation and evolution in public education|public schools]] should, as their campaign states, "[[Teach the Controversy]]", although there is no controversy over the validity of evolution within the scientific community.

A 2005 Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of evangelical Christians believed that living organisms have not changed since their creation, but only 31% of Catholics and 32% of mainline Protestants shared this opinion. A 2005 Harris Poll&lt;ref name=Harrispoll&gt;[http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 ''Nearly Two-thirds of U.S. Adults Believe Human Beings Were Created by God''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217080148/http://harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=581 |date=2005-12-17 }}, The Harris Poll #52, July 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that 63% of liberals and 37% of conservatives agreed that humans and other primates have a common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;

=== Uruguay ===
According to a 2014 poll produced by the Pew Research Center, 74% of people in Uruguay believe "humans and other living things evolved over time" while 20% believe they have "always existed in the present form."&lt;ref name="PewLatinAmerica" /&gt;

According to a 2014 poll by the Pew Research Center, 63% of people in Venezuela believe "humans and other living things evolved over time" while 33% believe they have "always existed in the present form."&lt;ref name="PewLatinAmerica" /&gt;

== Trends ==
The level of assent that evolution garners has changed with time. The trends in acceptance of evolution can be estimated.

===Early impact of Darwin's theory===
The level of support for evolution in different communities has varied with time. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory had convinced almost every naturalist within 20 years of its publication in 1858, and was making serious inroads with the public and the more liberal clergy. It had reached such extremes, that by 1880, one
American religious weekly publication estimated that "perhaps a quarter, perhaps a half of the educated ministers in our leading Evangelical denominations" felt "that the story of the creation and fall of man, told in Genesis, is no more the record of actual occurrences than is the parable of the Prodigal Son."&lt;ref name=Numbers&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070621033807/http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/NUMCRX_excerpt.pdf ''The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, expanded edition'', Ronald L. Numbers, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England, 2006] {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, many of the most conservative Christians accepted an ancient earth, and life on earth before Eden. [[Victorian Era]] Creationists were more akin to people who subscribe to [[theistic evolution]] today. Even fervent anti-evolutionist [[Scopes Trial]] prosecutor [[William Jennings Bryan]] interpreted the "days" of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as ages of the earth, and acknowledged that biochemical evolution took place, drawing the line only at the story of [[Adam and Eve]]'s creation. Prominent pre-World War II creationist [[Harry Rimmer]] allowed an [[Old Earth Creationist|Old Earth]] by slipping millions of years into putative gaps in the Genesis account, and claimed that the [[Noachian Flood]] was only a local phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

In the decades of the 20th century, [[George McCready Price]] and a tiny group of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] followers were among the very few believers in a [[Young Earth Creationism|Young Earth]] and a worldwide flood, which Price championed in his "new catastrophism" theories. It was not until the publication of [[John C. Whitcomb, Jr.]], and [[Henry M. Morris]]’s book ''Genesis Flood'' in 1961 that Price's idea was revived. In the last few decades, many creationists have adopted Price's beliefs, becoming progressively more strict [[biblical literalists]].&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2015}}

===Recent public beliefs===
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
In a 1991 Gallup poll, 47% of the US population, and 25% of college graduates agreed with the statement, "God created man pretty much in his present form at one time within the last 10,000 years."

Fourteen years
later, in 2005, Gallup found that 53% of Americans expressed the belief that "God created human beings in their present form exactly the way the Bible describes it." About 2/3 (65.5%) of those surveyed thought that creationism was definitely or probably true. In 2005 a [[Newsweek]] poll discovered that 80 percent of the American public thought that "God created the universe." and the Pew Research Center reported that "nearly two-thirds of Americans say that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in public schools." [[Ronald Numbers]] commented on that with "Most surprising of all was the discovery that large numbers of high-school biology teachers — from 30% in Illinois and 38% in Ohio to a whopping 69% in Kentucky — supported the teaching of creationism."&lt;ref name=Numbers/&gt;

The [[National Center for Science Education]] reports that from 1985 to 2005, the number of Americans unsure about evolution increased from 7% to 21%, while the number rejecting evolution declined from 48% to 39%.&lt;ref name=ScienceSurvey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hecht&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9786 Why doesn't America believe in evolution?, Jeff Hecht, New Scientist, 20 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Miller of Michigan State University has found in his polls that the number of Americans who accept evolution has declined from 45% to 40% from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Science, vol 313, p 765&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of these somewhat contradictory results, it is difficult to know for sure what is happening to public opinion on evolution in the US. It does not appear that either side is making unequivocal progress. It does appear that uncertainty about the issue is increasing, however.

Anecdotal evidence is that creationism is becoming more of an issue in the UK as well. One report in 2006 was that UK students are increasingly arriving ill-prepared to participate in medical studies or other advanced education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,1714171,00.html ''Academics fight rise of creationism at universities: More students believe Darwin got it wrong, Royal Society challenges "insidious problem"''], Duncan Campbell, The Guardian, Tuesday February 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent scientific trends===
The level of support for [[creationism]] among relevant scientists is minimal. In 2007 the [[Discovery Institute]] reported that about 600 scientists signed their ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism|A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]'' list, up from 100 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=2732 | title = Ranks of Scientists Doubting Darwin's Theory on the Rise | author = Staff, [[Discovery Institute]] | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] |date=2007-03-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual statement of the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism is a relatively mild one that expresses skepticism about the absoluteness of 'Darwinism' (and is in line with the [[falsifiability]] required of [[Theory#Science|scientific theories]]) to explain all features of life, and does not in any way represent an absolute denial or rejection of evolution.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ncse.com/creationism/general/doubting-darwinism-creative-license | title = Doubting Darwinism through Creative License | last = Evans | first = Skip | authorlink = Skip Evans | publisher = [[National Center for Science Education]] |date=2001-11-29 | accessdate = 2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a tongue-in-cheek response known as [[Project Steve]], a list restricted to scientists named Steve, Stephanie etc. who agree that evolution is "a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences," has 1,382 signatories {{As of|2015|11|24|alt=as of November 24, 2015}}.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve |title=Project Steve  |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=November 24, 2015 |date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with these names make up approximately 1% of the total U.S. population.

The United States [[National Science Foundation]] statistics on US yearly science graduates demonstrate that from 1987 to 2001, the number of biological science graduates increased by 59% while the number of geological science graduates decreased by 20.5%. However, the number of geology graduates in 2001 was only 5.4% of the number of graduates in the biological sciences, while it was 10.7% of the number of biological science graduates in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf04311/pdf/tab42.pdf | title = NSF statistics on science graduates 1966&amp;ndash;2001 | publisher = National Science Foundation | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109070632/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf04311/pdf/tab42.pdf | archivedate = 2006-11-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Resources Statistics Division of the National Science Foundation estimated that in 1999, there were 955,300 biological scientists in the US (about 1/3 of who hold graduate degrees). There were also 152,800 earth scientists in the US as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://srsstats.sbe.nsf.gov/preformatted-tables/1999/tables/TableC1.pdf | title = 1999 SESTAT (Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data) Table C-1 | publisher = National Science Foundation/Science Resources Statistics Division | format = pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060929135233/http://srsstats.sbe.nsf.gov/preformatted-tables/1999/tables/TableC1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large fraction of the Darwin Dissenters have specialties unrelated to research on evolution; of the dissenters, three-quarters are not biologists.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | title = Few Biologists But Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition | first = Kenneth | last = Chang | publisher = The [[New York Times]] |date=2006-03-21 | format = php }}; text available without registering at {{cite web | url = http://www.ntskeptics.org/news/news2006-02-25.htm | title = Skeptical News }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, the dissenter list was expanded to include non-US scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/06/dissent_from_darwinism_goes_gl.html | last = Crowther | first = Robert | publisher = [[Discovery Institute]] | title = Dissent From Darwinism 'Goes Global' as Over 600 Scientists Around the World Express Their Doubts About Darwinian Evolution | accessdate = 2007-10-30 |date=2006-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers are attempting to understand the factors that affect people's acceptance of evolution. Studies have yielded inconsistent results, explains associate professor of education at Ohio State University, David Haury. He recently performed a study that found people are likely to reject evolution if they have feelings of uncertainty, regardless of how well they understand evolutionary theory. Haury believes that teachers need to show students that their intuitive feelings may be misleading (for example, using the [[Wason selection task]]), and thus to exercise caution when relying on them as they judge the rational merits of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/tea.20449 | volume=49 | issue=1 | title=Feeling of certainty: Uncovering a missing link between knowledge and acceptance of evolution | year=2011 | journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching | pages=95–121 | last1 = Ha | first1 = Minsu| bibcode=2012JRScT..49...95H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/human/intuition-belief-evolution-120122.html Discovery News, "Belief in Evolution Boils Down to a Gut Feeling", Sun Jan 22, 2012 09:24 AM ET.

===Georgia===

Transcaucasian Trail:

A long distance trail in the caucasus has been a lingering idea for trekkers and hikers for many years since they started hiking remote parts of the Caucasus. 
Many sections of the TCT already exist, used by local community members and shepherds for centuries. These trail cross long valleys and traverse mammoth mountains to connect mountain villages together. Unfortunately, in recent years many of these trails have fallen into disrepair, and while many trails are known to locals, they are difficult to navigate for visitors and tourists. 
In 2015, two Peace Corps volunteers, Paul Stephens and Jeff Haack, mapped and charted known routes in The Republic of Georgia. During this time they succeeded in locating many connections between known trails and publicizing the concept of the trail. In 2016, Tom Allen and Alessandro Mambelli scouted new trail routes in Armenia while the first trail building project began in Svaneti, Georgia. In 2017, the trail building expanded to Dilijan National Park in Armenia while trail building continued in the Svaneti region. 
Today, over 300 km of trail has been improved and marked in Georgia and Armenia. Many 7-10 day guided hikes are available on the TCT this summer. Over the next 5 years, the trail will be expanded to connect all of the sections and create even longer hikes.
The TCT can serve many purposes in the Caucasus region. For one, the natural diversity of the area needs to be protected. This habitat fosters many species of animal and provides unique ecosystems created by the mountains. 
More information about the trail can be found at transcaucasiantrail.org . 
Donations can be sustaining or one-time.

'''Living systems''' are open self-organizing life forms that interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy]] and matter.

Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general living systems theory is required to explain the nature of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Woodruff | first = T. Sullivan | authorlink = |author2=John Baross  | title = Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = October 8, 2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}
Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." [...] "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems".&lt;/ref&gt; Such a general theory, arising out of the [[Ecology|ecological]] and [[Biology|biological sciences]], attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns, Flows, and Interrelationship |url=http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |accessdate=2009-06-27 |first=Molly Young |last=Brown |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108122526/http://www.mollyyoungbrown.com/systems_article.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their [[structure]], [[interaction]], [[behavior]] and [[developmental biology|development]]. This work is created by [[James Grier Miller]], which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Living Systems'', a "living system" must contain each of twenty "critical subsystems", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. In ''Living Systems'' Miller provides a detailed look at a number of systems in order of increasing size, and identifies his subsystems in each. 
Miller considers living systems as a subset of all [[system]]s. Below the level of living systems, he defines [[space]] and [[time]], [[matter]] and [[energy]], [[information]] and [[entropy]], levels of [[organization]], and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen, 1998, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Living systems according to Parent (1996) are by definition "open self-organizing [[system]]s that have the special characteristics of life and interact with their [[social environment|environment]]. This takes place by means of information and material-energy exchanges. Living systems can be as simple as a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] or as complex as a supranational [[organization]] such as the European Union. Regardless of their [[complexity]], they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Parent, [http://projects.isss.org/the_living_systems_theory_of_james_grier_miller ''The Living Systems Theory of James Grier Miller''], Primer project ISSS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller said that systems exist at eight "nested" hierarchical levels: cell, organ, organism, group, organization, community, society, and supranational system. At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary.

The processors of matter–energy are: 
* ingestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter

The processors of information are:
* input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer.

==Miller's living systems theory==
James Grier Miller in 1978 wrote a 1,102-page volume to present his living systems theory. He constructed a general theory of living [[system]]s by focusing on concrete systems—nonrandom accumulations of matter–energy in physical space–time organized into interacting, interrelated [[subsystem]]s or components. Slightly revising the original model a dozen years later, he distinguished eight "nested" hierarchical levels in such complex structures. Each level is "nested" in the sense that each higher level contains the next lower level in a nested fashion.

His central thesis is that the systems in existence at all eight levels are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] composed of twenty critical subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of various forms of matter–energy and information. Two of these subsystems—reproducer and boundary—process both matter–energy and information. Eight of them process only matter–energy. The other ten process information only. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All nature is a continuum. The endless complexity of life is organized into patterns which repeat themselves—theme and variations—at each level of system. These similarities and differences are proper concerns for science. From the ceaseless streaming of protoplasm to the many-vectored activities of supranational systems, there are continuous flows through living systems as they maintain their highly organized steady states.&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Seppänen (1998) says that Miller applied [[general systems theory]] on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.&lt;ref&gt;Seppänen 1998, pp. 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topics in living systems theory===
Miller's theory posits that the mutual interrelationship of the components of a system extends across the hierarchical levels. Examples: Cells and organs of a living system thrive on the food the organism obtains from its suprasystem; the member countries of a supranational system reap the benefits accrued from the communal activities to which each one contributes. Miller says that his eclectic theory "ties together past discoveries from many disciplines and provides an outline into which new findings can be fitted".&lt;ref&gt;(Miller, 1978, p. 1025)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and energy organized by information. Miller's theory of living systems employs two sorts of spaces: physical or geographical space, and conceptual or abstracted spaces. Time is the fundamental "fourth dimension" of the physical space–time continuum/spiral. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies physical space. Mass and energy are equivalent as one can be converted into the other. Information refers to the degrees of freedom that exist in a given situation to choose among signals, symbols, messages, or patterns to be transmitted.

Other relevant concepts are system, structure, process, type, level, echelon, suprasystem, subsystem, transmissions, and steady state. A system can be conceptual, concrete or abstracted. The structure of a system is the arrangement of the subsystems and their components in three-dimensional space at any point of time. Process, which can be reversible or irreversible, refers to change over time of matter–energy or information in a system. Type defines living systems with similar characteristics. Level is the position in a hierarchy of systems. Many complex living systems, at various levels, are organized into two or more echelons. The suprasystem of any living system is the next higher system in which it is a subsystem or component. The totality of all the structures in a system which carry out a particular process is a subsystem. Transmissions are inputs and outputs in concrete systems. Because living systems are open systems, with continually altering fluxes of matter–energy and information, many of their equilibria are dynamic—situations identified as steady states or flux equilibria.

Miller identifies the comparable matter–energy and information processing critical subsystems. Elaborating on the eight hierarchical levels, he defines society, which constitutes the seventh hierarchy, as "a large, living, concrete system with [community] and lower am levels of living systems as subsystems and components".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; Society may include small, primitive, totipotential communities; ancient city–states, and kingdoms; as well as modern nation–states and empires that are not supranational systems. Miller provides general descriptions of each of the subsystems that fit all eight levels.

A supranational system, in Miller's view, "is composed of two or more societies, some or all of whose processes are under the control of a decider that is superordinate to their highest echelons".&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1978, p. 903&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contends that no supranational system with all its twenty subsystems under control of its decider exists today. The absence of a supranational decider precludes the existence of a concrete supranational system. Miller says that studying a supranational system is problematical because its subsystems
&lt;blockquote&gt;...tend to consist of few components besides the decoder. These systems do little matter-energy processing. The power of component societies [nations] today is almost always greater than the power of supranational deciders. Traditionally, theory at this level has been based upon intuition and study of history rather than data collection. Some quantitative research is now being done, and construction of global-system models and simulations is currently burgeoning.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 1978, p. 1043.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the supranational system level, Miller's emphasis is on international organizations, associations, and groups comprising representatives of societies (nation–states). Miller identifies the subsystems at this level to suit this emphasis. Thus, for example, the reproducer is "any multipurpose supranational system which creates a single purpose supranational organization" (p.&amp;nbsp;914); and the boundary is the "supranational forces, usually located on or near supranational borders, which defend, guard, or police them" (p.&amp;nbsp;914).

===Strengths of Miller's theory===
Not just those specialized in international communication, but all communication science scholars could pay particular attention to the major contributions of living systems theory (LST) to social systems approaches that [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]], (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out:
* The specification of the twenty critical subsystems in any living system.
* The specification of the eight hierarchical levels of living systems.
* The emphasis on cross-level analysis and the production of numerous cross-level hypotheses.
* Cross-subsystem research (e.g., formulation and testing of hypotheses in two or more subsystems at a time).
* Cross-level, cross-subsystem research.

[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] says that LST, perhaps the "most integrative" social systems theory, has made many more contributions that may be easily overlooked, such as: providing a detailed analysis of types of systems; making a distinction between concrete and abstracted systems; discussion of physical space and time; placing emphasis on information processing; providing an analysis of entropy;  recognition of totipotential systems, and partipotential systems; providing an innovative approach to the structure–process issue; and introducing the concept of joint subsystem—a subsystem that belongs to two systems simultaneously; of dispersal—lateral, outward, upward, and downward; of inclusion—inclusion of something from the environment that is not part of the system; of artifact—an animal-made or human-made inclusion; of adjustment process, which combats stress in a system; and of critical subsystems, which carry out processes that all living systems need to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey 2006, pp.292–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

LST's analysis of the twenty interacting subsystems, [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Bailey]] adds, clearly distinguishing between matter–energy-processing and information-processing, as well as LST's analysis of the eight interrelated system levels, enables us to understand how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST also analyzes the irregularities or "organizational pathologies" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information–input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates [[negentropy]] with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth D. bailey, 1994, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
It omits the analysis of subjective phenomena, and it overemphasizes concrete Q-analysis (correlation of objects) to the virtual exclusion of R-analysis (correlation of variables). By asserting that societies (ranging from [[Totipotent#Totipotency|totipotential]] communities to nation-states and non-supranational systems) have greater control over their subsystem components than supranational systems have, it dodges the issue of transnational power over the contemporary social systems. Miller's supranational system bears no resemblance to the modern world-system that [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) described, although both of them were looking at the same living (dissipative) structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10442">The '''Marangoni effect''' (also called the '''Gibbs–Marangoni effect''') is the [[mass transfer]] along an [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between two fluids due to a [[gradient]] of the [[surface tension]]. In the case of temperature dependence, this phenomenon may be called '''thermo-capillary convection'''&lt;ref name="comsol1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comsol.com/showroom/gallery/110/ |title=Marangoni Convection |publisher=COMSOL |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Bénard–Marangoni convection''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Getling|first1=A.V.|title=Rayleigh-Bénard convection : structures and dynamics|date=1998|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location=Singapore|isbn=981-02-2657-8|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This phenomenon was first identified in the so-called "[[tears of wine]]" by physicist [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] ([[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]'s brother) in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;James Thomson (1855) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "On certain curious Motions observable at the Surfaces of Wine and other Alcoholic Liquors,"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', '''10''' : 330-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The general effect is named after [[Italy|Italian]] physicist [[Carlo Marangoni]], who studied it for his doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Pavia]] and published his results in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;C. Marangoni, ''Sull'espansione delle goccie d'un liquido galleggianti sulla superficie di altro liquido'' (On the expansion of a droplet of a liquid floating on the surface of another liquid) (Pavia, Italy:  fratelli Fusi (Fusi brothers), 1869).&lt;/ref&gt; A complete theoretical treatment of the subject was given by [[J. Willard Gibbs]] in his work ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'' (1875-8).&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Willard Gibbs (1878) "On the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances.  Part II," ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''3''' :  343-524.  The equation for the energy that's required to create a surface between two phases appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 483].  Reprinted in:  Josiah Willard Gibbs with Henry Andrews Bumstead and Ralph Gibbs van Name, ed.s, ''The Scientific Papers of J. Willard Gibbs, ...'', vol. 1, (New York, New York:  Longmans, Green and Co., 1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8RhWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 315].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Marangoni effect experimental demonstration.ogv|thumb|Marangoni effect experimental demonstration]]
[[File:Wine legs shadow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Tears of wine]] show clearly in the shadow of this glass of wine with a 13.5% alcohol content]]

Since a liquid with a high surface tension pulls more strongly on the surrounding liquid than one with a low surface tension, the presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).

As an example, [[wine]] may exhibit a visible effect called "tears", as shown in the photograph. The effect is a consequence of the fact that alcohol has a lower surface tension and higher volatility than water. The water/alcohol solution rises up the surface of the glass due to [[capillary action]]. Alcohol evaporates from the film leaving behind liquid with a higher surface tension (more water, less alcohol). This region with a lower concentration of alcohol (greater surface tension) pulls on the surrounding fluid more strongly than the regions with a higher alcohol concentration (lower in the glass). The result is the liquid is pulled up until its own weight exceeds the force of the effect, and the liquid drips back down the vessel's walls. This can also be easily demonstrated by spreading a thin film of water on a smooth surface and then allowing a drop of alcohol to fall on the center of the film. The liquid will rush out of the region where the drop of alcohol fell.

The [[Marangoni number]], a dimensionless value, can be used to characterize the relative effects of surface tension and viscous forces.

A very detailed mathematical treatment of this from the point of view of the [[Navier–Stokes equation]]s and the equations of [[thermodynamics]] can be found in the first third of [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's]] Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandrasekhar|first1=S.|title=Hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability|date=1981|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=978-0486640716|edition=[Dover ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1961 by Oxford, and republished by Dover in 1981.

==Significance to transport phenomena==
{{main|Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)}}

Under earth conditions, the effect of gravity causing [[natural convection]] in a system with a temperature gradient along a fluid/fluid interface is usually much stronger than the Marangoni effect. Many experiments ([[ESA]] MASER 1-3) have been conducted under [[Micro-g environment|microgravity conditions]] aboard [[sounding rockets]] to observe the Marangoni effect without the influence of gravity. Research on [[heat pipes]] performed on the [[International Space Station]] revealed that whilst heat pipes exposed to a temperature gradient on Earth cause the inner fluid to evaporate at one end and migrate along the pipe, thus drying the hot end, in space (where the effects of gravity can be ignored) the opposite happens and the hot end of the pipe is flooded with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Overview article: http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.146105?referer=rss Technical research paper: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.146105&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the Marangoni effect, together with [[capillary action]]. The fluid is drawn to the hot end of the tube by capillary action. But the bulk of the liquid still ends up as a droplet a short distance away from the hottest part of the tube, explained by Marangoni flow. The temperature gradients in axial and radial directions makes the fluid flow away from the hot end and the walls of the tube, towards the center axis. The liquid forms a droplet with a small contact area with the tube walls, a thin film circulating liquid between the cooler droplet and the liquid at the hot end.

The effect of the Marangoni effect on heat transfer in the presence of gas bubbles on the heating surface (e.g., in subcooled nucleate boiling) has long been ignored, but it is currently a topic of ongoing research interest because of its potential fundamental importance to the understanding of heat transfer in boiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrovic|first1=Sanja|last2=Robinson|first2=Tony|last3=Judd|first3=Ross L.|title=Marangoni heat transfer in subcooled nucleate pool boiling|journal=International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer|date=November 2004|volume=47|issue=23|pages=5115–5128|doi=10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2004.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and application==
A familiar example is in [[soap film]]s: the Marangoni effect ''stabilizes'' soap films. Another instance of the Marangoni effect appears in the behavior of convection cells, the so-called [[Bénard cells]].

One important application of the Marangoni effect is the use for drying [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]]s after a wet processing step during the manufacture of [[integrated circuits]]. Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an [[alcohol]] [[vapor]] (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a [[nozzle]] over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the cleaning liquid and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface.

A similar phenomenon has been creatively utilized to self-assemble nanoparticles into ordered arrays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cai|first1=Yangjun|last2=Zhang Newby|first2=Bi-min|title=Marangoni Flow-Induced Self-Assembly of Hexagonal and Stripelike Nanoparticle Patterns|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2008|volume=130|issue=19|pages=6076–6077|doi=10.1021/ja801438u|pmid=18426208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to grow ordered nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Wei Cheat|last2=Fang|first2=Yuanxing|last3=Kler|first3=Rantej|last4=Canciani|first4=Giacomo E.|last5=Draper|first5=Thomas C.|last6=Al-Abdullah|first6=Zainab T.Y.|last7=Alfadul|first7=Sulaiman M.|last8=Perry|first8=Christopher C.|last9=He|first9=Heyong|title=Marangoni ring-templated vertically aligned ZnO nanotube arrays with enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S025405841400697X|journal=Materials Chemistry and Physics|volume=149-150|pages=12–16|doi=10.1016/j.matchemphys.2014.10.046}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alcohol containing nanoparticles is spread on the substrate, followed by blowing the substrate with a humid air flow. The alcohol is evaporated under the flow. Simultaneously, water condenses and forms microdroplets on the substrate. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles in alcohol are transferred into the microdroplets and finally form numerous coffee rings on the substrate after drying.

The Marangoni effect is also important to the fields of [[welding]], [[crystal growth]] and [[electron beam]] melting of metals.&lt;ref name="comsol1"/&gt;

'''Metal clay''' is a [[crafting|crafting medium]] consisting of very small particles of metal such as [[silver]], [[gold]], bronze, or [[copper]] mixed with an [[organic binder]] and water for use in making [[jewelry]], [[bead]]s and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any [[Modelling clay|soft clay]], by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired in a variety of ways such as in a [[kiln]], with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it.  The binder burns away, leaving the pure [[sintering|sintered]] metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as [[bronze]], [[sterling silver]], and [[steel]] also are available.

==History==
Metal clay first came out in Japan in 1990&lt;ref name="Morikawa patent"&gt;{{US patent|5328775}} citing May 18, 1990 (19900518) [JP] Japan 2- 128447.&lt;/ref&gt; to allow craft jewelry makers to make sophisticated looking jewelry without the years of study needed to make fine jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Musante|first=Lynda S. |oclc=410210887 |author2=Maria Nerius |date=2000  |title=Jewelry making for fun &amp; profit: Make money doing what you love! |publisher=[[Random House|Random House Digital, Inc.]] |location= |isbn=0-7615-2044-9 |page=ii-iii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5dmsKNFOKYC&amp;pg=PT5 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silver metal clay==

Fine silver metal clay results in objects containing 99.9% pure silver, which is suitable for enameling. Lump metal clay is sold in sealed packets to keep it moist and workable. The silver versions are also available as a softer paste in a pre-filled syringe which can be used to produce extruded forms, in small jars of slip and as paper-like sheets, from which most of the moisture has been removed. Common brands of silver metal clay include Precious Metal Clay (PMC) and Art Clay Silver (ACS).

Metal clay artists looking for more strength in their silver creations can also mix PMC fine silver clay with an equal part of PMC Sterling clay.&lt;ref&gt;960: An alloy of sterling PMC |url=http://celiefagojewelry.blogspot.com/2014/02/960-new-alloy-of-sterling-pmc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The firing of this alloy is found to be up to {{convert|898|°C}} for two hours.

Another available alloy, EZ960 Sterling Silver Metal Clay was invented by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay™ and COPPRclay™. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at {{convert|913|°C}} for 2 hours, full ramp. No carbon required. Its shrinkage rate is smaller than other clays, at 10–11%.

===Precious Metal Clay (PMC)===
PMC was developed in the early 1990s in Japan by [[metallurgist]] Masaki Morikawa.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Precious Metal Clay by Mary Ann Devos (C)2003 published by Wardell Publications Inc {{ISBN|0-919985-36-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[solid phase|solid-phase]] [[sintered]] product of a [[Powder metallurgy|precious metal powder]] used to form a precious metal article,&lt;ref name="Morikawa patent"/&gt; the material consists of microscopic particles of pure silver or fine gold and a water-soluble, non-toxic, organic binder that burns off during firing. Success was first achieved with gold and later duplicated with silver. 
The PMC brand includes the following products:
* The original formula of PMC, now called "standard": fired at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for 2 hours, shrinks by 30% during firing.
* PMC+ &amp; PMCflex: fired at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for 10 minutes or {{convert|800|°C|°F}} for 30 minutes; shrinks 15%, due to a particle size reduction. PMC+ is also available in sheet form which can be worked like paper; for example, for [[origami]].
* PMC3: fired at {{convert|599|°C|°F}} for 45 minutes or {{convert|699|°C|°F}} for 10 minutes; shrinks by 10%. It can also be fired using a [[butane torch]] by heating it to [[Thermal radiation#Properties|orange heat]] for at least 2 minutes. It has a longer working life than the older formulations. It is also available in slip and paste forms which can be painted onto the surface of an object to be used as a mold.
* Aura 22: a 22-[[Carat (purity)|carat]] [[gilding]] material, a gold paste intended to be painted onto the surface of silver PMC pieces, or ready-made silver objects.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight, Tim. "What's New?" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, p42-45, 4p&lt;/ref&gt;
* PMC Pro: a harder product which is only 0.900 fineness silver, hence it cannot be [[Silver hallmarks|hallmarked]] as [[sterling silver]]. It also requires kiln firing in a tub of [[activated carbon]] for 1 hour at {{convert|760|°C|°F}}.
* PMC Sterling: is fired at {{convert|815|°C}} and shrinks by 10–20%. Because of the copper content in this formula, firing is a two-step process; step one is an open-shelf firing and step two requires a firing pan with activated carbon media.

===Art Clay Silver (ACS)===
ACS was developed by AIDA Chemical Industries, also a Japanese company. ACS followed PMC Standard with their Art Clay Original clay (more like PMC+ than PMC Standard), which allows the user to fire with a handheld torch or on a gas hob. Owing to subtle differences in the binder and suggested firing times, this clay shrinks less than the PMC versions, approximately 8–10%.

Further developments introduced the Art Clay Slow Dry, a clay with a longer working time. Art Clay 650 and Art Clay 650 Slow Dry soon followed; both clays can be fired at {{convert|650|°C|°F}}, allowing the user to combine the clay with glass and sterling silver, which are affected negatively by the higher temperatures needed to fire the first generation clays. AIDA also manufacturers Oil Paste, a product used only on fired metal clay or milled fine silver, and Overlay Paste, which is designed for drawing designs on glass and porcelain.

In 2006 AIDA introduced the Art Clay Gold Paste, a more economical way to work with gold. The paste is painted onto the fired silver clay, then refired in a kiln, or with a torch or gas stove. When fired, it bonds with the silver, giving a 22-carat gold accent. The same year also saw Art Clay Slow Tarnish introduced, a clay that tarnishes less rapidly than the other metal clays.

==Base metal clays==
Lump metal clay in bronze was introduced in 2008 by Metal Adventures Inc. and in 2009 by Prometheus. Lump metal clays in copper were introduced in 2009 by Metal Adventures Inc. and Aida. Because of the lower cost, the bronze and copper metal clays are used by artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; more often than the gold and silver metal clays in the American market place. The actual creation time of a bronze or copper piece is also far greater than that of its silver counterpart.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Base metal clays, such as bronze, copper, and steel metal clays are best fired in the absence of oxygen to eliminate the oxidation of the metal by atmospheric oxygen. A means to accomplish this –- to place the pieces in activated carbon inside a container – was developed by Bill Struve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powders==
Metal clays are also available as dry powders to which water is added to hydrate and kneaded to attain a clay consistency.  One advantage to the powders are their unlimited shelf life. The first silver clay in powder form was released in 2006 as Silver Smiths' Metal Clay Powder.&lt;ref&gt;MCPsilver999 | url=http://www.metalclaypowder.com |&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years base metal clays by Hadar Jacobson and Goldie World released several variation containing copper, brass, and even steel.

A '''mineral''' is a naturally occurring [[chemical compound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hans-Rudolf |last1=Wenk |first2=Andrei |last2=Bulakh |title=Minerals: Their Constitution and Origin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn= 9780521529587|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually of [[crystal]]line form and [[abiogenic|not produced by life processes]]. A  mineral has one specific [[chemical composition]], whereas a [[rock (geology)|rock]] can be an [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] of different minerals or [[mineraloid]]s. The study of minerals is called [[mineralogy]].

Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. As of November 2018, there are [[List of minerals (complete)|more than 5,500]] known mineral ''species'';&lt;ref name="rruff1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rruff.info/ima/ |title=IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ RRUFF Project |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Department of Geosciences, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,389 of these have been approved by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrmima.nrm.se//imalist.htm | title=The New IMA List of Minerals  – A Work in Progress | publisher=[[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] – CNMNC (Commission on New Minerals Nomenclature and Classification) | work=The New IMA List of Minerals | date=September 2018 | accessdate=2 November 2018 | author=Pasero, Marco et al.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minerals are distinguished by various [[Chemical property|chemical]] and [[physical property|physical properties]]. Differences in [[chemical composition]] and [[crystal structure]] distinguish the various species, which were determined by the mineral's geological environment when formed. Changes in the temperature, pressure, or bulk composition of a rock mass cause changes in its minerals. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral ''variety'',&lt;ref name="MinVar1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/mineral_variety | title=Definition of mineral variety | publisher=mindat.org | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[amethyst]], a purple variety of the mineral species [[quartz]].

Minerals can be described by their various physical properties, which are related to their chemical structure and composition. Common distinguishing characteristics include crystal structure and [[Crystal habit|habit]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[diaphaneity]], colour, [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]], [[Tenacity (mineralogy)|tenacity]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (mineralogy)|fracture]], parting, [[specific gravity]], [[magnetism]], taste or smell, [[radioactivity]], and [[acid|reaction to acid]].

Minerals are classified by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. [[Silicon]] and [[oxygen]] constitute approximately 75% of the Earth's crust, which translates directly into the predominance of [[silicate minerals]]. The silicate minerals compose over 90% of the [[Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/mineral-chemical-compound/Silicates&lt;/ref&gt; The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the degree of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymerization]] in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen [[anion]]s, which gives the shape of a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the [[Native element minerals|native elements]], [[Sulfide minerals|sulfides]], [[Oxide minerals|oxides]], [[Halide minerals|halides]], [[Carbonate minerals|carbonates]], [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]], and [[Phosphate minerals|phosphates]].

==Definition==

===Basic definition===
One definition of a mineral encompasses the following criteria:&lt;ref name="DG2_4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mineralogy and Optical Mineralogy|last = Dyar, Gunter, and Tasa|first = |publisher = Mineralogical Society of America|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0939950812|location = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Formed by a natural process ([[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] compounds are excluded).
#[[thermodynamic stability|Stable or metastable]] at [[room  temperature]] (25&amp;nbsp;°C). In the simplest sense, this means the mineral must be solid. Classical examples of exceptions to this rule include native [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which crystallizes at −39&amp;nbsp;°C, and water ice, which is solid only below 0&amp;nbsp;°C; because these two minerals were described before 1959, they were grandfathered by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2647.html |title=Mercury |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2001.html |title=Ice |publisher=Mindat.org |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern advances have included extensive study of [[liquid crystals]], which also extensively involve mineralogy.
#Represented by a [[chemical formula]]. Minerals are chemical compounds, and as such they can be described by fixed or a variable formula. Many mineral groups and species are composed of a solid solution; pure substances are not usually found because of contamination or chemical substitution. For example, the [[olivine]] group is described by the variable formula (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a solid solution of two end-member species, magnesium-rich [[forsterite]] and iron-rich [[fayalite]], which are described by a fixed chemical formula. Mineral species themselves could have a variable composition, such as the sulfide [[mackinawite]], (Fe, Ni)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, which is mostly a ferrous sulfide, but has a very significant nickel impurity that is reflected in its formula.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2512.html|title=Mackinawite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Ordered atomic arrangement. This generally means [[crystallinity|crystalline]]; however, crystals are also periodic, so the broader criterion is used instead.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; An ordered atomic arrangement gives rise to a variety of [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] physical properties, such as crystal form, hardness, and cleavage.&lt;ref name="CL13-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several recent proposals to classify biogenic or [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] substances as minerals. The formal definition of a mineral approved by the IMA in 1995: "A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes."&lt;ref name=Nickel&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nickel |first = Ernest H. |title = The definition of a mineral |journal = The Canadian Mineralogist |volume = 33 |issue = 3 |pages = 689–90 |date = 1995 |url = https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/canmin/article-abstract/33/3/689/12679/the-definition-of-a-mineral?redirectedFrom=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Usually [[abiogenic]] (not resulting from the activity of living organisms). Biogenic substances are explicitly excluded by the IMA: "Biogenic substances are chemical compounds produced entirely by biological processes without a geological component (e.g., urinary calculi, oxalate crystals in plant tissues, shells of marine molluscs, etc.) and are not regarded as minerals. However, if geological processes were involved in the genesis of the compound, then the product can be accepted as a mineral."&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;

The first three general characteristics are less debated than the last two.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt;

===Recent advances===
Mineral classification schemes and their definitions are evolving to match recent advances in mineral science. Recent changes have included the addition of an organic class, in both the new Dana and the [[Strunz classification]] schemes.&lt;ref name=Dana&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Classification 8th edition – Organic Compounds|url=http://www.mindat.org/dana.php?a=50|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strunz&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickel-Strunz Classification - silicates (Germanates) 10th edition|url=https://www.mindat.org/strunz.php?a=9|website=mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organic class includes a very rare group of minerals with [[hydrocarbons]]. The IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names adopted in 2009 a hierarchical scheme for the naming and classification of mineral groups and group names and established seven commissions and four working groups to review and classify minerals into an official listing of their published names.&lt;ref name="Mills09" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html IMA divisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810045840/http://www.ima-mineralogy.org/sciactivities.html |date=2011-08-10 }}. Ima-mineralogy.org (2011-01-12). Retrieved on 2011-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to these new rules, "mineral species can be grouped in a number of different ways, on the basis of chemistry, crystal structure, occurrence, association, genetic history, or resource, for example, depending on the purpose to be served by the classification."&lt;ref name="Mills09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mills | first1=J. S. | last2=Hatert | first2=F. | last3=Nickel | first3=E. H. | last4=Ferraris | first4=G. | title=The standardisation of mineral group hierarchies: application to recent nomenclature proposals | journal=European Journal of Mineralogy | volume=21 | pages=1073–80 | doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2009/0021-1994 | date=2009 | issue=5 | bibcode=2009EJMin..21.1073M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nickel (1995){{huh|date=September 2017}} exclusion of biogenic substances was not universally adhered to. For example, Lowenstam (1981) stated that "organisms are capable of forming a diverse array of minerals, some of which cannot be formed inorganically in the biosphere."&lt;ref name="Lowenstam81"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Lowenstam | last1=H. A. | title=Minerals formed by organisms | journal=Science | date=1981 | volume=211 | issue=4487 | pages=1126–31 | doi=10.1126/science.7008198 | jstor=1685216 | pmid=7008198|bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1126L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is a matter of classification and less to do with the constituents of the minerals themselves. Skinner (2005) views all solids as potential minerals and includes [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] in the mineral kingdom, which are those that are created by the metabolic activities of organisms. Skinner expanded the previous definition of a mineral to classify "element or compound, amorphous or crystalline, formed through ''[[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] '' processes," as a mineral.&lt;ref name="Skinner05" /&gt;

Recent advances in high-resolution [[genetics]] and [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]] are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between [[microorganism]]s and minerals that may make Nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and Skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity.&lt;ref name=Nickel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinner05"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Skinner | first1=H. C.

Prior to the International Mineralogical Association's listing, over 60 biominerals had been discovered, named, and published.&lt;ref name="Veis90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Veis | first1=A. | title=Biomineralization. Cell Biology and Mineral Deposition. by Kenneth Simkiss; Karl M. Wilbur On Biomineralization. by Heinz A.

To date, over 80,000 liquid crystalline compounds have been identified.&lt;ref name="Bouligand06"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bouligand | first=Y. | chapter=Liquid crystals and morphogenesis. | title=Morphogenesis: Origins of Patterns and Shape | editor1-last=Bourgine | editor1-first=P. | editor2-last=Lesne | editor2-first=A. | pages=49 ff | date=2006 | publisher=Springer Verlag | location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9783642131745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabriel03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gabriel | first1=C.

The Skinner (2005) definition of a mineral takes this matter into account by stating that a mineral can be crystalline or amorphous, the latter group including liquid crystals.&lt;ref name="Skinner05" /&gt; Although biominerals and liquid mineral crystals, are not the most common form of minerals,&lt;ref name=Hefferan10&gt;{{cite book | first1=Hefferan | last1=K. | first2=O'Brien | last2=J. | title=Earth Materials | date=2010 | isbn=978-1-4443-3460-9 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; they help to define the limits of what constitutes a mineral proper. The formal Nickel (1995) definition explicitly mentioned crystallinity as a key to defining a substance as a mineral. A 2011 article defined [[icosahedrite]], an aluminium-iron-copper alloy as mineral; named for its unique natural [[icosahedral symmetry]], it is a [[quasicrystal]].

===Rocks, ores, and gems===
[[File:Sillimanite-199671.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Schist]] is a [[metamorphic rock]] characterized by an abundance of platy minerals. In this example, the rock has prominent [[sillimanite]] [[porphyroblast]]s as large as {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.]]
Minerals are not equivalent to rocks. A [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is an aggregate of one or more minerals&lt;ref name="ChL15-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as [[limestone]] or [[quartzite]], are composed primarily of one mineral—[[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] in the case of limestone, and [[quartz]] in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 719–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a [[granite]] is defined by proportions of quartz, [[alkali feldspar]], and [[plagioclase feldspar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 694–96&lt;/ref&gt; The other minerals in the rock are termed accessory, and do not greatly affect the bulk composition of the rock. Rocks can also be composed entirely of non-mineral material; [[coal]] is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of organically derived carbon.&lt;ref name="ChL15-16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 728–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In rocks, some mineral species and groups are much more abundant than others; these are termed the rock-forming minerals. The major examples of these are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, the [[mica]]s, the [[amphibole]]s, the [[pyroxene]]s, the [[olivine]]s, and calcite; except for the last one, all of these minerals are silicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, around 150 minerals are considered particularly important, whether in terms of their abundance or aesthetic value in terms of collecting.&lt;ref name="ChL14"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially valuable minerals and rocks are referred to as [[industrial minerals]]. For example, [[muscovite]], a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, pp. 531–32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ore]]s are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), an ore of tin. [[gemstone|Gem]]s are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] are both [[corundum]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ChL14-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomenclature and classification===
Minerals are classified by variety, species, series and group, in order of increasing generality. The basic level of definition is that of mineral species, each of which is distinguished from the others by unique chemical and physical properties. For example, quartz is defined by its [[Chemical formula|formula]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a specific [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]] that distinguishes it from other minerals with the same chemical formula (termed [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). When there exists a range of composition between two minerals species, a mineral series is defined. For example, the [[biotite]] series is represented by variable amounts of the [[endmembers]] [[phlogopite]], [[siderophyllite]], [[annite]], and [[eastonite]]. In contrast, a mineral group is a grouping of mineral species with some common chemical properties that share a crystal structure. The [[pyroxene]] group has a common  formula of XY(Si,Al)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, where X and Y are both cations, with X typically [[ionic radius|bigger]] than Y; the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates that crystallize in either the [[orthorhombic]] or [[monoclinic]] crystal systems. Finally, a mineral variety is a specific type of mineral species that differs by some physical characteristic, such as colour or crystal habit. An example is [[amethyst]], which is a purple variety of quartz.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common classifications, Dana and Strunz, are used for minerals; both rely on composition, specifically with regards to important chemical groups, and structure. [[James Dwight Dana]], a leading geologist of his time, first published his ''System of Mineralogy'' in 1837; as of 1997, it is in its eighth edition. The Dana classification assigns a four-part number to a mineral species. Its class number is based on important compositional groups; the type gives the ratio of cations to anions in the mineral, and the last two numbers group minerals by structural similarity within a given type or class. The less commonly used [[Strunz classification]], named for German mineralogist [[Karl Hugo Strunz]], is based on the Dana system, but combines both chemical and structural criteria, the latter with regards to distribution of chemical bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp 558–59&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|11}}, 5,389 mineral species are approved by the IMA.&lt;ref name="IMAMineralsCount"/&gt; They are most commonly named after a person (45%), followed by discovery location (23%); names based on chemical composition (14%) and physical properties (8%) are the two other major groups of mineral name etymologies.&lt;ref name="DG20-22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "species" (from the Latin ''species'', "a particular sort, kind, or type with distinct look, or appearance")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/species|website=etymonline|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the classification scheme in ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. He divided the natural world into three kingdoms &amp;ndash; plants, animals, and minerals &amp;ndash; and classified each with the same hierarchy.&lt;ref name="wilk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilk|first1=H|editor1-last=Wilk|editor1-first=H|title=The Magic of Minerals|date=1986|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-64783-3|page=154|format=Hardcover|chapter=Systematic Classification of Minerals|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-61304-3_7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In descending order, these were Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Tribe, Genus, and Species.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Hubnerite-Quartz-216455.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Hübnerite]], the manganese-rich end-member of the [[wolframite]] series, with minor quartz in the background]]
The abundance and diversity of minerals is controlled directly by their chemistry, in turn dependent on elemental abundances in the Earth. The majority of minerals observed are derived from the Earth's crust. Eight elements account for most of the key components of minerals, due to their abundance in the crust. These eight elements, summing to over 98% of the crust by weight, are, in order of decreasing abundance: [[oxygen]], [[silicon]], [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[potassium]]. Oxygen and silicon are by far the two most important – oxygen composes 47% of the crust by weight, and silicon accounts for 28%.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The minerals that form are directly controlled by the bulk chemistry of the parent body. For example, a [[magma]] rich in iron and magnesium will form [[mafic]] minerals, such as olivine and the pyroxenes; in contrast, a more silica-rich magma will crystallize to form minerals that incorporate more SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as the feldspars and quartz. In a [[limestone]], [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]] (both CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) form because the rock is rich in calcium and carbonate.  A corollary is that a mineral will not be found in a rock whose bulk chemistry does not resemble the bulk chemistry of a given mineral with the exception of trace minerals. For example, [[kyanite]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; forms from the [[metamorphism]] of aluminium-rich [[shale]]s; it would not likely occur in aluminium-poor rock, such as [[quartzite]].

The chemical composition may vary between [[Endmember (mineralogy)|end member]] species of a [[solid solution]] series. For example, the [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]s comprise a continuous series from [[sodium]]-rich end member [[albite]] (NaAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[calcium]]-rich [[anorthite]] (CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): [[oligoclase]], [[andesine]], [[labradorite]], and [[bytownite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the [[wolframite]] series of [[manganese]]-rich [[hübnerite]] and iron-rich [[ferberite]].

Chemical substitution and coordination polyhedra explain this common feature of minerals. In nature, minerals are not pure substances, and are contaminated by whatever other elements are present in the given chemical system. As a result, it is possible for one element to be substituted for another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical substitution will occur between ions of a similar size and charge; for example, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will not substitute for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; because of chemical and structural incompatibilities caused by a big difference in size and charge. A common example of chemical substitution is that of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which are close in charge, size, and abundance in the crust. In the example of plagioclase, there are three cases of substitution. Feldspars are all framework silicates, which have a silicon-oxygen ratio of 2:1, and the space for other elements is given by the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to give a base unit of [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;; without the substitution, the formula would be charge-balanced as SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, giving quartz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this structural property will be explained further by coordination polyhedra. The second substitution occurs between Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; however, the difference in charge has to accounted for by making a second substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination polyhedra are geometric representations of how a cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; surrounded by four O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: in the case of the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where the compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination with oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination numbers because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last [[Atomic orbital|orbital subshell]] of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure, such as in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and [[garnet]], will change to a [[perovskite structure]], where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Other examples are the aluminosilicates [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] (polymorphs, since they share the formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which differ by the coordination number of the Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature.&lt;ref name="DG4-7"/&gt; In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 12–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaolinite-Orthoclase-lw18c.jpg|thumb|When minerals react, the products will sometimes assume the shape of the reagent; the product mineral is termed a pseudomorph of (or after) the reagent. Illustrated here is a pseudomorph of [[kaolinite]] after [[orthoclase]]. Here, the pseudomorph preserved the Carlsbad [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] common in orthoclase.]]

Changes in temperature and pressure and composition alter the mineralogy of a rock sample. Changes in composition can be caused by processes such as [[weathering]] or [[metasomatism]] ([[hydrothermal alteration]]). Changes in temperature and pressure occur when the host rock undergoes [[tectonic]] or [[magmatic]] movement into differing physical regimes. Changes in [[thermodynamic]] conditions make it favourable for mineral assemblages to react with each other to produce new minerals; as such, it is possible for two rocks to have an identical or a very similar bulk rock chemistry without having a similar mineralogy. This process of mineralogical alteration is related to the [[rock cycle]]. An example of a series of mineral reactions is illustrated as follows.&lt;ref name="DG549"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthoclase]] feldspar (KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is a mineral commonly found in [[granite]], a [[plutonic]] [[igneous rock]]. When exposed to weathering, it reacts to form [[kaolinite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a sedimentary mineral, and [[silicic acid]]):

:2 KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Under low-grade metamorphic conditions, kaolinite reacts with quartz to form [[pyrophyllite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

As metamorphic grade increases, the pyrophyllite reacts to form kyanite and quartz:

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Alternatively, a mineral may change its crystal structure as a consequence of changes in temperature and pressure without reacting. For example, quartz will change into a variety of its SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]], such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, and [[coesite]] at high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Classifying minerals ranges from simple to difficult. A mineral can be identified by several physical properties, some of them being sufficient for full identification without equivocation. In other cases, minerals can only be classified by more complex [[Optical mineralogy|optical]], chemical or [[X-ray diffraction]] analysis; these methods, however, can be costly and time-consuming.  Physical properties applied for classification include crystal structure and habit, hardness, lustre, diaphaneity, colour, streak, cleavage and fracture, and specific gravity. Other less general tests include [[fluorescence]], [[phosphorescence]], [[magnetism]], [[radioactivity]], tenacity (response to mechanical induced changes of shape or form), [[piezoelectricity]] and reactivity to dilute [[acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Topaz-235220.jpg|right|thumb|[[Topaz]] has a characteristic orthorhombic elongated crystal shape.]]
[[Crystal structure]] results from the orderly geometric spatial arrangement of atoms in the internal structure of a mineral. This crystal structure is based on regular internal atomic or [[ion]]ic arrangement that is often expressed in the geometric form that the crystal takes. Even when the mineral grains are too small to see or are irregularly shaped, the underlying crystal structure is always periodic and can be determined by [[X-ray]] diffraction.&lt;ref name="DG2_4" /&gt; Minerals are typically described by their symmetry content. Crystals are [[crystallographic restriction theorem|restricted]] to [[Crystallographic point group|32 point groups]], which differ by their symmetry. These groups are classified in turn into more broad categories, the most encompassing of these being the six crystal families.&lt;ref name="DG69-80"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 69–80&lt;/ref&gt;

These families can be described by the relative lengths of the three crystallographic axes, and the angles between them; these relationships correspond to the symmetry operations that define the narrower point groups. They are summarized below; a, b, and c represent the axes, and α, β, γ represent the angle opposite the respective crystallographic axis (e.g. α is the angle opposite the a-axis, [[wikt:viz.|viz.]] the angle between the b and c axes):&lt;ref name="DG69-80" /&gt;

The hexagonal crystal family is also split into two crystal ''systems'' – the [[trigonal]], which has a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, which has a six-fold axis of symmetry.

Chemistry and crystal structure together define a mineral. With a restriction to 32 point groups, minerals of different chemistry may have identical crystal structure. For example, [[halite]] (NaCl), [[galena]] (PbS), and [[periclase]] (MgO) all belong to the hexaoctahedral point group (isometric family), as they have a similar [[stoichiometry]] between their different constituent elements. In contrast, [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] are groupings of minerals that share a chemical formula but have a different structure. For example, [[pyrite]] and [[marcasite]], both iron sulfides, have the formula FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; however, the former is isometric while the latter is orthorhombic. This polymorphism extends to other sulfides with the generic AX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formula; these two groups are collectively known as the pyrite and marcasite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 654–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymorphism can extend beyond pure symmetry content. The aluminosilicates are a group of three minerals – [[kyanite]], [[andalusite]], and [[sillimanite]] – which share the chemical formula Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These differences arise corresponding to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination with oxygen. Silicon, as a general rule, is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a case like [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 581&lt;/ref&gt; In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (Al&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 631–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in crystal structure and chemistry greatly influence other physical properties of the mineral. The carbon allotropes [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] have vastly different properties; diamond is the hardest natural substance, has an adamantine lustre, and belongs to the isometric crystal family, whereas graphite is very soft, has a greasy lustre, and crystallises in the hexagonal family. This difference is accounted for by differences in bonding. In diamond, the carbons are in sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, which means they form a framework where each carbon is covalently bonded to four neighbours in a tetrahedral fashion; on the other hand, graphite is composed of sheets of carbons in sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybrid orbitals, where each carbon is bonded covalently to only three others. These sheets are held together by much weaker [[van der Waals force]]s, and this discrepancy translates to large macroscopic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinel-4mb4c.jpg|Contact twins, as seen in [[spinel]]|left|thumb]]

[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is the intergrowth of two or more crystals of a single mineral species. The geometry of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated twins have a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped [[staurolite]] twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. This type of twinning occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twins through the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, polysynthetic twinning occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.&lt;ref name="DG4143"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal habit refers to the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to describe this property. Common habits include acicular, which describes needlelike crystals as in [[natrolite]], bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in [[native copper]]), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardness===
{{main article|Mohs scale of mineral hardness}}
[[File:Rough diamond.jpg|right|thumb|Diamond is the hardest natural material, and has a Mohs hardness of 10.]]
The hardness of a mineral defines how much it can resist scratching. This physical property is controlled by the chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral. A mineral's hardness is not necessarily constant for all sides, which is a function of its structure; crystallographic weakness renders some directions softer than others.&lt;ref name="DG2829"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this property exists in kyanite, which has a Mohs hardness of 5½ parallel to [001] but 7 parallel to [100].&lt;ref name="Kyanite"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-2303.html|title=Kyanite|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=[[Mindat.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common scale of measurement is the ordinal Mohs hardness scale. Defined by ten indicators, a mineral with a higher index scratches those below it. The scale ranges from talc, a [[phyllosilicate]], to diamond, a carbon polymorph that is the hardest natural material. The scale is provided below:&lt;ref name="DG2829"/&gt;

===Lustre and diaphaneity===
{{main article|Lustre (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Pyrite 2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pyrite]] has a metallic lustre.]]
Lustre indicates how light reflects from the mineral's surface, with regards to its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and non-metallic categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are [[galena]] and pyrite. Non-metallic lustres include: adamantine, such as in [[diamond]]; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in [[talc]] and [[apophyllite]]; resinous, such as members of the garnet group; silky which is common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform [[chrysotile]].&lt;ref name="DG2628"&gt;Dyar and Darby, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[diaphaneity]] of a mineral describes the ability of light to pass through it. Transparent minerals do not diminish the intensity of light passing through them. An example of a transparent mineral is [[muscovite]] (potassium mica); some varieties are sufficiently clear to have been used for windows. Translucent minerals allow some light to pass, but less than those that are transparent. [[Jadeite]] and [[nephrite]] (mineral forms of [[jade]] are examples of minerals with this property). Minerals that do not allow light to pass are called opaque.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DG25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The diaphaneity of a mineral depends on the thickness of the sample. When a mineral is sufficiently thin (e.g., in a [[thin section]] for [[petrography]]), it may become transparent even if that property is not seen in a hand sample. In contrast, some minerals, such as [[hematite]] or pyrite, are opaque even in thin-section.&lt;ref name="DG25" /&gt;

===Colour and streak===

&lt;!--[[File:Tourmaline.xtal.750pix.jpg|Watermelon [[elbaite]]|left|thumb]]--&gt;
Colour is the most obvious property of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by [[electromagnetic radiation]] interacting with electrons (except in the case of [[incandescence]], which does not apply to minerals).&lt;ref name="DG131144"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 131–44&lt;/ref&gt; Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic.&lt;ref name="B72"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG24"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such minerals are [[malachite]] (green) and [[azurite]] (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] varieties of the mineral [[corundum]].&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;
The colours of pseudochromatic minerals are the result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. Examples include [[labradorite]] and [[bornite]].

In addition to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, [[Asterism (gemmology)|asterism]], [[chatoyancy]], [[iridescence]], tarnish, and [[pleochroism]]. Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, such as in [[opal]], results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating on the surface of crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry.&lt;ref name="DG2426"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure.&lt;ref name="B73"&gt;{{harvnb|Busbey et al.|2007}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality corundum.&lt;ref name="DG2426" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B73"/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Streak plate with Pyrite and Rhodochrosite.jpg|thumb|Streak plates with [[pyrite]] (left) and [[rhodochrosite]] (right)|left]]--&gt;
The streak of a mineral refers to the colour of a mineral in powdered form, which may or may not be identical to its body colour.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; The most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate, which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black. The streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; or any weathering surface.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; A common example of this property is illustrated with [[hematite]], which is coloured black, silver, or red in hand sample, but has a cherry-red&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; to reddish-brown streak.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt; Streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to non-metallic minerals whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements.&lt;ref name="B72" /&gt; Streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the ''streak plate'' instead.&lt;ref name="DG24" /&gt;

===Cleavage, parting, fracture, and tenacity===
{{main article|Cleavage (crystal)|Fracture (mineralogy)}}
[[File:Biotite-Orthoclase-229808.jpg|left|thumb|Perfect basal cleavage as seen in [[biotite]] (black), and good cleavage seen in the matrix (pink [[orthoclase]]).]]
By definition, minerals have a characteristic atomic arrangement. Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage can be described based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are "perfect", "good", "distinct", and "poor". In particularly transparent minerals, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen as a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed from the side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, does not have a crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect basal cleavage, consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

As cleavage is a function of crystallography, there are a variety of cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal cleavage in one direction is a distinctive property of the [[mica]]s. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or [[rhodochrosite]], it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in [[fluorite]] and diamond, and [[sphalerite]] has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Minerals with many cleavages might not break equally well in all of the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three directions, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.&lt;ref name="DG39-40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChL30-31"/&gt;

Parting, sometimes called "false cleavage", is similar in appearance to cleavage but is instead produced by structural defects in the mineral, as opposed to systematic weakness. Parting varies from crystal to crystal of a mineral, whereas all crystals of a given mineral will cleave if the atomic structure allows for that property. In general, parting is caused by some stress applied to a crystal. The sources of the stresses include deformation (e.g. an increase in pressure), exsolution, or twinning. Minerals that often display parting include the pyroxenes, hematite, magnetite, and corundum.&lt;ref name="DG39-40"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

When a mineral is broken in a direction that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in [[native copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenacity is related to both cleavage and fracture. Whereas fracture and cleavage describes the surfaces that are created when a mineral is broken, tenacity describes how resistant a mineral is to such breaking. Minerals can be described as brittle, ductile, malleable, sectile, flexible, or elastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific gravity===
[[File:Calcite-Galena-elm56c.jpg|right|thumb|Galena, PbS, is a mineral with a high specific gravity.]]
[[Specific gravity]] numerically describes the [[density]] of a mineral. The dimensions of density are mass divided by volume with units: kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Specific gravity measures how much water a mineral sample displaces. Defined as the quotient of the mass of the sample and difference between the weight of the sample in air and its corresponding weight in water, specific gravity is a unitless ratio. Among most minerals, this property is not diagnostic. Rock forming minerals – typically silicates or occasionally carbonates – have a specific gravity of 2.5–3.5.&lt;ref name="DG4344"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

High specific gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates to a change in specific gravity. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a specific gravity of 5.26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1856.html|title=Hematite|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[galena]], PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1641.html|title=Galena|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a result of their high iron and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in [[native metal]]s; [[kamacite]], an iron-nickel alloy common in [[iron meteorite]]s has a specific gravity of 7.9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Kamacite.shtml#.WsQTQGbn9SM|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Webmineral.com|title=Kamacite|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.&lt;ref name="DG4344" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-1720.html|title=Gold|publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other properties===
[[File:Carnotite-201050.jpg|left|thumb|Carnotite (yellow) is a radioactive uranium-bearing mineral.]]
Other properties can be used to diagnose minerals. These are less general, and apply to specific minerals.

Dropping dilute acid (often 10% [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]]) onto a mineral aids in distinguishing carbonates from other mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate ([CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) group, which causes the affected area to [[effervesce]], giving off [[carbon dioxide]] gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered form. An example of this test is done when distinguishing calcite from [[dolomite]], especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a scratched surface in a rock), for it to effervesce.&lt;ref name="DG4445"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeolite]] minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|title=Mineral Identification Key: Radioactivity, Magnetism, Acid Reactions|publisher=[[Mineralogical Society of America]]|accessdate=2012-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922231836/http://minsocam.org/MSA/collectors_corner/id/mineral_id_keyi11.htm|archivedate=2012-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tested, [[magnetism]] is a very conspicuous property of minerals. Among common minerals, [[magnetite]] exhibits this property strongly, and magnetism is also present, albeit not as strongly, in [[pyrrhotite]] and [[ilmenite]].&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt; Some minerals exhibit electrical properties – for example, quartz is piezoelectric – but electrical properties are rarely used as diagnostic criteria for minerals because of incomplete data and natural variation.&lt;ref name="Helman2016"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Symmetry-based electricity in minerals and rocks: A summary of extant data, with examples of centrosymmetric minerals that exhibit pyro- and piezoelectricity | author=Helman, Daniel S. | journal=Periodico di Mineralogia | year=2016 | volume=85 | doi=10.2451/2016PM590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minerals can also be tested for taste or smell. Halite, NaCl, is table salt; its potassium-bearing counterpart, [[sylvite]], has a pronounced bitter taste. Sulfides have a characteristic smell, especially as samples are fractured, reacting, or powdered.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

[[Radioactivity]] is a rare property; minerals may be composed of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in [[uraninite]], [[autunite]], and [[carnotite]], or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a ''radioactive halo'' or ''[[pleochroic halo]]'', is observable with various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.&lt;ref name="DG4445" /&gt;

==Classification==
As the composition of the Earth's crust is dominated by silicon and oxygen, silicate elements are by far the most important class of minerals in terms of rock formation and diversity. However, non-silicate minerals are of great economic importance, especially as ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-silicate minerals are subdivided into several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which includes native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, [[pyrite]], [[magnetite]], and [[hematite]]. There are two major structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. [[Close-packing of equal spheres|close-packed structures]] is a way to densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space. Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (sulfate), PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (phosphate), AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (arsenate), and VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (vanadate). The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 641–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest grouping of minerals by far are the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]]; most rocks are composed of greater than 95% silicate minerals, and over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of these minerals.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The two main constituents of silicates are silicon and oxygen, which are the two most abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Other common elements in silicate minerals correspond to other common elements in the Earth's crust, such as aluminium, magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Some important rock-forming silicates include the [[feldspar]]s, quartz, [[olivine]]s, [[pyroxene]]s, [[amphibole]]s, [[garnet]]s, and [[mica]]s.

===Silicates===
{{main article|Silicate minerals}}
[[File:Aegirine-233494.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aegirine]], an iron-sodium clinopyroxene, is part of the inosilicate subclass.]]
The base unit of a silicate mineral is the [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron. In the vast majority of cases, silicon is in four-fold or tetrahedral coordination with oxygen. In very high-pressure situations, silicon will be in six-fold or octahedral coordination, such as in the [[perovskite structure]] or the quartz polymorph [[stishovite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In the latter case, the mineral no longer has a silicate structure, but that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and its associated group, which are simple oxides. These silica tetrahedra are then polymerized to some degree to create various structures, such as one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The basic silicate mineral where no polymerization of the tetrahedra has occurred requires other elements to balance out the base 4- charge. In other silicate structures, different combinations of elements are required to balance out the resultant negative charge. It is common for the Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to be substituted by  Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; because of similarity in ionic radius and charge; in those cases, the [AlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra form the same structures as do the unsubstituted tetrahedra, but their charge-balancing requirements are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of polymerization can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates have two or three shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 104–17&lt;/ref&gt;

The silicate subclasses are described below in order of decreasing polymerization.

====Tectosilicates====
[[File:Natroliteinde1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Natrolite]] is a mineral series in the zeolite group; this sample has a very prominent acicular crystal habit.]]
Tectosilicates, also known as framework silicates, have the highest degree of polymerization. With all corners of a tetrahedra shared, the silicon:oxygen ratio becomes 1:2. Examples are quartz, the [[feldspar]]s, [[feldspathoid]]s, and the [[zeolite]]s. Framework silicates tend to be particularly chemically stable as a result of strong covalent bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Chesterman and Cole, p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

Forming 12% of the Earth's crust, [[quartz]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the most abundant mineral species. It is characterized by its high chemical and physical resistivity. Quartz has several polymorphs, including [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] at high temperatures, high-pressure [[coesite]], and ultra-high pressure [[stishovite]]. The latter mineral can only be formed on Earth by meteorite impacts, and its structure has been composed so much that it had changed from a silicate structure to that of [[rutile]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The silica polymorph that is most stable at the Earth's surface is α-quartz. Its counterpart, β-quartz, is present only at high temperatures and pressures (changes to α-quartz below 573&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 bar). These two polymorphs differ by a "kinking" of bonds; this change in structure gives β-quartz greater symmetry than α-quartz, and they are thus also called high quartz (β) and low quartz (α).&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 104"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 578–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspars are the most abundant group in the Earth's crust, at about 50%. In the feldspars, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; substitutes for Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, which creates a charge imbalance that must be accounted for by the addition of cations. The base structure becomes either [AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  There are 22 mineral species of feldspars, subdivided into two major subgroups – alkali and plagioclase – and two less common groups – [[celsian]] and [[banalsite]]. The alkali feldspars are most commonly in a series between potassium-rich orthoclase and sodium-rich [[albite]]; in the case of plagioclase, the most common series ranges from albite to calcium-rich [[anorthite]]. Crystal twinning is common in feldspars, especially polysynthetic twins in plagioclase and Carlsbad twins in alkali feldspars. If the latter subgroup cools slowly from a melt, it forms exsolution lamellae because the two components – orthoclase and albite – are unstable in solid solution. Exsolution can be on a scale from microscopic to readily observable in hand-sample; perthitic texture forms when Na-rich feldspar exsolve in a K-rich host. The opposite texture (antiperthitic), where K-rich feldspar exsolves in a Na-rich host, is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 583–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldspathoids are structurally similar to feldspar, but differ in that they form in Si-deficient conditions, which allows for further substitution by Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, feldspathoids cannot be associated with quartz. A common example of a feldspathoid is [[nepheline]] ((Na, K)AlSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); compared to alkali feldspar, nepheline has an Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 1:2, as opposed to 1:6 in the feldspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; Zeolites often have distinctive crystal habits, occurring in needles, plates, or blocky masses. They form in the presence of water at low temperatures and pressures, and have channels and voids in their structure. Zeolites have several industrial applications, especially in waste water treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 589–93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phyllosilicates====
[[File:Muscovite-Albite-122886.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Muscovite, a mineral species in the mica group, within the phyllosilicate subclass]]
Phyllosilicates consist of sheets of polymerized tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important examples include the [[mica]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and the [[kaolinite]]-[[Serpentine group|serpentine]] groups. The sheets are weakly bound by [[van der Waals forces]] or [[hydrogen bond]]s, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent basal cleavage among the phyllosilicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balance out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked in a variety of combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The kaolinite-serpentine group consists of T-O stacks (the 1:1 clay minerals); their hardness ranges from 2 to 4, as the sheets are held by hydrogen bonds. The 2:1 clay minerals (pyrophyllite-talc) consist of T-O-T stacks, but they are softer (hardness from 1 to 2), as they are instead held together by van der Waals forces. These two groups of minerals are subgrouped by octahedral occupation; specifically, kaolinite and pyrophyllite are dioctahedral whereas serpentine and talc trioctahedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Micas are also T-O-T-stacked phyllosilicates, but differ from the other T-O-T and T-O-stacked subclass members in that they incorporate aluminium into the tetrahedral sheets (clay minerals have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral sites). Common examples of micas are [[muscovite]], and the [[biotite]] series. The chlorite group is related to mica group, but a [[brucite]]-like (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layer between the T-O-T stacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 602–05&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their chemical structure, phyllosilicates typically have flexible, elastic, transparent layers that are electrical insulators and can be split into very thin flakes. Micas can be used in electronics as insulators, in construction, as optical filler, or even cosmetics. Chrysotile, a species of serpentine, is the most common mineral species in industrial asbestos, as it is less dangerous in terms of health than the amphibole asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 593–95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inosilicates====
[[File:Asbestos with muscovite.jpg|left|thumb|[[Asbestiform]] [[tremolite]], part of the amphibole group in the inosilicate subclass]]
Inosilicates consist of tetrahedra repeatedly bonded in chains. These chains can be single, where a tetrahedron is bound to two others to form a continuous chain; alternatively, two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates. Single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;), whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g. [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;. Inosilicates contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly [[pyroxene]]s, while double-chain silicates are often [[amphibole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-order chains exist (e.g. three-member, four-member, five-member chains, etc.) but they are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/strunz/strunz.php?class=09&amp;subclass=09.D|title=09.D Inosilicates|publisher=Webmineral.com|accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyroxene group consists of 21 mineral species.&lt;ref name="DG112" /&gt; Pyroxenes have a general structure formula of XY(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), where X is an octahedral site, while Y can vary in coordination number from six to eight. Most varieties of pyroxene consist of permutations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to balance the negative charge on the backbone. Pyroxenes are common in the Earth's crust (about 10%) and are a key constituent of mafic igneous rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}} pp. 612–13&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphiboles have great variability in chemistry, described variously as a "mineralogical garbage can" or a "mineralogical shark swimming a sea of elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group ([OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), although it can be replaced by a fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 606–12&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="DG112"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Several amphibole mineral species can have an [[asbestiform]] crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as [[asbestosis]]; amphibole asbestos ([[anthophyllite]], [[tremolite]], [[actinolite]], [[grunerite]], and [[riebeckite]]) are considered more dangerous than [[chrysotile]] serpentine asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 611–12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyclosilicates====
[[File:Elbaite-121353.jpg|right|thumb|An example of elbaite, a species of tourmaline, with distinctive colour banding.]]
Cyclosilicates, or ring silicates, have a ratio of silicon to oxygen of 1:3. Six-member rings are most common, with a base structure of [Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;12−&lt;/sup&gt;; examples include the [[tourmaline]] group and [[beryl]]. Other ring structures exist, with 3, 4, 8, 9, 12 having been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 113–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyclosilicates tend to be strong, with elongated, striated crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourmalines have a very complex chemistry that can be described by a general formula XY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Z&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;W. The T&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; is the basic ring structure, where T is usually Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, but substitutable by Al&lt;sub&gt;3+&lt;/sub&gt; or B&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish). [[Cordierite]] is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 617–21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sorosilicates====
[[File:Epidote Oisans.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Epidote often has a distinctive pistachio-green colour.]]
Sorosilicates, also termed disilicates, have tetrahedron-tetrahedron bonding at one oxygen, which results in a 2:7 ratio of silicon to oxygen. The resultant common structural element is the [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; group. The most common disilicates by far are members of the [[epidote]] group. Epidotes are found in variety of geologic settings, ranging from mid-ocean ridge to granites to [[pelite|metapelites]]. Epidotes are built around the structure [(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;10−&lt;/sup&gt; structure; for example, the mineral ''species'' epidote has calcium, aluminium, and ferric iron to charge balance: Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al)(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)O(OH). The presence of iron as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; helps understand oxygen [[fugacity]], which in turn is a significant factor in petrogenesis.&lt;ref name="DG612-627"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 612–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of sorosilicates include [[lawsonite]], a  metamorphic mineral forming in the [[blueschist]] facies (subduction zone setting with low temperature and high pressure), [[vesuvianite]], which takes up a significant amount of calcium in its chemical structure.&lt;ref name="DG612-627" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 565–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthosilicates====
[[File:Andradite-172390.jpg|right|thumb|Black andradite, an end-member of the orthosilicate garnet group.]]
Orthosilicates consist of isolated tetrahedra that are charge-balanced by other cations.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; Also termed nesosilicates, this type of silicate has a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:4 (e.g. SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Typical orthosilicates tend to form blocky equant crystals, and are fairly hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; Several rock-forming minerals are part of this subclass, such as the aluminosilicates, the olivine group, and the garnet group.

The aluminosilicates –bkyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite, all Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; – are structurally composed of one [SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedron, and one Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in octahedral coordination. The remaining Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; can be in six-fold coordination (kyanite), five-fold (andalusite) or four-fold (sillimanite); which mineral forms in a given environment is depend on pressure and temperature conditions. In the olivine structure, the main olivine series of (Mg, Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; consist of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite. Both iron and magnesium are in octahedral by oxygen. Other mineral species having this structure exist, such as [[tephroite]], Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 574–75&lt;/ref&gt; The garnet group has a general formula of X&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where X is a large eight-fold coordinated cation, and Y is a smaller six-fold coordinated cation. There are six ideal endmembers of garnet, split into two group. The pyralspite garnets have Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Y position: [[pyrope]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[almandine]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[spessartine]] (Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The ugrandite garnets have Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the X position: [[uvarovite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[grossular]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[andradite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). While there are two subgroups of garnet, solid solutions exist between all six end-members.&lt;ref name="DG116-117"/&gt;

Other orthosilicates include [[zircon]], [[staurolite]], and [[topaz]]. Zircon (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is useful in geochronology as the Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; can be substituted by U&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;; furthermore, because of its very resistant structure, it is difficult to reset it as a chronometer. Staurolite is a common metamorphic intermediate-grade index mineral. It has a particularly complicated crystal structure that was only fully described in 1986. Topaz (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(F, OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, often found in granitic pegmatites associated with [[tourmaline]], is a common gemstone mineral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 627–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-silicates===

====Native elements====
{{main article|Native element minerals}}
[[File:Gold-mz4b.jpg|left|thumb|Native gold. Rare specimen of stout crystals growing off of a central stalk, size 3.7 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm, from Venezuela.]]
[[native element minerals|Native elements]] are those that are not chemically bonded to other elements. This mineral group includes [[native metal]]s, semi-metals, and non-metals, and various alloys and solid solutions. The metals are held together by metallic bonding, which confers distinctive physical properties such as their shiny metallic lustre, ductility and malleability, and electrical conductivity. Native elements are subdivided into groups by their structure or chemical attributes.

The gold group, with a cubic close-packed structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum group is similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are [[kamacite]] and [[taenite]], which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ by the amount of Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of [[telluric iron|native iron]], whereas the nickel content of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic traits; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 644–48&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfides====
{{main article|Sulfide minerals}}
[[File:Cinnabar on Dolomite.jpg|right|thumb|Red cinnabar (HgS), a mercury ore, on dolomite.]]
The [[sulfide minerals]] are chemical compounds of one or more metals or semimetals with a sulfur; tellurium, arsenic, or selenium can substitute for the sulfur. Sulfides tend to be soft, brittle minerals with a high specific gravity. Many powdered sulfides, such as pyrite, have a sulfurous smell when powdered. Sulfides are susceptible to weathering, and many readily dissolve in water; these dissolved minerals can be later redeposited, which creates enriched secondary ore deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfides are classified by the ratio of the metal or semimetal to the sulfur, such as M:S equal to 2:1, or 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 649&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[sulfide mineral]]s are economically important as metal [[ore]]s; examples include [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), an ore of zinc, [[galena]] (PbS), an ore of lead, [[cinnabar]] (HgS), an ore of mercury, and [[molybdenite]] (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an ore of molybdenum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 651–54&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is the most commonly occurring sulfide, and can be found in most geological environments. It is not, however, an ore of iron, but can be instead oxidized to produce sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 654&lt;/ref&gt; Related to the sulfides are the rare [[Sulfosalt mineral|sulfosalts]], in which a metallic element is bonded to sulfur and a semimetal such as [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], or [[bismuth]]. Like the sulfides, sulfosalts are typically soft, heavy, and brittle minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oxides====
{{main article|Oxide minerals}}
[[Oxide minerals]] are divided into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The [[periclase]] group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include [[cuprite]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as [[corundum]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[hematite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the chief ore of [[titanium]]; other examples include [[cassiterite]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[tin]]), and [[pyrolusite]] (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; ore of [[manganese]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 400–03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 657–60&lt;/ref&gt;  In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Bauxite]]s are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals [[diaspore]], [[gibbsite]], and [[bohmite]]; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 663–64&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the [[spinel group|spinels]], with a general formula of X&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Examples of species include [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chromite]] (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two [[oxidation state]]s (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which makes it a multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 660–63&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halides====
{{main article|Halide minerals}}
[[File:Halite-Nahcolite-51411.jpg|left|thumb|Pink cubic [[halite]] (NaCl; halide class) crystals on a [[nahcolite]] matrix (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; a carbonate, and mineral form of sodium bicarbonate, used as [[baking soda]]).]]

The [[halide minerals]] are compounds in which a [[halogen]] (fluorine, chlorine, iodine, or bromine) is the main anion. These minerals tend to be soft, weak, brittle, and water-soluble. Common examples of halides include halite (NaCl, table salt), [[sylvite]] (KCl), [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Halite and sylvite commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, and can be dominant minerals in chemical sedimentary rocks. [[Cryolite]], Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is a key mineral in the extraction of aluminium from [[bauxite]]s; however, as the only significant occurrence at [[Ivittuut]], [[Greenland]], in a granitic pegmatite, was depleted, synthetic cryolite can be made from fluorite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 425–30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carbonates====
{{main article|Carbonate minerals}}
The [[carbonate minerals]] are those in which the main anionic group is carbonate, [CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and [[aragonite]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key in the formation of limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and [[karst]] landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is surrounded by three O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt; The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, which is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, can have a high magnesium impurity. Under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph aragonite will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an [[aragonite sea|aragonite]] or [[calcite sea]], depending on which mineral preferentially forms. [[Dolomite]] is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, in which calcite or aragonite are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two mineral species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with the general formula XY(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 668–69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sulfates====
{{main article|Sulfate minerals}}
[[File:Roses des Sables Tunisie.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Gypsum desert rose]]
The [[sulfate mineral]]s all contain the sulfate anion, [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. They tend to be transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfate minerals commonly form as [[evaporite]]s, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters. Sulfates can also be found in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesterman|Lowe|2008}}, pp. 456–57&lt;/ref&gt; or as oxidation products of sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, p. 674&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is [[gypsum]], CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form [[Desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]]s. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is [[anhydrite]]; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include [[barite]] (BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] (SrSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[anglesite]] (PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;); anhydrite is not part of the barite group, as the smaller Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is only in eight-fold coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 672–73&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phosphates====
{{main article|Phosphate minerals}}
The [[phosphate minerals]] are characterized by the tetrahedral [PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; unit, although the structure can be generalized, and phosphorus is replaced by antimony, arsenic, or vanadium. The most common phosphate is the [[apatite]] group; common species within this group are fluorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), chlorapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) and hydroxylapatite (Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)). Minerals in this group are the main crystalline constituents of teeth and bones in vertebrates. The relatively abundant [[monazite]] group has a general structure of ATO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where T is phosphorus or arsenic, and A is often a [[rare-earth element]] (REE). Monazite is important in two ways: first, as a REE "sink", it can sufficiently concentrate these elements to become an ore; secondly, monazite group elements can incorporate relatively large amounts of uranium and thorium, which can be used in [[monazite geochronology]] to date the rock based on the decay of the U and Th to lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyar|Gunter|2008}}, pp. 675–80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organic minerals====
{{main article|Organic mineral}}
The Strunz classification includes a class for [[Strunz classification#Class: organic compounds|organic minerals]]. These rare compounds contain [[Organic compound|organic carbon]], but can be formed by a geologic process. For example, [[whewellite]], CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;⋅H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is an [[oxalate]] that can be deposited in hydrothermal ore veins.

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that [[Biomineralization|biominerals]] could be important indicators of [[extraterrestrial life]] and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on the planet [[Mars]].  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book |editor2-first=David |editor2-last= Beaty |contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory |editor1-first=Andrew |editor1-last=Steele |publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) – NASA |place= |page=72 |date=September 26, 2006 |id= |contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc |format=.doc |accessdate=2009-07-22 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic observation, as a research tool, comes with both advantages and disadvantages that impact its application. By merely observing at a given instance without any manipulation in its natural context, it makes the behaviors exhibited more credible because they are occurring in a real, typical scenario as opposed to an artificial one generated within a lab.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation also allows for study of events that are deemed unethical to study via experimental models, such as the impact of high school shootings on students attending the high school.&lt;ref name="NatObs" /&gt; Naturalistic observation is used in many techniques, from watching an animal's eating patterns in the forest to observing the behavior of students in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/RMPA/naturalisticobservation.html|title=Naturalistic Observation|website=peace.saumag.edu|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''' or '''NbS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management. 

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. 

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles. 

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

These organisations refer to "policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach".&lt;ref name="Cowan3" /&gt;

Likewise, natural infrastructure is defined as a "strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations";&lt;ref name="Smith5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozment6" /&gt; and [[green infrastructure]] refers to an "interconnected network of green spaces that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations".&lt;ref name="Benedict7" /&gt;

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

== Objectives and framing ==

The general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)
17. European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"&gt;Eggermont, H., E. Balian, J. M.N. Azevedo, V. Beumer, T. Brodin, J. Claudet, B. Fady, M. Grube, H. Keune, P. Lamarque, K. Reuter, M. Smitt, C. Van Ham, W.W. Weisser, X. Le Roux. 2015. Nature-based solutions: New influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe. GAIA Ecological Perspectives 24/4: 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services". 

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;" 

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt;]]

In 2015,&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt; the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Projects supported by the European Union ===
Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. 

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6962">'''Outgassing''' (sometimes called '''offgassing''', particularly when in reference to [[indoor air quality]]) is the release of a [[gas]] that was dissolved, trapped, [[freezing|frozen]] or [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] in some material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Strong |  date=1938 | title=[[Procedures in Experimental Physics]] | publisher=Lindsay Publications | location=Bradley, IL | id= }}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Outgassing can include [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] and [[evaporation]] (which are [[phase transition]]s of a substance into a gas), as well as [[desorption]], seepage from cracks or internal volumes, and gaseous products of slow [[chemical reaction]]s. [[Boiling]] is generally thought of as a separate phenomenon from outgassing because it consists of a phase transition of a liquid into a vapor of the same substance.

== In a vacuum ==
Outgassing is a challenge to creating and maintaining clean high-[[vacuum]] environments. [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] maintains a list of low-outgassing materials to be used for spacecraft, as outgassing products can condense onto optical elements, [[thermal radiator]]s, or [[solar cell]]s and obscure them.  Materials not normally considered absorbent can release enough light-weight [[molecule]]s to interfere with industrial or scientific vacuum processes. [[Moisture]], [[sealant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, and [[adhesive]]s are the most common sources, but even [[metal]]s and [[glass]]es can release gases from cracks or impurities. The rate of outgassing increases at higher [[temperature]]s because the [[vapor pressure]] and rate of chemical reaction increases. For most solid materials, the method of manufacture and preparation can reduce the level of outgassing significantly. Cleaning of surfaces, or heating of individual components or the entire assembly (a process called "[[bake-out]]") can drive off volatiles.

NASA's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] spaceprobe suffered [http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/vision.html reduced image quality] due to an unknown contaminant that had condensed on the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] sensor of the navigation camera. A similar problem affected the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spaceprobe's [https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/12954hjpg Narrow Angle Camera], but was corrected by repeatedly heating the system to 4 [[Celsius|°C]]. A comprehensive characterisation of outgassing effects using mass spectrometers could be obtained for ESA's [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;B. Schläppi, et al. (2010), Influence of spacecraft outgassing on the exploration of tenuous atmospheres with in situ mass spectrometry, J. Geophys. Res., 115, A12313, {{doi|10.1029/2010JA015734}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural outgassing is commonplace in [[comet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.5480.pdf]

== From rock ==
Outgassing is a possible source of many tenuous [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of [[terrestrial planets]] or moons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwdAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Outgassing+is+the+source+of+many+tenuous+atmospheres+of+terrestrial+planets+or+moons&amp;dq=Outgassing+is+the+source+of+many+tenuous+atmospheres+of+terrestrial+planets+or+moons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi929OTu8bUAhVH3WMKHW6VDsUQ6AEIJjAA|title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Sciences|last=Shirley|first=J. H.|last2=Fairbridge|first2=Rhodes W.|date=2001-01-31|publisher=[[Springer Netherlands]]|isbn=9780792367949|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many materials are volatile relative to the extreme vacuum of space, such as around the [[Moon]], and may evaporate or even boil at ambient temperature. Materials on the [[lunar surface]] have completely outgassed and been ripped away by [[solar wind]]s long ago, but volatile materials may remain at depth. Once released, gases almost always are less [[Density|dense]] than the surrounding [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[sand]] and seep toward the surface. The [[Atmosphere of the Moon|lunar atmosphere]] probably originates from outgassing of warm material below the surface.  At the Earth's [[Divergent boundary|tectonic divergent boundaries]] where new [[Crust (geology)|crust]] is being created, [[helium]] and [[carbon dioxide]] are some of the volatiles being outgassed from [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[magma]].

== In a closed environment ==
Outgassing can be significant if it collects in a closed environment where air is stagnant or recirculated.  For example, [[new car smell]] consists of outgassed chemicals released by heat in a closed automobile. Even a nearly odorless material such as wood may build up a strong smell if kept in a closed box for months. There is some concern that [[plasticizer]]s and [[solvent]]s released from many industrial products, especially plastics, may be harmful to human health.&lt;ref name="Health Concerns"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Concerns|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/spf/health_concerns_associated_with_chemicals_in_spray_polyurethane_foam_products.html|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term exposure to solvent vapors can cause [[chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy]] (CSE).  Outgassing toxic gases are of great concern in the design of [[submarine]]s and [[space station]]s, which must have self-contained recirculated atmospheres.

== In construction ==
The outgassing of small pockets of air near the surface of setting [[concrete]] can lead to permanent holes in the structure (called [[bughole]]s) that may compromise its structural integrity.&lt;ref name=crb&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.icri.org/PUBLICATIONS/2008/PDFs/janfeb08/CRBJanFeb08_ODea.pdf |title=Thin-Patch Repair of Concrete in Wastewater Environments Using Commercially Available Cementitious Resurfacers |publisher=Concrete Repair Bulletin |date=January 2008 |accessdate=2014-10-21 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=preventing&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.macoatings.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Maintenance_Tips_Preventing_Air-Induced_Coating_Failures_on_Concrete.pdf |title=Preventing Air-Induced Coating Failures on Concrete |publisher=JPCL |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2014-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022083612/http://www.macoatings.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Maintenance_Tips_Preventing_Air-Induced_Coating_Failures_on_Concrete.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Political naturalism''' is a minor [[political ideology]] and [[legal system]] which believes that there is a [[natural law]], just and obvious to all, that crosses ideologies, faiths and personal thinking, that naturally guaranties justice. It is inspired by [[sociological naturalism]], and [[methodological naturalism|scientific naturalism]]'s belief that the precision of [[natural sciences]] can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law.

It may be seen as a natural law-based version of [[Liberal legalism|legalism]]/[[constitutionalism]] (especially [[Constitutionalism#Prescriptive use|of prescriptive constitutionalism]], in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many [[constitutional monarchies]] (as in that system they too believe in [[rule of the law]] and in certain things who are naturally correct (like [[monarchy]], monarchic [[institutions]] and [[traditions]].

The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like [[John Locke]]'s and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s, and even in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence|United States Declaration of Independence]], 1776, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic]] [[Germany|German]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.&lt;ref&gt;He stated that "laws are not made ''but found''", implying the existence of already existing natural laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main modern thinker is [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar and creator of the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri|Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ''«in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles,'' '''the judge shall have recourse to natural law''' ''and the rules of equity.»''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] and modern [[Qatar]]) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the [[Syrian]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[civil codes]] and the [[Kuwait]]i [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

'''Scandiobabingtonite''' was first discovered in the Montecatini granite quarry near [[Baveno]], Italy in a [[pegmatite]] cavity. Though found in pegmatites, the crystals of scandiobabingtonite are sub-millimeter sized, and are tabular shaped. Scandiobabingtonite was the sixth naturally occurring mineral discovered with the rare earth element [[scandium]], and grows around [[babingtonite]], with which it is [[isostructural]], hence the namesake. It is also referred to as scandian babingtonite. The ideal chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH).&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scandiobabingtonite is found in association with [[orthoclase]], [[quartz]], light blue [[albite]], [[stilbite]], [[fluorite]], and [[mica]]. When found with these minerals, the scandiobabingtonite crystals are emplanted on the surface of the other minerals. It also occurs as growth around green-black prismatic crystals of babingtonite. The samples of scandiobabingtonite that have been discovered have shown that they start out growing from a seed of babingtonite crystal. This is how scandiobabingtonite gets its chemical structure. The starting seed of babingtonite is still present in the center of the resulting crystal and can be detected with optical and chemical studies.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt; Scandiobabingtonite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in very small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; It is one of thirteen naturally occurring minerals where scandium is a dominant member. The other scandium minerals are [[bazzite]], [[cascandite]], [[hetftetjernite]], [[jervisite]], [[juonniite]], [[kolbeckite]], [[kristiansenite]], [[magbasite]], [[oftedalite]], [[pretulite]], [[thortveitite]], and [[titanowodginite]].&lt;ref name=scandium /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmineral&gt;webmineral.com, 2015, Mineral species Containing Scandium (Sc): http://webmineral.com/chem/Chem-Sc.shtml#.VmCC6s6przL (accessed December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Scandium can also concentrate in other minerals, such as in [[Mafic|ferromagnesian]] minerals, [[aluminum phosphate]] minerals, [[meteor]]ic minerals, and other minerals containing rare earth elements, but it occurs in trace amounts.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is a colorless or lightly gray-green colored transparent mineral with a glassy or [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous luster]]. It exhibits a hardness of 6 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. Scandiobabingtonite occurs as short, prismatic crystals that are slightly elongated on the [001] [[Miller index|axis]] which gives it a tabular or platy shape. Its crystals are characterized by the {010}, {001}, {110}, {1-10}, and {101} [[Miller Index|faces]].  Scandiobabingtonite is brittle and shows perfect cleavage along the {001} and {1-10} planes. The measured density is 3.24 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. It exhibits a 2V&lt;sub&gt;(measured)&lt;/sub&gt;=64(2)°, strong dispersion with r&gt;v, and displays strong [[pleochroism]] with colors ranging from pink (γ') to green(α'). The extinction angle along the (110) is 6°. Z:Φ=-250°, ρ=47°; Y:Φ=146°, ρ=75°; X:Φ=42°, ρ=47°.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[isostructural]] with babingtonite, and has the same chemical properties as well. It is an [[inosilicate]] with 5-periodic single chains.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scandium replaces the [[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in babingtonite in six-fold coordination. The empirical chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is (Ca&lt;sub&gt;1.71&lt;/sub&gt;,Na&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;,Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;,Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.98&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;5.09&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14.00&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;1.00&lt;/sub&gt;. Simplified, the formula is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
Scandiobabingtonite is in the triclinic crystal system, with space group P1. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.536(2) Å, b=11.734(2) Å, c=6.748(2) Å, α=91.70(2)°, β=93.86(2)°, γ=104.53(2)°. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. The difference in dimensions is caused by the replacement of iron with scandium in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-centered octahedra. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-O distance measures as 2.048 Å, while the Sc-O distance is 2.092 Å. This equates to a slightly larger octahedra in scandiobabingtonite than babingtonite.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

[[File:Sky-3.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The sky above the [[cloud]]s]]

The '''sky''' (or '''celestial dome''') is everything that lies above the surface of the [[Earth]], including the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]].

In the field of [[astronomy]], the sky is also called the [[celestial sphere]]. This is viewed from Earth's surface as an abstract dome on which the [[Sun]], [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and [[Moon]] appear to be [[diurnal motion|traveling]]. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called [[constellation]]s. Usually, the term ''sky'' is used informally as the point of view from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. In some cases, such as in discussing the [[weather]], the sky refers to only the lower, more dense portions of the atmosphere.

During [[daylight]], the sky appears to be [[blue]] because [[air]] [[Rayleigh scattering|scatters]] more blue [[sunlight]] than red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Tyndall | date=December 1868 |title=On the Blue Colour of the Sky, the Polarization of Skylight, and on the Polarization of Light by Cloudy Matter Generally |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |volume=17 |pages=223–233 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1868.0033 |jstor=112380|url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/17/223.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Rayleigh | date=June 1871 |title=On the scattering of light by small particles |journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=41, 275 |pages=447–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.G.

During the day, the Sun can be seen in the sky unless obscured by [[cloud]]s. In the [[night sky]] (and to some extent during the day) the Moon, planets and stars are visible in the sky. Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are [[cloud]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and [[Polar Aurora|aurorae]]. [[Lightning]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] can also be seen in the sky during [[storm]]s. [[Bird]]s, [[insect]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[kite flying|kites]] are often considered to [[Flight|fly]] in the sky. Due to human activities, [[smog]] during the day and [[light pollution]] during the night are often seen above large [[city|cities]].

Except for [[sunlight|light]] that comes directly from the sun, most of the light in the day sky is caused by [[diffuse sky radiation|scattering]], which is dominated by a small-particle limit called [[Rayleigh Scattering]]. The scattering due to [[molecule]] sized particles (as in air) is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=For the non-expert, the relationship between "forward and backward directions" and "the lateral direction" and the spectrum should be made clear.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2x4CAQMEKigC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=molecular+scattering+aerosol+in+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WfVGT-LlFMre0gGpyvH5DQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=molecular%20scattering%20aerosol%20in%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Theoretical Fundamentals of Atmospheric Optics|author=Yu Timofeev|author2=A.

The remaining sunlight,{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What's this? Where? And what is the point of mentioning it}} having lost some of its short wavelength components, appears slightly less blue.&lt;ref name="bluesky" /&gt;

Scattering also occurs even more strongly in [[cloud]]s. Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings.  If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.{{clarify|date=October 2014|reason=What in the world is "a washed-out white color"?}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yi8r4qgMV4C&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=water+droplet+scattering+light+atmosphere&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2f5GT_zMNaiZ0QGX_MiPDg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20droplet%20scattering%20light%20atmosphere&amp;f=false|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric radiation: an introduction with 400 problems|author=Craig F.

The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple and yellow (especially near [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]]) when the light must pass through a much longer path (or [[optical depth]]) through the atmosphere.  Scattering effects also partially [[Polarization (waves)|polarize]] light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90° from the sun.  Scattered light from the [[horizon]] travels through as much as 38 times the atmosphere as does light from the [[zenith]], causing a blue [[Image gradient|gradient]]: vivid at the zenith, and pale near the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/science/wonderquest/2001-04-11-bluer-sky.htm|title=Bluer on top|work=[[USA Today]]|date=11 April 2001|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because red light also scatters if there is enough air between the source and the observer causing parts of the sky to change color during a sunset. As the amount of atmosphere nears infinity, the scattered light appears whiter and whiter.&lt;ref name="Lynch" /&gt;

The sun is not the only object that may appear less blue in the atmosphere. Far away clouds or snowy mountaintops may appear yellowish. The effect is not very obvious on clear days but is very pronounced when clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight.&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=distant+clouds+snow+covered+mountains+appear+yellow+book#v=onepage&amp;q=distant%20clouds%20snow%20covered%20mountains%20appear%20yellow%20book&amp;f=false|title=Color and light in nature|author=David K.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause of that intensity differs as well. When the sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, in twilight, the period of time between sunset and night and between night and sunrise, the situation is more complicated. [[Green flash]]es and green rays are [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] that occur shortly after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]], when a [[green]] spot is visible above the sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes,&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite news | author=Young, A. | url=http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/papers/Zenit/glance.html | title=Green flashes at a glance | date=2006 | work=San Diego State University page | accessdate=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any [[altitude]] (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen at an unobstructed [[horizon]], such as over the [[ocean]], but are also seen over cloud tops and mountain tops. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the [[Moon]] and bright planets, including [[Venus]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nave|first=C.R.|title=Red Sunset, Green Flash|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/redsun.html|work=Georgia State University|publisher=HyperPhysics|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connell|first=D.J.K.|title=The green flash and other low sun phenomena|journal=Castel Gandolfo: Vatican Observatory, Ricerche Astronomiche|date=1958|volume=4|page=7|publisher=Harvard|bibcode=1958RA......4.....O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Earth's shadow]] is the [[shadow]] that the [[Earth]] casts on its [[atmosphere]]. This [[atmospheric phenomenon]] is sometimes seen twice a day, around the times of sunset and sunrise.  When the weather conditions and the observer's viewing point permit a clear sight of the horizon, the shadow can be seen as a dark blue or greyish-blue band. Assuming the sky is clear, the Earth's shadow is visible in the half of the sky opposite to the sunset or sunrise, and is seen as a dark blue band right above the [[horizon]]. A related phenomenon is the "[[Belt of Venus]]" or "anti-twilight arch", a pink band that is visible above the dark blue band of the Earth's shadow in the same part of the sky. There is no clear dividing line between the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus: one colored band shades into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth's shadow|publisher = Les Cowley |author =Les Cowley|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=15 February 2012|url = http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/earshad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=earth-shadow&gt;{{cite book|title=Color and light in nature|author= David K.

Twilight is divided into three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in; it ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun is 6° and 12° below the horizon (heights of between −6° and −12°), after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]], defined as the period from −12° to −18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/twilight/index.htm|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|author=Dr. Irv Bromberg|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012|title=The Duration of Twilight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]], indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

== During the night ==
{{Main|Night sky}}
[[File:Polarlicht 2.jpg|thumb|Aurora borealis over Bear Lake, Alaska]]
[[File:Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a large band across the night sky, and is distorted into an arch in this 360° [[panorama]].]]

The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at [[night]]. The term is usually associated with [[skygazing]] and [[astronomy]], with reference to views of [[celestial bodies]] such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and airglow, depending on location and timing.  The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern [[cultures]].  In the past, for instance, [[farmers]] have used the state of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to plant [[agriculture|crops]].  The [[history of astrology|ancient belief]] in [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on [[Earth]].  The ''scientific'' study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.

Within [[visible-light astronomy]], the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.

=== Tropical cyclones ===
[[File:Tropical cyclone eyewall P-3.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of the sky in the eye of a tropical cyclone]]
Within 36&amp;nbsp;hours of the passage of a [[tropical cyclone]]'s center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the [[cyclone]]'s direction.  Within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the [[bar (tropical cyclone)|bar]] of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18&amp;nbsp;hours of the center's approach, [[squall]]y weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36&amp;nbsp;hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.&lt;ref&gt;[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (23 July 2006).

{{See also|Astrology|Sky father}}

Many mythologies have deities especially associated with the sky.  In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]], the sky was deified as the goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] and as the god [[Horus]]. [[Dyeus]] is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], whence [[Zeus]], the god of the sky and [[thunder]] in [[Greek mythology]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of sky and thunder [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], [[Altjira]] (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In [[Iroquois mythology]], [[Atahensic]] was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deities]].

{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Principles}}
The '''thermoelectric effect''' is the direct conversion of [[temperature]] differences to electric [[voltage]] and vice versa via a [[thermocouple]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_spring2007.web.dir/sedona_price/phys_212_webproj_peltier.html&lt;/ref&gt; A thermoelectric device creates voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference. At the atomic scale, an applied temperature [[gradient]] causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side.

This effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is determined by the polarity of the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.

The term "thermoelectric effect" encompasses three separately identified effects: the '''Seebeck effect''', '''Peltier effect''', and '''Thomson effect'''. The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the '''Peltier–Seebeck effect''' (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] and [[Baltic German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]]). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier–Seebeck model and is credited to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].

[[Joule heating]], the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a resistive material, is related, though it is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect. The Peltier–Seebeck and Thomson effects are [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|thermodynamically reversible]],&lt;ref&gt;As the "figure of merit" approaches infinity, the Peltier–Seebeck effect can drive a heat engine or refrigerator at closer and closer to the [[Heat engine#Efficiency|Carnot efficiency]]. {{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.285.5428.703|title=Thermoelectric Cooling and Power Generation|date=1999|last1=Disalvo|first1=F. J.|journal=Science|volume=285|issue=5428|pages=703–6|pmid=10426986}} Any device that works at the Carnot efficiency is thermodynamically reversible, a consequence of [[Thermodynamics|classical thermodynamics]].&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Joule heating is not.

If the load resistor at the bottom is replaced with a [[voltmeter]], the circuit then functions as a temperature-sensing [[thermocouple]].]]

The '''Seebeck effect''' is the conversion of [[heat]] directly into [[electricity]] at the junction of different types of wire. Originally discovered in 1794 by Italian scientist [[Alessandro Volta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goupil|first1=Christophe|last2=Ouerdane|first2=Henni|last3=Zabrocki|first3=Knud|last4=Seifert|first4=Wolfgang|last5=Hinsche|first5=Nicki F.|last6=Müller|first6=Eckhard|editor1-last=Goupil|editor1-first=Christophe|title=Continuum Theory and Modeling of Thermoelectric Elements|date=2016|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=New York, New York, USA|isbn=9783527413379|pages=2–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XQemCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Thermodynamics and thermoelectricity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 1794, Volta found that if a temperature difference existed between the ends of an iron rod, then it could excite spasms of a frog's leg.  His apparatus consisted of two glasses of water.  Dipped in each glass was a wire that was connected to one or the other hind leg of a frog.  An iron rod was bent into a bow and one end was heated in boiling water.  When the ends of the iron bow were dipped into the two glasses, a thermoelectric current passed through the frog's legs and caused them to twitch.  See:

This was because the electron energy levels in each metal shifted differently and a [[potential difference]] between the junctions created an electrical current and therefore a [[magnetic field]] around the wires. Seebeck did not recognize that there was an electric current involved, so he called the phenomenon "thermomagnetic effect". Danish physicist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] rectified the oversight and coined the term "thermoelectricity".&lt;ref&gt;See:

The Seebeck effect is a classic example of an [[electromotive force]] (emf) and leads to measurable currents or voltages in the same way as any other emf. Electromotive forces modify [[Ohm's law]] by generating currents even in the absence of voltage differences (or vice versa); the local [[current density]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = \sigma (-\nabla V + \mathbf E_\text{emf}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[voltage]],&lt;ref&gt;The voltage in this case does not refer to electric potential but rather the "voltmeter" voltage &lt;math&gt;V = -\mu/e&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi level]].&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the local [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. In general, the Seebeck effect is described locally by the creation of an electromotive field

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_\text{emf} = -S \nabla T,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (also known as thermopower), a property of the local material, and  &lt;math&gt;\nabla T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient.

The Seebeck coefficients generally vary as function of temperature and depend strongly on the composition of the conductor. For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from −100&amp;nbsp;μV/K to +1,000&amp;nbsp;μV/K (see [[Seebeck coefficient]] article for more information).

If the system reaches a steady state, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the voltage gradient is given simply by the emf: &lt;math&gt;-V = S \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;. This simple relationship, which does not depend on conductivity, is used in the [[thermocouple]] to measure a temperature difference; an absolute temperature may be found by performing the voltage measurement at a known reference temperature. A metal of unknown composition can be classified by its thermoelectric effect if a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature. It is used commercially to identify metal alloys. Thermocouples in series form a [[thermopile]]. [[Thermoelectric generator]]s are used for creating power from heat differentials.

== Peltier effect ==
[[File:Thermoelectric Cooler Diagram.svg|thumb|The Seebeck circuit configured as a [[Thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric cooler]]]]

The '''Peltier effect''' is the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors and is named after French physicist [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]], who discovered it in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peltier|title=Nouvelles expériences sur la caloricité des courants électrique|journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|date=1834|volume=56|pages=371–386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA371#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|trans-title=New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = (\Pi_\text{A} - \Pi_\text{B}) I,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).

The Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the [[Counter-electromotive force|back-emf]] in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: &lt;math&gt;\Pi = T S&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]).

A typical Peltier [[heat pump]] involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do [[thermoelectric cooling]] devices found in refrigerators.

== Thomson effect ==
In different materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This '''Thomson effect''' was predicted and subsequently observed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (William Thomson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On a mechanical theory of thermo-electric currents|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1851|volume=3|issue=42|pages=91–98|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/19876#page/111/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes the heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient.

If a current density &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt; is passed through a homogeneous conductor, the Thomson effect predicts a heat production rate per unit volume

:&lt;math&gt;\dot q = -\mathcal K \mathbf J \cdot \nabla T,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature gradient, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K&lt;/math&gt; is the Thomson coefficient. The Thomson coefficient is related to the Seebeck coefficient as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K = T \tfrac{dS}{dT}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[#Thomson relations|below]]). This equation, however, neglects Joule heating and ordinary thermal conductivity (see full equations below).

== Full thermoelectric equations ==

{{see also|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}

Often, more than one of the above effects is involved in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; the effects of [[Joule heating]] and ordinary heat conduction are included as well. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation&lt;ref name="fsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~dommelen/quantum/style_a/nt_pelt.html |title=A.11 Thermoelectric effects |publisher=Eng.fsu.edu |date=2002-02-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf J = \sigma (-\boldsymbol \nabla V - S \nabla T).&lt;/math&gt;

To describe the Peltier and Thomson effects the flow of energy must be considered. To start, the dynamic case where both temperature and charge may be varying with time can be considered. The full thermoelectric equation for the energy accumulation, &lt;math&gt;\dot e&lt;/math&gt;, is&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot e = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) - \nabla \cdot (V + \Pi) \mathbf J + \dot q_\text{ext},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]]. The first term is the [[Thermal conduction#Fourier's law|Fourier's heat conduction law]], and the second term shows the energy carried by currents. The third term, &lt;math&gt;\dot q_\text{ext}&lt;/math&gt;, is the heat added from an external source (if applicable).

In the case where the material has reached a steady state, the charge and temperature distributions are stable, so one must have both &lt;math&gt;\dot e = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf J = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Using these facts and the second Thomson relation (see below), the heat equation then can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;-\dot q_\text{ext} = \nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) + \mathbf J \cdot \left(\sigma^{-1} \mathbf J\right) - T \mathbf J \cdot \nabla S.&lt;/math&gt;

The middle term is the Joule heating, and the last term includes both Peltier (&lt;math&gt;\nabla S&lt;/math&gt; at junction) and Thomson (&lt;math&gt;\nabla S&lt;/math&gt; in thermal gradient) effects. Combined with the Seebeck equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf J&lt;/math&gt;, this can be used to solve for the steady-state voltage and temperature profiles in a complicated system.

If the material is not in a steady state, a complete description will also need to include dynamic effects such as relating to electrical capacitance, inductance, and heat capacity.

==Thomson relations==

{{see also|Onsager reciprocal relations|Heat transfer physics#Electron}}

In 1854, Lord Kelvin found relationships between the three coefficients, implying that the Thomson, Peltier, and Seebeck effects are different manifestations of one effect (uniquely characterized by the Seebeck coefficient).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=William|title=On the dynamical theory of heat. Part V. Thermo-electric currents|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|date=1854|volume=21|pages=123–171|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/126375#page/147/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Thomson relation is&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal K \equiv \frac{d\Pi}{dT} - S,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute temperature, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K&lt;/math&gt; is the Thomson coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is the Peltier coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the Seebeck coefficient. This relationship is easily shown given that the Thomson effect is a continuous version of the Peltier effect. Using the second relation (described next), the first Thomson relation becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K = T \tfrac{dS}{dT}&lt;/math&gt;.

The second Thomson relation is

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi = TS.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation expresses a subtle and fundamental connection between the Peltier and Seebeck effects. It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the [[Onsager reciprocal relations|Onsager relations]], and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered ([[ferromagnetic]], [[antiferromagnetic]], etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.&lt;ref&gt;There is a generalized second Thomson relation relating anisotropic Peltier and Seebeck coefficients with reversed magnetic field and magnetic order. See, for example, {{cite book| isbn = 9781420038903| title = Thermoelectrics Handbook: Macro to Nano| editor1-last = Rowe| editor1-first= D. M. | date = 2010 | publisher = [[CRC Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thomson coefficient is unique among the three main thermoelectric coefficients because it is the only one directly measurable for individual materials. The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.

If the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material. For more details on absolute Seebeck coefficient determination, see [[Seebeck coefficient]].

==Applications==
{{see also|Thermoelectric materials}}

===Thermoelectric generators===
{{main|Thermoelectric generator}}

The Seebeck effect is used in thermoelectric generators, which function like [[heat engine]]s, but are less bulky, have no moving parts, and are typically more expensive and less efficient. They have a use in power plants for converting [[waste heat]] into additional electrical power (a form of [[energy recycling]]) and in automobiles as [[automotive thermoelectric generator]]s (ATGs) for increasing [[fuel efficiency]]. Space probes often use [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s with the same mechanism but using radioisotopes to generate the required heat difference.
Recent uses include stove fans,&lt;ref&gt;"https://stovefanreviews.com/teg-module-and-seebeck-effect/"&lt;/ref&gt; body-heat—powered lighting&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.gizmag.com/lumen-flashlight/39893/&lt;/ref&gt; and a smartwatch powered by body heat.&lt;ref&gt;"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602874/body-heat-powers-this-smart-watch"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peltier effect ===
{{Main|Thermoelectric cooling}}
The Peltier effect can be used to create a [[refrigerator]] that is compact and has no circulating fluid or moving parts. Such refrigerators are useful in applications where their advantages outweigh the disadvantage of their very low efficiency. The Peltier effect is also used by many [[thermal cyclers]], laboratory devices used to amplify DNA by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR requires the cyclic heating and cooling of samples to specified temperatures. The inclusion of many thermocouples in a small space enables many samples to be amplified in parallel.

===Temperature measurement===
{{Main|Thermocouple}}
[[Thermocouple]]s and [[thermopile]]s are devices that use the Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two objects.
Thermocouples are often used to measure high temperatures, holding the temperature of one junction constant or measuring it independently ([[thermocouple|cold junction compensation]]). Thermopiles use many thermocouples electrically connected in series, for sensitive measurements of very small temperature difference.

Voigts, B. Schaff &amp;M. Pietrzak-Franger (Eds.). Reflecting on Darwin. Farnham, London: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of [[Darwinism]] beyond its original domain of [[biological evolution]] on Earth. Universal Darwinism aims to formulate a generalized version of the mechanisms of [[Genetic diversity|variation]], [[natural selection|selection]] and [[heredity]] proposed by [[Charles Darwin]], so that they can apply to explain [[Evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] in a wide variety of other domains, including [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[culture]], [[medicine]], [[computer science]] and [[physics]].

==Basic mechanisms==
At the most fundamental level, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] states that organisms evolve and [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environment by an iterative process.  This process can be conceived as an [[evolutionary algorithm]] that searches the space of possible forms (the [[fitness landscape]]) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components:

* [[Genetic diversity|variation]] of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by [[mutation]] or [[genetic recombination|recombination]].
* [[Selection (biology)|selection]] of the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated.
* [[heredity]] or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring.

After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the [[iteration]]. The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of [[trial-and-error]] or generate-and-test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem  of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes.

The generalization made in "universal" Darwinism is to replace "organism" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can "survive" (maintain, be retained) long enough or "reproduce" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there  is a selective "preference" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce "better" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms.

Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are [[genes]], ideas ([[memes]]), theories, technologies, [[neurons]] and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, [[antibodies]], institutions, law and judicial systems, quantum states and even whole universes.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (2009).

&lt;/ref&gt; but was still lacking the concept of natural selection. Darwin himself, together with subsequent 19th century thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[James Mark Baldwin]] and [[William James]], was quick to apply the idea of selection to other domains, such as language, psychology, society, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, G. M. (2005). Generalizing Darwinism to social evolution: Some early attempts. Journal of economic issues, 899–914&lt;/ref&gt; However, this evolutionary tradition was largely banned from the social sciences in the beginning of the 20th century, in part because of the bad reputation of [[social Darwinism]], an attempt to use Darwinism to justify social inequality.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Starting in the 1950s, [[Donald T. Campbell]] was one of  the first and most influential authors to revive the tradition, and to formulate a generalized Darwinian [[algorithm]] directly applicable to phenomena outside of biology.&lt;ref&gt;Gontier, N. (2006). Evolutionary Epistemology. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/evo-epis/&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he was inspired by [[William Ross Ashby]]'s view of [[self-organization]] and intelligence as fundamental processes of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T. (1960). Blind variation and selective retention in creative thought as in other knowledge processes. Psychological Review, 67(6), 380–400.&lt;/ref&gt; His aim was to explain the development of [[science]] and other forms of [[knowledge]] by focusing on the variation and selection of ideas and theories, thus laying the basis for the domain of [[evolutionary epistemology]]. In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of "blind-variation-and-selective-retention" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of "universal selection theory"&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D.

[[Richard Dawkins]] may have first coined the term "universal Darwinism" in 1983 to describe his conjecture that any possible life forms existing outside the solar system would evolve by natural selection just as they do on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R. (1983) Universal Darwinism. In: Evolution from molecules to man, ed. D.&amp;nbsp;S. Bendall. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture was also presented in 1983 in a paper entitled “The Darwinian Dynamic” that dealt with the evolution of order in living systems and certain nonliving physical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RA, Vemulapalli GK. (1983) The Darwinian Dynamic. Quarterly Review of Biology 58, 185-207.  {{jstor|2828805}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was suggested “that ‘life’, wherever it might exist in the universe, evolves according to the same dynamical law” termed the Darwinian dynamic.  [[Henry Plotkin]] in his 1997 book&lt;ref&gt;Plotkin, H. C. (1997). Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Darwin machines]] makes the link between universal Darwinism and Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. [[Susan Blackmore]], in her 1999 book ''[[The Meme Machine]]'', devotes a chapter titled 'Universal Darwinism' to a discussion of the applicability of the Darwinian process to a wide range of scientific subject matters.

The philosopher of mind [[Daniel Dennett]], in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', developed the idea of a Darwinian process, involving variation, selection and retention, as a generic algorithm that is substrate-neutral and could be applied to many fields of knowledge outside of biology. He described the idea of natural selection as a "universal acid" that cannot be contained in any vessel, as it seeps through the walls and spreads ever further, touching and transforming ever more domains. He notes in particular the field of [[memetics]] in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel C. (2005), Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Touchstone Press, New York. pp. 352&amp;ndash;360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In agreement with Dennett's prediction, over the past decades the Darwinian perspective has spread ever more widely, in particular across the [[social sciences]] as the foundation for numerous schools of study including [[memetics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[neural Darwinism]], and [[evolutionary linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Oudeyer, P.-Y. and Kaplan, F. (2007) [http://www.pyoudeyer.com/oudeyer-kaplan-cp07.pdf Language Evolution as a Darwinian Process: Computational Studies]. Cognitive Processing, 8(1):21&amp;ndash;35&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have postulated Darwinian processes as operating at the foundations of physics, cosmology and chemistry via the theories of [[quantum Darwinism]],&lt;ref&gt;

Author D. B. Kelley has formulated one of the most all-encompassing approaches to Universal Darwinism. In his 2013 book ''The Origin of Everything'', he holds that [[natural selection]] involves not the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, as shown by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], but the preservation of favored systems in contention for existence. The fundamental mechanism behind all such stability and evolution is therefore what Kelley calls "[[survival of the fittest]] systems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origin of Everything via Universal Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Systems in Contention for Existence|last=Kelley|first=D. B.|publisher=Woodhollow Press|year=2013|isbn=0985462507|location=Newbury, Ohio|pages=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all systems are cyclical, the Darwinian processes of [[iteration]], variation and [[Natural selection|selection]] are operative not only among species but among all natural phenomena both large-scale and small. Kelley thus maintains that, since the [[Big Bang]] especially, the [[universe]] has evolved from a highly chaotic state to one that is now highly ordered with many stable phenomena, naturally selected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
==Examples of universal Darwinist theories==
The following approaches can all be seen as exemplifying a generalization of Darwinian ideas outside of their original domain of biology. These "Darwinian extensions" can be grouped in two categories, depending on whether they discuss implications of biological (genetic) evolution in other disciplines (e.g. medicine or psychology), or discuss processes of variation and selection of entities other than genes (e.g. computer programs, firms or ideas). However, there is no strict separation possible, since most of these approaches (e.g. in sociology, psychology and linguistics) consider both genetic and non-genetic (e.g. cultural) aspects of evolution, as well as the interactions between them (see e.g. [[gene-culture coevolution]]).

*[[Paleolithic diet]] proposes that the most healthy nutrition is the one to which our hunter-gatherer ancestors have adapted over millions of years
*[[Paleolithic lifestyle]] generalizes the paleolithic diet to include exercise, behavior and exposure to the environment
*[[Molecular evolution]] studies evolution at the level of DNA, RNA and proteins
*[[Biosocial criminology]] studies crime using several different approaches that include genetics and evolutionary psychology
*[[Evolutionary linguistics]] studies the evolution of language, biologically as well as culturally&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, August. ''Darwinism Tested by the Science of Language.'' (Transl. by Alexander V. W. Bikkers) London, J. C. Hotten (1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Darwinian extensions===
*[[Quantum Darwinism]] sees the emergence of classical states in physics as a natural selection of the most stable quantum properties
*[[Cosmological natural selection]] hypothesizes that universes reproduce and are selected for having fundamental constants that maximize "fitness"
*[[Complex adaptive systems]] models the dynamics of complex systems in part on the basis of the variation and selection of its components
*[[Evolutionary computation]] is a Darwinian approach to the generation of adapted computer programs
*[[Genetic algorithms]], a subset of evolutionary computation, models variation by "genetic" operators (mutation and recombination)

*[[Memetics]] is a theory of the variation, transmission, and selection of cultural items, such as ideas, fashions, and traditions
*[[Dual inheritance theory]] a framework for cultural evolution developed largely independently of [[memetics]]
*[[Cultural selection theory]] is a theory of cultural evolution related to [[memetics]]
*[[Evolutionary economics]] studies the variation and selection of economic phenomena, such as commodities, technologies, institutions and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozawa, Y. 2004 Evolutionary Economics in the 21st Century: A Manifesto, ''Evolutionary and  Institutional Economics Review,'' '''1'''(1): 5-47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Evolutionary ethics]] investigates the origin of morality, and uses Darwinian foundations to formulate ethical values
*[[Big History]] is the science-based narrative integrating the history of the universe, earth, life, and humanity. Scholars consider Universal Darwinism to be a possible unifying theme for the discipline. &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D. The Darwinian Algorithm and a possible candidate for a unifying theme of Big History. http://www.sociostudies.org/almanac/articles/10_500_the_darwinian_algorithm_and_a_possible_candidate_for_a_-unifying_theme-_of_big_histo/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1039">'''Zeeman energy''', or the external field energy, is the potential energy of a magnetised body in an external magnetic field. It is named after the Dutch physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]], primarily known by the [[Zeeman effect]]. In SI units, it is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm Zeeman} =-\mu_{0} \int_V\,\textbf M\cdot \textbf H_{\rm Ext} \, \mathrm dV&lt;/math&gt;

where H&lt;sub&gt;Ext&lt;/sub&gt; is the external field, M the local magnetisation, and the integral is done over the volume of the body. This is the statistical average (over a 
unit volume macroscopic sample) of a corresponding microscopic Hamiltonial (energy) for each individual [[magnetic moment]] '''m''', which is however experiencing a ''local'' induction '''B''':

:&lt;math&gt;H =-\textbf m \cdot \textbf B &lt;/math&gt;
