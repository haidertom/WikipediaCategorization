'''Analytica''' is a visual software package developed by Lumina Decision Systems for creating, analyzing and communicating quantitative decision models.&lt;ref&gt;Granger Morgan and Max Henrion (1998), [http://www.lumina.com/software/ch10.9.PDF Analytica:A Software Tool for Uncertainty Analysis and Model Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630125258/http://www.lumina.com/software/ch10.9.PDF |date=June 30, 2007 }}, Chapter 10 of ''Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis'', second edition, Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a modeling environment, it is interesting in the way it combines hierarchical [[influence diagram]]s for visual creation and view of models, intelligent arrays for working with multidimensional data, [[Monte Carlo simulation]] for analyzing risk and uncertainty, and [[optimization]], including linear and nonlinear programming. Its design, especially its influence diagrams and treatment of uncertainty, is based on ideas from the field of [[decision analysis]]. As a computer language, it is notable in combining a declarative (non-procedural) structure for referential transparency, array abstraction, and automatic dependency maintenance for efficient sequencing of computation.

== Hierarchical influence diagrams ==
Analytica models are organized as [[influence diagram]]s.  Variables (and other objects) appear as nodes of various shapes on a diagram, connected by arrows that provide a visual representation of dependencies.  Analytica influence diagrams may be hierarchical, in which a single ''module'' node on a diagram represents an entire submodel.

Hierarchical influence diagrams in Analytica serve as a key organizational tool.  Because the visual layout of an influence diagram matches these natural human abilities both spatially and in the level of abstraction, people are able to take in far more information about a model's structure and organization at a glance than is possible with less visual paradigms, such as [[spreadsheet]]s and [[mathematical expression]]s.  Managing the structure and organization of a large model can be a significant part of the modeling process, but is substantially aided by the visualization of influence diagrams.

Influence diagrams also serve as a tool for communication.  Once a quantitative model has been created and its final results computed, it is often the case that an understanding of how the results are obtained, and how various assumptions impact the results, is far more important than the specific numbers computed.  The ability of a target audience to understand these aspects is critical to the modeling enterprise.  The visual representation of an influence diagram quickly communicates an understanding at a level of abstraction that is normally more appropriate than detailed representations such as mathematical expressions or cell formulae.  When more detail is desired, users can drill down to increasing levels of detail, speeded by the visual depiction of the model's structure.

The existence of an easily understandable and transparent model supports communication and debate within an organization, and this effect is one of the primary benefits of investing in quantitative model building.  When all interested parties are able to understand a common model structure, debates and discussions will often focus more directly on specific assumptions, can cut down on "cross-talk", and therefore lead to more productive interactions within the organization.  The influence diagram serves as a graphical representation that can help to make models accessible to people at different levels.

== Intelligent multidimensional arrays ==

Analytica uses index objects to track the dimensions of multidimensional arrays. An index object has a name and a list of elements.  When two multidimensional values are combined, for example in an expression such as

:&lt;code&gt;Profit = Revenue − Expenses&lt;/code&gt;

where ''Revenue'' and ''Expenses'' are each multidimensional, Analytica repeats the profit calculation over each dimension, but recognizes when same dimension occurs in both values and treats it as the same dimension during the calculation, in a process called ''intelligent array abstraction''.  Unlike most programming languages, there is no inherent ordering to the dimensions in a multidimensional array. This avoids duplicated formulas and explicit FOR loops, both common sources of modeling errors. The simplified expressions made possible by intelligent array abstraction allow the model to be more accessible, interpretable, and transparent.

Another consequence of intelligent array abstraction is that new dimensions can be introduced or removed from an existing model, without requiring changes to the model structure or changes to variable definitions.  For example, while creating a model, the model builder might assume a particular variable, for example ''[[discounted cash flow|discount_rate]]'', contains a single number.  Later, after constructing a model, a user might replace the single number with a table of numbers, perhaps ''discount_rate'' broken down by ''Country'' and by ''Economic_scenario''.  These new divisions may reflect the fact that the effective discount rate is not the same for international divisions of a company, and that different rates are applicable to different hypothetical scenarios.  Analytica automatically propagates these new dimensions to any results that depend upon ''discount_rate'', so for example, the result for ''[[Net present value]]'' will become multidimensional and contain these new dimensions.  In essence, Analytica repeats the same calculation using the discount rate for each possible combination of ''Country'' and ''Economic_scenario''.

This flexibility is important when exploring computation tradeoffs between the level of detail, computation time, available data, and overall size or dimensionality of parametric spaces. Such adjustments are common after models have been fully constructed as a way of exploring ''[[What-if analysis|what-if]]'' scenarios and overall relationships between variables.

== Uncertainty analysis ==

Incorporating uncertainty into model outputs helps to provide more realistic and informative projections. Uncertain quantities in Analytica can be specified using a [[probability distribution|distribution function]]. When evaluated, distributions are sampled using either [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercube]] or [[Monte Carlo simulation|Monte Carlo]] sampling, and the samples are propagated through the computations to the results.  The sampled result distribution and summary statistics can then be viewed directly ([[mean]], [[quantile|fractile bands]], [[probability density function]] (PDF), [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF)), Analytica supports collaborative decision analysis and [[probability management]] through the use of the SIPMath(tm) standard.&lt;ref&gt;The SIPmath&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Standard

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Kaplan and Sam Savage (2011), [http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/IWM11MarApr_MonteCarlo.pdf Monte Carlo, A Lightbulb for Illuminating Uncertainty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307150357/http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/IWM11MarApr_MonteCarlo.pdf |date=2017-03-07 }}, in Investments &amp; Wealth Monitor&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems dynamics modeling ==

[[System dynamics]] is an approach to simulating the behaviour of complex systems over time. It deals with feedback loops and time delays on the behaviour of the entire system. The Dynamic() function in Analytica allows definition of variables with cyclic dependencies, such as feedback loops. It expands the [[influence diagram]] notation, which does not normally allow cycles. At least one link in each cycle includes a time lag, depicted as a gray influence arrow to distinguish it from standard black arrows without time lags.

== As a programming language ==

Analytica includes a general language of operators and functions for expressing mathematical relationships among variables. Users can define functions and libraries to extend the language.

Analytica has several features as a [[programming language]] designed to make it easy to use for quantitative modeling: It is a [[visual programming languages|visual programming language]], where users view programs (or "models") as [[influence diagrams]], which they create and edit visually by adding and linking nodes. It is a [[declarative programming language|declarative language]], meaning that a model declares a definition for each variable without specifying an execution sequence as required by conventional [[imperative programming language|imperative languages]]. Analytica determines a correct and efficient execution sequence using the dependency graph. It is a [[referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]] [[functional programming language|functional language]], in that execution of functions and variables have no side effects i.e. changing other variables. Analytica is an [[array programming]] language, where operations and functions generalize to work on multidimensional arrays.

== Applications of Analytica ==

Analytica has been used for [[policy analysis]], [[Business Analysis|business modeling]], and [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jun Long, Baruch Fischhoff (2000), [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0272-4332.203033 ''Setting Risk Priorities: A Formal Model Risk Analysis''], Risk Analysis 20(3):339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas in which Analytica has been applied include energy,&lt;ref&gt;Stadler M., Marnay C., Azevedo I.L., Komiyama R., Lai J.

The Analytica software runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.  Three editions (Professional, Enterprise, Optimizer) each with more functions and cost, are purchased by users interested in building models. A free edition is available, called Analytica Free 101, which allows you to build medium to moderate sized models of up to 101 user objects.. Free 101 also allows you to view models with more than 101 objects, change inputs, and compute results, which enables free sharing of models for review. A more capable but non-free Power Player enables users to save inputs and utilize database connections. The Analytica Cloud Player allows you to share models over the web and lets users access and run via a web browser.

The most recent release of Analytica is version 5.1, released in May 2018.

== History ==

Analytica's predecessor, called ''Demos'',&lt;ref&gt;
Neil Wishbow and Max Henrion, "Demos User's Manual", Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; grew from the research on tools for [[policy analysis]] by Max Henrion as a PhD student and later professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] between 1979 and 1990.  Henrion founded Lumina Decision Systems in 1991 with Brian Arnold.  Lumina continued to develop the software and apply it to environmental and public policy analysis applications.  Lumina first released Analytica as a product in 1996.

'''Apostolos K. Doxiadis''' ({{lang-el|Απόστολος Κ. Δοξιάδης}}; born 1953) is a Greek writer. He is best known for his international bestsellers ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (2000) and ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009).

==Early life==
Doxiadis was born in Australia, where his father, the architect [[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis]] was working. Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City|New York]], from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in May 1972. He then attended the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in [[Paris]] from which he got a master's degree, with a thesis on the mathematical modeling of the nervous system. His father’s death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies. In Greece, although involved for some years with the computer software industry, Doxiadis returned to his childhood and adolescence loves of theatre and the cinema, before becoming a full-time writer.

==Work==

===Fiction in Greek===
Doxiadis began to write in Greek. His first published work was ''A Parallel Life'' (''Βίος Παράλληλος'', 1985), a novella set in the monastic communities of 4th century CE Egypt. His first novel, ''Makavettas'' (''Μακαβέττας'', 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of [[Yannis Makriyannis]], it follows the plot of Shakespeare’s ''[[Macbeth]]'', of which the eponymous hero’s name is a Hellenized form. Doxiadis next novel, ''Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture'' (''Ο Θείος Πέτρος και η Εικασία του Γκόλντμπαχ'', 1992), was the first long work of fiction whose plot takes place in the world of pure mathematics research. The first Greek critics did not find the mathematical themes appealing, and it received mediocre reviews, unlike Doxiadis’s first two works, which were well received. Τhe novella ''The Three Little Men'' (''Τα Τρία Ανθρωπάκια'', 1998), attempts a modern-day retelling of the tale of a classic fairy-tale.

===Fiction in English===
In 1998, Doxiadis translated into English, significantly re-working, his third novel, which was published in England in 2000 as ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (UK publisher: [[Faber and Faber]]; United States publisher: [[Bloomsbury USA]].) The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel Laureate [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]], British mathematician [[Sir Michael Atiyah]], critic [[George Steiner]] and psychiatrist [[Oliver Sacks]]. ''Uncle Petros'' is one of the ''[[1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://1001beforeyoudie.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110124836/http://1001beforeyoudie.com/ |date=2014-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Doxiadis’ next project, which took over five years to complete, was the graphic novel ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009), a number one bestseller on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]] and an international bestseller, already published in over twenty languages. ''Logicomix'' was co-authored with computer scientist [[Christos Papadimitriou]], with art work by [[Alecos Papadatos]] (pencils) and Annie Di Donna (color). Renowned comics historian and critic R. C. Harvey, in the ''[[Comics Journal]]'', called ''Logicomix'' “a tour-de-force” a “virtuoso performance”,&lt;ref&gt;http://classic.tcj.com/history/logicomix-a-tour-de-force/&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Sunday Times]]''’ Brian Appleyard called it “probably the best and certainly the most extraordinary graphic novel” he has read. ''Logicomix'' is one of Paul Gravett’s ''1001 Comics You Must Read Before you Die.'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/1001_comics/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
In the early stage of his career, Doxiadis directed in the professional theatre, in Athens, and worked as translator, translating, among other plays, [[William Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', as well as [[Eugene O’Neill]]’s ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]''.

He has written two plays for the theatre. The first was a full-length shadow-puppet play ''The Tragical History of Jackson Pollock, Abstract Expressionist'' (1999), in English, of which he also designed and directed the Athens performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watch a performance, filmed by Doxiadis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJMyQ4Bkiow&lt;/ref&gt; In this play, Doxiadis realized some of his views on “epic theatre”, in other words a theatre based on storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Read his own views on the matter in an interview: http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=94{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second play, ''Incompleteness'' (2005), is an imaginary account of the last seventeen days in the life of the great logician [[Kurt Gödel]], which Gödel spent in a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital, refusing to eat out of fear that he was being poisoned. The play was staged in Athens, in 2006, as Dekati Evdomi Nyhta (Seventeenth Night) with the actor Yorgos Kotanidis in the role of Kurt Gödel.

Doxiadis has also written and directed two feature-length films, in Greek, ''Underground Passage'' (''Υπόγεια Διαδρομή'', 1983) and ''Terirem'' (''Τεριρέμ'', 1987). The latter won the [[CICAE]] (International Confederation of Art Cinemas) prize for Best Film in the 1988 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

===Scholarship===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6593">'''Backtesting''' is a term used in modeling to refer to testing a [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] on historical data.  Backtesting is a type of [[retrodiction]], and a special type of [[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] applied to previous time period(s).

== Financial analysis==
In a trading strategy, investment strategy, or risk modeling, backtesting seeks to estimate the performance of a strategy or model if it had been employed during a past period. This requires simulating past conditions with sufficient detail, making one limitation of backtesting the need for detailed historical data.  A second limitation is the inability to model strategies that would affect historic prices. Finally, backtesting, like other modeling, is limited by potential [[overfitting]]. That is, it is often possible to find a strategy that would have worked well in the past, but will not work well in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does Backtesting Really Work?|url=http://www.backtestbroker.com/backtestingfaq.aspx|author=BacktestBroker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limitations, backtesting provides information not available when models and strategies are tested on synthetic data.

Backtesting has historically only been performed by large institutions and professional money managers due to the expense of obtaining and using detailed datasets. However, backtrading is increasingly used on a wider basis, and independent web-based backtesting platforms have emerged. Although the technique is widely used, it is prone to weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Issues related to back testing|url=http://www.financialtrading.com/issues-related-to-back-testing/|author=FinancialTrading}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basel Accords|Basel financial regulations]] require large financial institutions to backtest certain risk models.

Hindcasting usually refers to a [[computer simulation|numerical-model]] integration of a historical period where no observations have been [[data assimilation|assimilated]]. This distinguishes a hindcast run from a [[meteorological reanalysis|reanalysis]]. Oceanographic observations of [[salinity]] and [[temperature]] as well as observations of [[ocean surface wave|surface-wave parameters]] such as the [[significant wave height]] are much scarcer than meteorological observations, making hindcasting more common in oceanography than in meteorology. Also, since surface waves represent a forced system where the wind is the only generating force, [[wind wave model|wave hindcasting]] is often considered adequate for generating a reasonable representation of the wave [[climate]] with little need for a full reanalysis. Hydrologists use hindcasting for model stream flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Guidance on Conducting  Streamflow Hindcasting in  CHPS|url= http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/water/RFC_support/HEFS_doc/Streamflow_Hindcasting_Guidance_V3.pdf|publisher= NOAA|accessdate= 22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of hindcasting would be entering [[climate]] forcings (events that force change) into a [[climate model]]. If the hindcast showed reasonably-accurate climate response, the model would be considered successful.

The [[ECMWF re-analysis]] is an example of a combined atmospheric reanalysis coupled with a wave-model integration where no wave parameters were assimilated, making the wave part a hindcast run.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;
Not only did hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance, or to some other "chaotic" event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">The '''Bateman Manuscript Project''' was a major effort at collation and encyclopedic compilation of the mathematical theory of [[special functions]]. It resulted in the eventual publication of five important reference volumes, under the editorship of [[Arthur Erdélyi]].

==Overview==
The theory of special functions was a core activity of the field of [[applied mathematics]], from the middle of the nineteenth century to the advent of high-speed [[electronic computing]]. The intricate properties of [[spherical harmonics]], [[elliptic function]]s and other staples of problem-solving in [[mathematical physics]], [[astronomy]] and right across the [[physical sciences]], are not easy to document completely, absent a theory explaining the inter-relationships. [[Mathematical table]]s to perform actual calculations needed to mesh with an adequate theory of how functions could be transformed into those already tabulated.

[[Harry Bateman]], a distinguished applied mathematician, undertook the somewhat [[Quixotism|quixotic]] task of trying to collate the content of the very large literature. On his death in 1946, his papers on this project were still in a uniformly rough state. The publication of the edited version provided special functions texts more up-to-date than, for example, the classic [[Whittaker &amp; Watson]].

The volumes were out of print for many years, and copyright in the works reverted to the [[California Institute of Technology]], who renewed them in the early 1980s.  [[Dover Publications|Dover]] planned to  reprint them for publication in 2007 but this never occurred {{Citation needed|reason=Is there any written statement on this plan?.|date=October 2016}}.  In 2011, the California Institute of Technology gave permission for scans of the volumes to be made publicly available (see References).

Other mathematicians involved in the project include [[Wilhelm Magnus]].

In mathematics, a '''canonical map''', also called a '''natural map''', is a map or morphism between objects that arises naturally from the definition or the construction of the objects being mapped against each other. In general it is the map which preserves the widest amount of structure, and it tends to be unique. In the rare cases where latitude in choice remains, the map is either conventionally agreed upon to be the most useful for further analysis, or sometimes simply the most elegant or beautiful known.

A closely related notion is a '''structure map''' or '''structure morphism'''; the map that comes with the given structure on the object. They are also sometimes called canonical maps.

A [[canonical isomorphism]] is a canonical map that is also an isomorphism (i.e., invertible).

In some contexts, it is necessary to address an issue of ''choices'' of canonical maps or canonical isomorphisms; see [[prestack#Definition|prestack]] for a typical example.

==Examples==
*If ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of a group ''G'', then there is a canonical map from ''G'' to the [[quotient group]] ''G/N'' that sends an element ''g'' to the coset that ''g'' belongs to.
*If ''V'' is a [[vector space]], then there is a canonical map from ''V'' to the second [[dual space]] of ''V'' that sends a vector ''v'' to the linear functional ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = λ(''v'').
*If ''f'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] from a commutative ring ''R'' to commutative ring ''S'', then ''S'' can be viewed as an [[algebra over a ring|algebra]] over ''R''. The ring homomorphism ''f'' is then called the structure map (for the algebra structure). The corresponding map on the [[prime spectrum|prime spectra]]: Spec(''S'') →Spec(''R'') is also called the structure map.
*If ''E'' is a [[vector bundle]] over a topological space ''X'', then the projection map from ''E'' to ''X'' is the structure map.
*In [[topology]], a canonical map is a function ''f'' mapping a set ''X'' → ''X'' (''X'' [[Modulo operation|modulo]] ''R''), where ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]] in ''X'', that takes each ''x'' in ''X'' to the equivalence class ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[x]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' modulo ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq4UDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;pg=PA274|title=Handbook of Mathematics|last=Vialar|first=Thierry|date=2016-12-07|publisher=BoD - Books on Demand|isbn=9782955199008|language=en|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25339">In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Christoffel symbols''' are an array of numbers describing a [[metric connection]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{harv|Spivak|1999}} and {{harv|Choquet-Bruhat|DeWitt-Morette|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The metric connection is a specialization of the [[affine connection]] to [[surface (topology)|surface]]s or other [[manifold]]s endowed with a [[metric tensor|metric]], allowing distances to be measured on that surface.  In [[differential geometry]], an affine connection can be defined without any reference to a metric, and many additional concepts follow: [[parallel transport]], [[covariant derivative]]s, [[geodesic]]s, etc. also do not require the concept of a metric.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Adler, Maurice Bazin, Menahem Schiffer, ''Introduction to General Relativity'' (1965) McGraw-Hill Book Company {{ISBN|0-07-000423-4}} (''See section 2.1'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, John Archibald Wheeler, ''Gravitation'' (1973) W. H,. Freeman {{ISBN|0-7167-0334-3}} (''See chapters 8-11'')&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a metric is available, these concepts can be directly tied to the "shape" of the manifold itself; that shape is determined by how the [[tangent space]] is attached to the [[cotangent space]] by the [[metric tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, ''op. cit.'' (''See chapter 13'')&lt;/ref&gt; Abstractly, one would say that the manifold has an associated ([[orthonormal]]) [[frame bundle]], with each "[[vierbein|frame]]" being a possible choice of a [[coordinate frame]]. An invariant metric implies that the [[structure group]] of the frame bundle is the [[orthogonal group]] {{math|SO(''m'',''n'')}}. As a result, such a manifold is necessarily a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]].&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Jost, ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', (2002) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|3-540-42627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bleeker, ''Gauge Theory and Variational Principles'' (1991) Addison-Wesely Publishing Company {{ISBN|0-201-10096-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christoffel symbols provide a concrete representation of the connection of (pseudo-)[[Riemannian geometry]] in terms of coordinates on the manifold. Additional concepts, such as parallel transport, geodesics, etc. can then be expressed in terms of Christoffel symbols.

In general, there are an infinite number of metric connections for a given [[metric tensor]]; however, there is one, unique connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], that is free of any [[torsion tensor|torsion]]. It is very common in physics and [[general relativity]] to work almost exclusively with the Levi-Civita connection, by working in [[coordinate frame]]s (called [[Holonomic basis|holonomic coordinates]]) where the torsion vanishes. For example, in [[Euclidean spaces]], the Christoffel symbols describe how the [[Curvilinear_coordinates#Covariant_and_contravariant_bases| local coordinate bases]] change from point to point.

At each point of the underlying {{math|''n''}}-dimensional manifold, for any local coordinate system around that point, the Christoffel symbols are denoted {{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''i'', ''j'', ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}}. Each entry of this {{math|''n'' × ''n'' × ''n''}} [[Matrix (mathematics)|array]] is a [[real number]]. Under ''linear'' [[coordinate transformations]] on the manifold, the Christoffel symbols transform like the components of a [[tensor]], but under general coordinate transformations ([[diffeomorphism]]s) they do not.  Most of the algebraic properties of the Christoffel symbols follow from their relationship to the affine connection; only a few follow from the fact that the [[structure group]] is the orthogonal group {{math|SO(''m'',''n'')}} (or the [[Lorentz group]] {{math|SO(3,1)}} for general relativity).

Christoffel symbols are used for performing practical calculations. For example, the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] can be expressed entirely in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their first [[partial derivative]]s. In [[general relativity]], the connection plays the role of the gravitational force field with the corresponding gravitational potential being the metric tensor. When the coordinate system and the metric tensor share some symmetry, many of the {{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''jk''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[0 (number)|zero]].

The Christoffel symbols are named for [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]] (1829–1900).&lt;ref name="christoffel" &gt;{{citation|title=Ueber die Transformation der homogenen Differentialausdrücke zweiten Grades|last=Christoffel|first=E.B.|author-link=Elwin Bruno Christoffel|journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|volume=70|pages=46–70|year=1869|url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002153882&amp;IDDOC=266356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note&lt;!--'Connection coefficient' and 'Connection coefficients' and redirect here--&gt;==
The definitions given below are valid for both [[Riemannian manifold]]s and [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s, such as those of [[general relativity]], with careful distinction being made between upper and lower indices ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contra-variant and co-variant]] indices). The formulas hold for either [[sign convention]], unless otherwise noted.

[[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used in this article, with vectors indicated by bold font. The '''connection coefficients'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] (or pseudo-Riemannian connection) expressed in a coordinate basis are called ''Christoffel symbols''.

==Preliminary definitions==
Given a [[coordinate system]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}} on an {{math|''n''}}-manifold {{math|''M''}}, the [[tangent space|tangent vectors]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i = \frac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial x^i}=\partial_i \mathbf{x}, \quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''x'''}} is the position vector, define what is referred to as the local [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of the tangent space to {{math|''M''}} at each point of its domain. These can be used to define the [[metric tensor]]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

and its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}=\left( g_{ij} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which can in turn be used to define the dual basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i = \mathbf{e}_j g^{ji}, \quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition in Euclidean space==
In [[Euclidean space]], the general definition given below for the Christoffel symbols of the second kind can be proven to be equivalent to:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k{}_{ij}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}^{k}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot g^{km} \mathbf{e}_{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Christoffel symbols of the first kind can then be found via [[Ricci_calculus#Raising_and_lowering_indices|index juggling]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kij}
=   \Gamma^m_{ij}g_{mk}
=  \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}^{m} g_{mk}
    = \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{k} .
&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging, we see that:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}_{i}}{\partial x^j}=\Gamma^k{}_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{k} =\Gamma{}_{kij} \mathbf{e}^{k} &lt;/math&gt;

In words, the arrays represented by the Christoffel symbols track how the basis changes from point to point. Symbols of the second kind decompose the change with respect to the basis, while symbols of the first kind decompose it with respect to the dual basis. These expressions fail as definitions when such decompositions are not possible - in particular, when the direction of change does not lie in the tangent space, which can occur on a [[curvature | curved]] surface. In this form, it easy to see the symmetry of the lower or last two indices:

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k{}_{ij}=\Gamma^k{}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{kij}=\Gamma_{kji} &lt;/math&gt;,

from the definition of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt; and the fact that partial derivatives commute (as long as the manifold and coordinate system [[Symmetry_of_second_derivatives| are well behaved]]).

The same numerical values for Christoffel symbols of the second kind also relate to derivatives of the dual basis, as seen in the expression:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}^{i}}{\partial x^j}=- \Gamma^i_{jk} \mathbf{e}^{k} &lt;/math&gt;,

which we can rearrange as:

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^i_{jk} =- \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}^{i}}{\partial x^j}  \cdot \mathbf{e}_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== General definition==
===Christoffel symbols of the first kind===
The Christoffel symbols of the first kind can be derived either from the Christoffel symbols of the second kind and the metric,&lt;ref name="ludvigsen"&gt;{{citation |last1=Ludvigsen |first1=Malcolm|title=General Relativity: A Geometrical Approach | year=1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab} = g_{cd} \Gamma^{d}{}_{ab}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
or from the metric alone,&lt;ref name="ludvigsen" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab}
=\tfrac12 \left(\frac{\partial g_{ca}}{\partial x^b} + \frac{\partial g_{cb}}{\partial x^a} - \frac{\partial g_{ab}}{\partial x^c} \right)
= \tfrac12\, (g_{ca, b} + g_{cb, a} - g_{ab, c}) 
= \tfrac12\, \left(\partial_{b}g_{ca} + \partial_{a}g_{cb} - \partial_{c}g_{ab}\right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

As an alternative notation one also finds&lt;ref name="christoffel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjeep114"&gt;{{cite book

 |first1=D.J. |last1=Struik

 |edition=first published in 1988 Dover
 |year=1961
 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{cab} = [ab, c].&lt;/math&gt;
It is worth noting that {{math|[''ab'', ''c''] {{=}} [''ba'', ''c'']}}.&lt;ref name="bishopgoldberg" &gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds| year=1968|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christoffel symbols of the second kind (symmetric definition)===
The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are the connection coefficients—in a coordinate basis—of the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and since this connection has zero [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], then in this basis the connection coefficients are symmetric, i.e., {{math|Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}} {{=}} Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ji''}}}}.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"&gt;{{cite book
 |first1=U. |last1=Chatterjee
 |first2=N. |last2= Chatterjee
 |title=Vector &amp; Tensor Analysis
 |year=2010
 |page=480
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a torsion-free connection is often called ''symmetric''.

In other words, the Christoffel symbols of the second kind&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind" /&gt;
{{math|Γ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (sometimes {{math|Γ{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}}}} or {{math|&lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''k''|b=''ij''}}&lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;}})&lt;ref name="christoffel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatterjee"/&gt; are defined as the unique coefficients such that the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \mathrm{e}_j = \Gamma^k{}_{ij}\mathrm{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;
holds, where {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on {{math|''M''}} taken in the coordinate direction {{math|e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (i.e., {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ∇&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and where {{math|e&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a local coordinate ([[holonomic basis|holonomic]]) [[basis of a vector space|basis]].

The Christoffel symbols can be derived from the vanishing of the [[covariant derivative]] of the [[metric tensor]] {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
  0 = \nabla_l g_{ik}
    = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^l} - g_{mk}\Gamma^m{}_{il} - g_{im}\Gamma^m{}_{kl}
    = \frac{\partial g_{ik}}{\partial x^l} - 2g_{m(k}\Gamma^m{}_{i)l}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As a shorthand notation, the [[nabla symbol]] and the partial derivative symbols are frequently dropped, and instead a [[semicolon]] and a [[comma]] are used to set off the index that is being used for the derivative.  Thus, the above is sometimes written as
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \,g_{ik;l} = g_{ik,l} - g_{mk} \Gamma^m{}_{il} - g_{im} \Gamma^m{}_{kl} .&lt;/math&gt;

Using that the symbols are symmetric in the lower two indices, one can solve explicitly for the Christoffel symbols as a function of the metric tensor by permuting the indices and resumming:&lt;ref name="bishopgoldberg" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12g^{im} \left(\frac{\partial g_{mk}}{\partial x^l} + \frac{\partial g_{ml}}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial g_{kl}}{\partial x^m} \right) = \tfrac12g^{im} (g_{mk,l} + g_{ml,k} - g_{kl,m}),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|(''g&lt;sup&gt;jk&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} is the inverse of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{math|(''g&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, defined as (using the [[Kronecker delta]], and [[Einstein notation]] for summation) {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ji&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Although the Christoffel symbols are written in the same notation as [[Classical treatment of tensors|tensors with index notation]], they are '''not''' [[tensor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  {{harv|Kreyszig|1991}}, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;
since they [[#Change of variable|do not transform like tensors under a change of coordinates]].

===Connection coefficients in a nonholonomic basis===
The Christoffel symbols are most typically defined in a coordinate basis, which is the convention followed here. In other words,  the name '''Christoffel symbols''' is reserved only for coordinate (i.e., [[holonomic basis|holonomic]]) frames. However, the connection coefficients can also be defined in an arbitrary (i.e., nonholonomic) basis of tangent vectors {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf{u}_i}\mathbf{u}_j = \omega^k{}_{ij}\mathbf{u}_k.&lt;/math&gt;
Explicitly, in terms of the metric tensor, this is&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind"&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChristoffelSymboloftheSecondKind.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12g^{im} \left( g_{mk,l} + g_{ml,k} - g_{kl,m} + c_{mkl}+c_{ml k} - c_{kl m} \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;klm&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''g&lt;sub&gt;mp&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;kl&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are the [[Commutator (ring theory)|commutation coefficients]] of the basis; that is,
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{u}_k,\mathbf{u}_l] = c_{kl}{}^m \mathbf{u}_m&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the basis [[vector space|vector]]s and {{math|[ , ]}} is the [[Lie derivative|Lie bracket]]. The standard unit vectors in [[vector fields in cylindrical and spherical coordinates|spherical and cylindrical coordinates]] furnish an example of a basis with non-vanishing commutation coefficients. The difference between the connection in such a frame, and the Levi-Civita connection is known as the [[contorsion tensor]].

===Ricci rotation coefficients (asymmetric definition)===
When we choose the basis {{math|'''X'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} orthonormal: {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''η&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ⟨''X&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''X&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''⟩}} then {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;mk,l&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ ''η&lt;sub&gt;mk,l&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}. This implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^i{}_{kl}=\tfrac12\eta^{im} \left( c_{mkl}+c_{ml k} - c_{kl m} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the connection coefficients become antisymmetric in the first two indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc} = - \omega_{bac}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{abc} = \eta_{ad}\omega^d{}_{bc}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the connection coefficients {{math|''ω&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;bc&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are called the '''Ricci rotation coefficients'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dei sistemi di congruenze ortogonali in una varietà qualunque|author=G. Ricci-Curbastro|journal=Mem. Acc. Lincei |volume=2|year=1896|pages=276–322|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ricci's coefficients of rotation|author=H. Levy|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. |volume=31|year=1925|pages=142–145|issue=3-4|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid.bams/1183486405|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1925-03996-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalently, one can define Ricci rotation coefficients as follows:&lt;ref name="wolfram2ndkind" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^k{}_{ij} := {{\mathbf{u}}}^k \cdot \left( \nabla_j {{\mathbf{u}}}_i \right)\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an orthonormal nonholonomic basis and {{math|'''u'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''η&lt;sup&gt;kl&lt;/sup&gt;'''''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt;}} its ''co-basis''.

==Relationship to index-free notation==
Let {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''Y''}} be [[vector fields]] with components {{math|''X&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and {{math|''Y&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. Then the {{math|''k''}}th component of the covariant derivative of {{math|''Y''}} with respect to {{math|''X''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla_X Y\right)^k = X^i (\nabla_i Y)^k = X^i \left(\frac{\partial Y^k}{\partial x^i} + \Gamma^k{}_{im} Y^m\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the [[Einstein notation]] is used, so repeated indices indicate summation over indices and contraction with the metric tensor serves to raise and lower indices:
:&lt;math&gt;g(X,Y) = X^i Y_i = g_{ik}X^i Y^k = g^{ik}X_i Y_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Keep in mind that {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} and that {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the [[Kronecker delta]]. The convention is that the metric tensor is the one with the lower indices; the correct way to obtain {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} from {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is to solve the linear equations {{math|''g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''δ&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The statement that the connection is [[torsion tensor|torsion]]-free, namely that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X,Y]&lt;/math&gt;
is equivalent to the statement that—in a coordinate basis—the Christoffel symbol is symmetric in the lower two indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{jk}=\Gamma^i{}_{kj}.&lt;/math&gt;

The index-less transformation properties of a tensor are given by [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullbacks]] for covariant indices, and [[pushforward (differential)|pushforwards]] for contravariant indices. The article on [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|covariant derivatives]] provides additional discussion of the correspondence between index-free notation and indexed notation.

==Covariant derivatives of tensors==
The [[covariant derivative]] of a vector field {{math|''V&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l V^m = \frac{\partial V^m}{\partial x^l} + \Gamma^m{}_{kl} V^k.&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant derivative of a scalar field {{math|''φ''}} is just
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \varphi = \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;

and the covariant derivative of a [[covector]] field {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l \omega_m = \frac{\partial \omega_m}{\partial x^l} - \Gamma^k{}_{m l} \omega_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetry of the Christoffel symbol now implies
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i\nabla_j \varphi = \nabla_j\nabla_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

for any scalar field, but in general the covariant derivatives of higher order tensor fields do not commute (see [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]]).

The covariant derivative of a type (2,0) [[tensor]] field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;ik&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_l A^{ik}=\frac{\partial A^{ik}}{\partial x^l} + \Gamma^i{}_{ml} A^{mk} + \Gamma^k{}_{ml} A^{im}, &lt;/math&gt;

that is,
:&lt;math&gt; A^{ik} {}_{;l} = A^{ik} {}_{,l} + A^{mk} \Gamma^i{}_{ml} + A^{im} \Gamma^k{}_{ml}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the tensor field is [[mixed tensor|mixed]] then its covariant derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; A^i {}_{k;l} = A^i {}_{k,l} + A^{m} {}_k \Gamma^i{}_{ml} - A^i {}_m \Gamma^m{}_{kl}, &lt;/math&gt;

and if the tensor field is of type {{math|(0,2)}} then its covariant derivative is
:&lt;math&gt; A_{ik;l} = A_{ik,l} - A_{mk} \Gamma^m{}_{il} - A_{im} \Gamma^m{}_{kl}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Contravariant derivatives of tensors===
To find the contravariant derivative of a vector field, we must first transform 
it into a covariant derivative using the metric tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^l V^m = g^{il} \nabla_i V^m= g^{il} \partial_i V^m + g^{il} \Gamma^m_{ki} V^k=\partial^l V^m + g^{il} \Gamma^m_{ki} V^k&lt;/math&gt;

==Change of variable==
Under a change of variable from {{math|(''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''y&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} to {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'')}}, vectors transform as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} = \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}&lt;/math&gt;

and so
:&lt;math&gt;{\bar\Gamma}^k{}_{ij} =
\frac{\partial x^p}{\partial y^i}\,
\frac{\partial x^q}{\partial y^j}\,
\Gamma^r{}_{pq}\,
\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^r}
+ 
\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^m}\, 
\frac{\partial^2 x^m}{\partial y^i \partial y^j}  
&lt;/math&gt;

where the overline denotes the Christoffel symbols in the {{math|''y''}} coordinate system.  Note that the Christoffel symbol does '''not''' transform as a tensor, but rather as an object in the [[jet bundle]]. More precisely, the Christoffel symbols can be considered as functions on the jet bundle of the frame bundle of {{math|''M''}}, independent of any local coordinate system. Choosing a local coordinate system determines a local section of this bundle, which can then be used to pull back the Christoffel symbols to functions on {{math|''M''}}, though of course these functions then depend on the choice of local coordinate system.

At each point, there exist coordinate systems in which the Christoffel symbols vanish at the point.&lt;ref&gt;This is assuming that the connection is symmetric (e.g., the Levi-Civita connection).  If the connection has [[torsion tensor|torsion]], then only the symmetric part of the Christoffel symbol can be made to vanish.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are called (geodesic) [[normal coordinates]], and are often used in [[Riemannian geometry]].

==Applications to general relativity==
The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], where [[spacetime]] is represented by a curved 4-dimensional [[Lorentz manifold]] with a [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Einstein field equations]]—which determine the geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter—contain the [[Ricci tensor]], and so calculating the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by solving the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic equations]] in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.

[[William Rowan Hamilton]] invented [[quaternion]]s, a mathematical entity in 1843. This article describes Hamilton's original treatment of quaternions, using his notation and terms. Hamilton's treatment is more [[geometry|geometric]] than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions' [[algebra]]ic properties. Mathematically, quaternions discussed differ from the modern definition only by the terminology which is used.

==Classical elements of a quaternion==
Hamilton defined a quaternion as the [[quotient]] of two directed lines in tri[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] space;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg. 60|60}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more generally, as the quotient of two vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1881 pg. 32|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quaternion can be represented as the sum of a [[#Scalar|''scalar'']] and a [[#Vector|''vector'']]. It can also be represented as the product of its [[#Tensor|''tensor'']] and its [[#Versor|''versor'']].

===Scalar===
{{main|Scalar (mathematics)}}

Hamilton invented the term ''scalars'' for the [[real numbers]], because they span the "scale of progression from positive to negative infinity"&lt;ref&gt;
Hamilton, in the ''Philosophical magazine'', as cited in the ''OED''.&lt;/ref&gt; or because they represent the "comparison of positions upon one common scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter II Article 17|10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton regarded ordinary scalar algebra as the science of pure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853, pg 2 paragraph 3 of introduction.  Refers to his early article "Algebra as the Science of pure time".|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vector===
{{see also|Vector space}}
Hamilton defined a vector as "a right line ... having not only length but also direction".&lt;ref name=1866b1a1&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter I Article 1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton derived the word ''vector'' from the Latin [[wikt:vehere|''vehere'']], to carry.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1853) Lecture I Article 15, introduction of term vector, from vehere|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton conceived a vector as the "difference of its two extreme points."&lt;ref name=1866b1a1/&gt; For Hamilton, a vector was always a three-dimensional entity, having three co-ordinates relative to any given co-ordinate system, including but not limited to both [[Polar coordinate system|polar]] and [[rectangular]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1853) Lecture I Article 17 vector is natural triplet|1-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore referred to vectors as "triplets".

Hamilton defined addition of vectors in geometric terms, by placing the [[Euclidean vector#Representations|origin]] of the second vector at the end of the first.&lt;ref&gt;a{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter I Article 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to define vector subtraction.

By adding a vector to itself multiple times, he defined multiplication of a vector by an [[integer]], then extended this to division by an integer, and multiplication (and division) of a vector by a rational number. Finally, by taking limits, he defined the result of multiplying a vector α by any scalar ''x'' as a vector β with the same direction as α if ''x'' is positive; the opposite direction to α if ''x'' is negative; and a length that is |''x''| times the length of α.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter I Article 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[quotient]] of two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or anti-parallel vectors is therefore a scalar with absolute value equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two vectors; the scalar is positive if the vectors are parallel and negative if they are anti-parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter II Article 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unit vector====
A [[unit vector]] is a vector of length one.  Examples of unit vectors include i, j and k.

===Tensor===

: Note: The use of the word ''tensor'' by Hamilton does not coincide with modern terminology. Hamilton's ''tensor'' is actually the [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] on the quaternion algebra, which makes it a [[normed vector space]].
Hamilton defined ''tensor'' as a positive numerical quantity, or, more properly, signless number.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 57|1-PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1881 pg 5|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|CGZLAAAAMAAJ|Tait 1890 pg.31 explains Hamilton's older definition of a tensor as a positive number|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tensor can be thought of as a positive scalar.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1989 pg 165, refers to a tensor as a positive scalar.|165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "tensor" can be thought of as representing a "stretching factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Tait (1890), pg 32|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton introduced the term '''tensor''' in his first book, Lectures on Quaternions, based on lectures he gave shortly after his invention of the quaternions:
*''it seems convenient to enlarge by definition the signification of the new word tensor, so as to render it capable of including also those other cases in which we operate on a line by diminishing instead of increasing its length ; and generally by altering that length in any definite ratio. We shall thus (as was hinted at the end of the article in question) have fractional and even [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] tensors, which will simply be numerical multipliers, and will all be '''positive''' or (to speak more properly) '''SignLess Numbers''', that is, '''unclothed with the algebraic signs of positive and negative''' ; because, in the operation here considered, we abstract from the directions (as well as from the situations) of the lines which are compared or operated on.''

Each quaternion has a tensor, which is a measure of its magnitude (in the same way as the length of a vector is a measure of a vectors' magnitude). When a quaternion is defined as the quotient of two vectors, its tensor is the ratio of the lengths of these vectors.

===Versor===
{{main|versor}}
A versor is a quaternion with a tensor of 1. Alternatively, a versor can be defined as the quotient of two equal-length&lt;!-- non-zero? or Hamilton excluded zero vectors? --&gt; vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 section 8 pg 133 art 151 On the versor of a quaternion or a vector and some general formula of transformation|133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), art 156 pg 135, introduction of term versor|135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general a versor defines all of the following: a directional axis; the plane [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to that axis; and an angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), Section 8 article 151 pg 133|133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a versor and a vector which lies in the plane of the versor are multiplied, the result is a new vector of the same length but turned by the angle of the versor.

====Vector arc====
Since every unit vector can be thought of as a point on a [[unit sphere]], and since a versor can be thought of as the quotient of two vectors, a versor has a representative [[great circle]] arc, called a '''vector arc''', connecting these two points, drawn from the divisor or lower part of quotient, to the dividend or upper part of the quotient.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 section 9 art 162 pg 142 Vector Arcs considered as representative of versors of quaternions|142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Hardy (1881), art. 49 pg 71-72|71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right versor====
When the arc of a versor has the magnitude of a [[right angle]], then it is called a '''right versor''', a ''right radial'' or ''quadrantal versor''.

====Degenerate forms====
Two special degenerate versor cases, called the unit-scalars&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Hamilton Elements of Quaternions Article 147 pg 130|130}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two scalars, negative and positive unity can be thought of as '''scalar quaternions'''. These two scalars are special limiting cases, corresponding to versors with angles of either zero or π.

Unlike other versors, these two cannot be represented by a unique arc. The arc of one is a single point, and minus one can be represented by an infinite number of arcs, because there are an infinite number of shortest lines between antipodal points of a sphere.

===Quaternion===
Every quaternion can be decomposed into a scalar and a vector.

: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathbf{S}(q) + \mathbf{V}(q)&lt;/math&gt;

These two operations S and V are called "take the Scalar of" and "take the vector of" a quaternion. The vector part of a quaternion is also called the right part.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See Elements of Quaternions Section 13 starting on page 190|190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every quaternion is equal to a versor multiplied by the tensor of the quaternion. Denoting the versor of a quaternion by

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}q&lt;/math&gt;

and the tensor of a quaternion by

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q&lt;/math&gt;

we have

: &lt;math&gt;q=\mathbf{T}q\mathbf{U}q&lt;/math&gt;

====Right quaternion====
A right quaternion is a quaternion whose scalar component is zero,

: &lt;math&gt;S(q) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The angle of a right quaternion is 90 degrees.  A right quaternion can also be thought of as a vector plus a zero scalar. Right quaternions may be put in what was called the standard trinomial form. For example, if Q is a right quaternion, it may be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;Q = xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), Section 14 article 221 on page 233|233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four operations==
Four operations are of fundamental importance in quaternion notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 4|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: + − ÷ ×
In particular it is important to understand that there is a single operation of multiplication, a single operation of division, and a single operations of addition and subtraction. This single multiplication operator can operate on any of the types of mathematical entities. Likewise every kind of entity  can be divided, added or subtracted from any other type of entity. Understanding the meaning of the subtraction symbol is critical in quaternion theory, because it leads to an understanding of the concept of a vector.

===Ordinal operators===
The two ordinal operations in classical quaternion notation were addition and subtraction or + and −.

These marks are:

"...characteristics of synthesis and analysis of a state of progression, according as this state is considered as being derived from, or compared with, some other state of that progression."&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 art 5 pg 4 -5|1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtraction====

Subtraction is a type of [[analysis]] called [[ordinal analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton pg 33|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...let space be now regarded as the field of progression which is to be studied, and POINTS as ''states'' of that progression. ...I am led to regard the word "Minus," or the mark −, in geometry, as the sign or characteristic of analysis of one geometric position (in space), as compared with another (such) position. The comparison of one mathematical point with another with a view to the determination of what may be called their ordinal relation, or their relative position in space...&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 5-6|1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first example of subtraction is to take the point A to represent the earth, and the point B to represent the sun, then an arrow drawn from A to B represents the act of moving or vection&lt;!-- ??? --&gt; from A to B.

::B − A

this represents the first example in Hamilton's lectures of a vector.  In this case the act of traveling from the earth to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|see Hamilton 1853 pg 8-15|1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 15 introduction of the term vector as the difference between two points.|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Addition====
Addition is a type of analysis called ordinal synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg.19 Hamilton associates plus sign with ordinal synthesis|1-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Addition of vectors and scalars=====
Vectors and scalars can be added. When a vector is added to a scalar, a completely different entity, a quaternion is created.

A vector plus a scalar is always a quaternion even if the scalar is zero.  If the scalar added to the vector is zero then the new quaternion produced is called a right quaternion.  It has an angle characteristic of 90 degrees.

===Cardinal operations===
The two Cardinal operations&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1853), pg 35, Hamilton first introduces cardinal operations|1-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; in quaternion notation are geometric multiplication and geometric division and can be written:

: ÷, ×
It is not required to learn the following more advanced terms in order to use division and multiplication.

Division is a kind of [[analysis]] called cardinal analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1953 pg.36 Division defined as cardinal analysis|36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplication is a kind of synthesis called cardinal synthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 37|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Division====
Classically, the quaternion was viewed as the ratio of two vectors, sometimes called a geometric fraction.

If OA and OB represent two vectors drawn from the origin O to two other points A and B, then the geometric fraction was written as

: &lt;math&gt;OA:OB&lt;/math&gt;

Alternately if the two vectors are represented by α and β the quotient was written as

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha\div\beta&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton asserts: '''"The quotient of two vectors is generally a quaternion".'''&lt;ref&gt;{{
google  books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), Article 112 page 110|110}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lectures on Quaternions'' also first introduces the concept of a quaternion as the quotient of two vectors:

Logically and by definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 32|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures on Quaternions page 37|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=q&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;{q}\times{\beta} = \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;.

In Hamilton's calculus the product is not [[commutative]], i.e., the order of the variables is of great importance. If the order of q and β were to be reversed the result would not in general be α. The quaternion q can be thought of as an operator that changes β into α, by first rotating it, formerly an act of [[rotation (mathematics)|''version'']] and then changing the length of it, formerly call an act of [[homothetic transformation|''tension'']].

Also by definition the quotient of two vectors is equal to the [[numerator]] times the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[denominator]]. Since multiplication of vectors is not commutative, the order cannot be changed in the following expression.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\,{\alpha}\times\frac{1}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Again the order of the two quantities on the right hand side  is significant.

Hardy presents the definition of division in terms of mnemonic cancellation rules. "Canceling being performed by an upward right hand stroke".&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Elements of quaternions|46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If alpha and beta are vectors and q is a quaternion such that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = q &lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta^{-1}=q&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}.\beta = \alpha\beta^{-1}.\beta=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|CGZLAAAAMAAJ|Tait Treaties on Quaternions|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\div&lt;/math&gt; are inverse operations, such that:

: &lt;math&gt;\beta\div\alpha\times\alpha=\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q\times\alpha\div\alpha=q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures On Quaternions pg 38|38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma=(\gamma\div\beta)\times(\beta\div\alpha)\times\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures on quaternions page 41|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important way to think of q is as an operator that changes β into α, by first rotating it (''version'') and then changing its length (tension).

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma\div\alpha=(\gamma\div\beta)\times(\beta\div\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures on quaternions pg 42|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Division of the unit vectors ''i'', ''j'', ''k''====
The results of the using the division operator on i, j and k was as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ40|Hardy (1881), page 40-41|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ij = k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{j}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;jk = i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{i}{k}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ki = j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{j}{i}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ji = -k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-k}{i}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;kj = -i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-i}{j}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ik = -j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-j}{k}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;i(-j) = -k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-k}{-j}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;i(-k) = j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{j}{-k}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;k(-i) = -j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-j}{-i}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;k(-j) = i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{i}{-j}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;j(-k) =-i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-i}{-k}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;j(-i) = k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{-i}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The reciprocal of a unit vector is the vector reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1887 pg 45 formula 29|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{i} = i^{-1} = -i&lt;/math&gt;

Because a unit vector and its reciprocal are parallel to each other but point in opposite directions, the product of a unit vector and its reciprocal have a special case commutative property, for example if a is any unit vector then:&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1887 pg 45 formula 30|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}a = (-a)a = 1 = a(-a) = a\frac{1}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, in the more general case involving more than one vector (whether or not it is a unit vector) the commutative property does not hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1887 pg 46|46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

::&lt;math&gt;i\frac{k}{i}&lt;/math&gt; ≠ &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{i} i.&lt;/math&gt;

This is because k/i is carefully defined as:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{i} = k\frac{1}{i} = ki^{-1} = k(-i) = -(ki) = -(j) = -j&lt;/math&gt;.

So that:

::&lt;math&gt;i\frac{k}{i} = i(-j) = -k&lt;/math&gt;,

however

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{i} i= (-j)i = -(ji) = -(-k) = k&lt;/math&gt;

====Division of two parallel vectors====
While in general the quotient of two vectors is a quaternion, If α and β are two parallel vectors then the quotient of these two vectors is a scalar. For example, if

&lt;math&gt;\alpha = ai&lt;/math&gt;,

and &lt;math&gt;\beta = bi&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\div\beta = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{ai}{bi} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
Where a/b is a scalar.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Elements of Quaternions, book one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Division of two non-parallel vectors=====
The quotient of two vectors is in general the quaternion:

: &lt;math&gt;q =\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{T\alpha}{T\beta}(\cos\phi + \epsilon\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Where α and β are two non-parallel vectors, φ is that angle between them, and e is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the vectors α and β, with its direction given by the standard right hand rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 39 article 25|39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiplication====
Classical quaternion notation had only one concept of multiplication. Multiplication of two real numbers, two imaginary numbers or a real number by an imaginary number in the classical notation system was the same operation.

Multiplication of a scalar and a vector was accomplished with the same single multiplication operator; multiplication of two vectors of quaternions used this same operation as did multiplication of a quaternion and a vector or of two quaternions.

=====Factor, Faciend and Factum=====

::Factor × Faciend = Factum&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg. 27 explains Factor Faciend and Factum|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two quantities are multiplied the first quantity is called the factor,&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 section 103|104}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second quantity is called the faciend and the result is called the factum.

=====Distributive=====
In classical notation, multiplication was [[distributive property|distributive]]. Understanding this makes it simple to see why the product of two vectors in classical notation produced a quaternion.

: &lt;math&gt;q=(ai + bj + ck)\times(ei + fj + gk)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;q = ae({i}\times{i}) + af({i}\times{j}) + ag({i}\times{k}) + be({j}\times{i}) + bf({j}\times{j}) + bg({j}\times{k}) + ce({k}\times{i}) + cf({k}\times{j}) + cg({k}\times{k})&lt;/math&gt;

Using the quaternion multiplication table we have:

: &lt;math&gt;q = ae(-1) + af(+k) + ag(-j) + be(-k) + bf(-1) + bg(+i) + ce(+j) + cf(-i) + cg(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Then collecting terms:

: &lt;math&gt;q = -ae - bf - cg + (bg-cf)i + (ce - ag)j + (af-be)k&lt;/math&gt;

The first three terms are a scalar.

Letting

: &lt;math&gt;w = -ae - bf - cg&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;x = (bg-cf)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y = (ce - ag)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;z = (af-be)&lt;/math&gt;

So that the product of two vectors is a quaternion, and can be written in the form:

: &lt;math&gt;q = w + xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;

=====Product of two right quaternions=====
The product of two right quaternions is generally a quaternion.

Let α and β be the right quaternions that result from taking the vectors of two quaternions:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\mathbf{V}p&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;

Their product in general is a new quaternion represented here by r. This product is not ambiguous because classical notation has only one product.

:&lt;math&gt;r =\,\alpha\beta;&lt;/math&gt;

Like all quaternions r may now be decomposed into its vector and scalar parts.

:&lt;math&gt;r=\mathbf{S}r+\mathbf{V}r&lt;/math&gt;

google books|Hardy (1887) scalar of the product vector of the product defined, pg |57}}&lt;/ref&gt; of two right quaternions.
: Note: "Scalar of the product" corresponds to Euclidean [[scalar product]] of two vectors up to the change of sign (multiplication to −1).

==Other operators in detail==

===Scalar and vector===
Two important operations in two the classical quaternion notation system were '''S'''(q) and '''V'''(q) which meant take the scalar part of, and take the imaginary part, what Hamilton called the vector part of the quaternion. Here S and V are operators acting on q. Parenthesis can be omitted in these kinds of expressions without ambiguity. Classical notation:

: &lt;math&gt;q =\,\mathbf{S}q + \mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''q'' is a quaternion. '''''S'''q'' is the scalar of the quaternion while '''V'''q is the vector of the quaternion.

===Conjugate===
'''K''' is the conjugate operator. The conjugate of a quaternion is a quaternion obtained by multiplying the vector part of the first quaternion by minus one.

If

:&lt;math&gt;q =\,\mathbf{S}q + \mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}q=\mathbf{S}\,q - \mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;.

The expression

:&lt;math&gt;r=\,\mathbf{K}q&lt;/math&gt;,

means, assign the quaternion r the value of the conjugate of the quaternion q.

===Tensor===
'''T''' is the tensor operator. It returns a kind of number called a [[#Tensor|''tensor'']].

The tensor of a positive scalar is that scalar. The tensor of a negative scalar is the [[absolute value]] of the scalar (i.e., without the negative sign). For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(5) = 5 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(-5)= 5&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor of a vector is by definition the length of the vector. For example, if:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}\alpha = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor of a unit vector is one.  Since the versor of a vector is a unit vector, the tensor of the versor of any vector is always equal to unity. Symbolically:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{TU}\alpha = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 pg164 Tensor of the versor of a vector is unity.|164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quaternion is by definition the quotient of two vectors and the tensor of a quaternion is by definition the quotient of the tensors of these two vectors. In symbols:

: &lt;math&gt;q = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q = \frac{\mathbf{T}\alpha}{\mathbf{T}\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Elements of Quaternions, Ch. 11|162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this definition it can be shown that a useful [[Euclidean norm|formula for the tensor of a quaternion]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 65|65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q=\sqrt{w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be proven from this definition that another formula to obtain the tensor of a quaternion is from the common norm, defined as the product of a quaternion and its conjugate. The square root of the common norm of a quaternion is equal to its tensor.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q=\sqrt{qKq}&lt;/math&gt;

A useful identity is that the square of the tensor of a quaternion is equal to the tensor of the square of a quaternion, so that parenthesis may be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 pg 169 art 190 Tensor of the square is the square of the tensor|169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{T}q)^2 = \mathbf{T}(q^2) = \mathbf{T}q^2&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the tensors of conjugate quaternions are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 pg 167 art. 187 equation 12 Tensors of conjugate quaternions are equal|167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{TK}q = \mathbf{T}q&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor of a quaternion is now called its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]].

===Axis and angle===
Taking the angle of a non-scalar quaternion, resulted in a value greater than zero and less than π.&lt;ref&gt;{{
cite web|url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=math;cc=math;idno=05230001;node=05230001%3A4;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=304;page=root;size=S|title=Hamilton (1853), pg 164, art 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), pg 118|118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a non-scalar quaternion is viewed as the quotient of two vectors, then the axis of the quaternion is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors in this original quotient, in a direction specified by the right hand rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), pg 118|117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle is the angle between the two vectors.

In symbols,

: &lt;math&gt;u = Ax.q&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \angle q&lt;/math&gt;

===Reciprocal===

If

:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

then its [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] is defined as

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{q}=q^{-1} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression:

: &lt;math&gt;{q}\times{\alpha}\times\frac{1}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

Reciprocals have many important applications,&lt;ref&gt;
See Goldstein (1980) Chapter 7 for the same function written in matrix notation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
cite web|url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=math;cc=math;idno=05230001;q1=vector;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=408;page=root;size=S|title=Lorentz Transforms Hamilton (1853), pg 268 1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|rotations]], particularly when q is  a versor. A versor has an easy formula for its reciprocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 71|34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(\mathbf{U}q)}= \mathbf{S.U}q - \mathbf{V.U}q = \mathbf{K.U}q&lt;/math&gt;

In words the reciprocal of a versor is equal to its conjugate. The dots between operators show the order of the operations, and also help to indicate that S and U for example, are two different operations rather than a single operation named SU.

===Common norm===
The product of a quaternion with its conjugate is its common norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), pg 128 -129|128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of taking the common norm of a quaternion is represented with the letter '''N'''. By definition the common norm is the product of a quaternion with its conjugate. It can be proven&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See foot note at bottom of page, were word proven is highlighted.|129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google  books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See Hamilton 1898 pg. 169 art. 190 for proof of relationship between tensor and common norm|169}}&lt;/ref&gt; that common norm is equal to the square of the tensor of a quaternion. However this proof does not constitute a definition. Hamilton gives exact, independent definitions of both the common norm and the tensor. This norm was adopted as suggested from the theory of numbers, however to quote Hamilton "they will not often be wanted". The tensor is generally of greater utility. The word '''norm''' does not appear in ''Lectures on Quaternions'', and only twice in the table of contents of ''Elements of Quaternions''.

In symbols:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}q=\,q\mathbf{K}q =\,(\mathbf{T}q)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The common norm of a versor is always equal to positive unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1899 pg 138|138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{NU}q = \mathbf{U}q.\mathbf{KU}q = 1&lt;/math&gt;

==Biquaternions==

===Geometrically real and geometrically imaginary numbers===
In classical quaternion literature the equation

: &lt;math&gt;q^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;

was thought to have infinitely many solutions that were called '''geometrically real'''.
These solutions are the unit vectors that form the surface of a unit sphere.

A '''geometrically real''' quaternion is one that can be written as a linear combination of ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'', such that the squares of the [[coefficient]]s add up to one. Hamilton demonstrated that there had to be additional roots of this equation in addition to the geometrically real roots. Given the existence of the imaginary scalar, a number of expressions can be written and given proper names. All of these were part of Hamilton's original quaternion calculus. In symbols:

: &lt;math&gt;q + q'\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where q and q′ are real quaternions, and the square root of minus one is the [[imaginary unit|imaginary of ordinary algebra]], and are called an '''imaginary or symbolical roots'''&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See Elements of Quaternions Articles 256 and 257|275}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not a geometrically real vector quantity.

===Imaginary scalar===
'''Geometrically Imaginary''' quantities are additional roots of the above equation of a purely symbolic nature. In article 214 of ''Elements'' Hamilton proves that if there is an i, j and k there also has to be another quantity h which is an imaginary scalar, which he observes should have already occurred to anyone who had read the preceding articles with attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements article 214 infamous remark...as would already have occurred to anyone who had read the preceding articles with attention|218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 149 of ''Elements'' is about Geometrically Imaginary numbers and includes a footnote introducing the term ''biquaternion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Elements of Quaternions Article 149|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''imaginary of ordinary algebra'' and ''scalar imaginary'' are sometimes used for these geometrically imaginary quantities.

''Geometrically Imaginary'' roots to an equation were interpreted in classical thinking as geometrically impossible situations. Article 214 of elements of quaternions explores the example of the equation of a line and a circle that do not intersect, as being indicated by the equation having only a geometrically imaginary root.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See elements of quaternions article 214|217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamilton's later writings he proposed using the letter h to denote the imaginary scalar&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements of Quaternions pg 276 Example of h notation for imaginary scalar|276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements Article 274 pg 300 Example of use of h notation|300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements article 274 pg. 300 Example of h denoting imaginary of ordinary algebra|300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biquaternion===
{{main|Biquaternion}}
On page 665 of ''Elements of Quaternions'' Hamilton defines a biquaternion to be a quaternion with [[complex number]] coefficients. The scalar part of a biquaternion is then a complex number called a '''biscalar'''. The vector part of a biquaternion is a [[bivector (complex)|bivector]] consisting of three complex components. The biquaternions are then the [[complexification]] of the original (real) quaternions.

===Other double quaternions===
Hamilton invented the term ''associative'' to distinguish between the imaginary scalar (known by now as a [[complex number]]) which is both commutative and associative, and four other possible roots of negative unity which he designated L, M, N and O, mentioning them briefly in appendix B of ''Lectures on Quaternions'' and in private letters. However, non-associative roots of minus one do not appear in ''Elements of Quaternions''. Hamilton died before he worked{{clarify|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- the author is a medium, eh? --&gt; on these strange entities. His son claimed it to be a "bow for another Ulysses".&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Bow for another Ulysses is a famous remark made by Hamilton's son, in the preface of Elements 1866|117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tables list the [[computational complexity]] of various [[algorithm]]s for common [[mathematical operation]]s.

Here, complexity refers to the [[time complexity]] of performing computations on a [[multitape Turing machine]].&lt;ref name="Schonhage"&gt;A. Schönhage, A.F.W. Grotefeld, E. Vetter: ''Fast Algorithms—A Multitape Turing Machine Implementation'', BI Wissenschafts-Verlag, Mannheim, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; See [[big O notation]] for an explanation of the notation used.

Note: Due to the variety of multiplication algorithms, ''M''(''n'') below stands in for the complexity of the chosen multiplication algorithm.

==Special functions==
Many of the methods in this section are given in Borwein &amp; Borwein.&lt;ref&gt;J. Borwein &amp; P. Borwein. ''Pi and the AGM: A Study in Analytic Number Theory and Computational Complexity''. John Wiley 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elementary functions===
The [[elementary function]]s are constructed by composing arithmetic operations, the [[exponential function]] (exp), the [[natural logarithm]] (log), [[trigonometric function]]s (sin, cos), and their inverses. The complexity of an elementary function is equivalent to that of its inverse, since all elementary functions are [[analytic function|analytic]] and hence invertible by means of Newton's method. In particular, if either exp or log in the complex domain can be computed with some complexity, then that complexity is attainable for all other elementary functions.

Below, the size ''n'' refers to the number of digits of precision at which the function is to be evaluated.

In 2005, [[Henry Cohn]], [[Robert Kleinberg]], [[Balázs Szegedy]], and [[Chris Umans]] showed that either of two different conjectures would imply that the exponent of matrix multiplication is 2.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cohn, Robert Kleinberg, Balazs Szegedy, and Chris Umans.

{{note|blockinversion|{{big|*}}}}Because of the possibility of [[Invertible matrix#Blockwise inversion|blockwise inverting a matrix]], where an inversion of an {{math|{{var|n}}×{{var|n}}}} matrix requires inversion of two half-sized matrices and six multiplications between two half-sized matrices, and since matrix multiplication has a lower bound of {{math|[[Big O notation#Family of Bachmann–Landau notations|Ω]]({{var|n}}{{sup|2}} log {{var|n}})}} operations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ran Raz]].

ACM Press, 2002. {{doi|10.1145/509907.509932}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it can be shown that a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that uses blockwise inversion to invert a matrix runs with the same time complexity as the matrix multiplication algorithm that is used internally.&lt;ref&gt;T.H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">A '''correlation coefficient''' is a [[numerical measure]] of some type of [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]], meaning a statistical relationship between two [[variable (mathematics)|variables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorC |title=correlation coefficient |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=NCME.org |publisher=[[National Council on Measurement in Education]] |access-date=April 17, 2014 |quote=correlation coefficient: A statistic used to show how the scores from one measure relate to scores on a second measure for the same group of individuals. A high value (approaching +1.00) is a strong direct relationship, values near 0.50 are considered moderate and values below 0.30 are considered to show weak relationship.  A low negative value (approaching -1.00) is similarly a strong inverse relationship, and values near 0.00 indicate little, if any, relationship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variables may be two [[column (database)|column]]s of a given [[data set]] of observations, often called a [[sample (statistics)|sample]], or two components of a [[multivariate random variable]] with a known [[distribution (statistics)|distribution]].

Several types of correlation coefficient exist, each with their own definition and own range of usability and characteristics. They all assume values in the range from −1 to +1, where +1 indicates the strongest possible agreement and −1 the strongest possible disagreement. As tools of analysis, correlation coefficients present certain problems, including the propensity of some types to be distorted by [[outliers]] and the possibility of incorrectly being used to infer a [[causal relationship]] between the variables.&lt;ref name="Boddy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boddy|first1=Richard |last2=Smith|first2=Gordon |title=Statistical methods in practice: for scientists and technologists |date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-74664-6|pages=95-96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
=== Pearson ===

The [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]], also known as ''r'', ''R'', or Pearson's ''r'', is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables that is defined as the [[covariance]] of the variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. This is the best known and most commonly used type of correlation coefficient; when the term "correlation coefficient" is used without further qualification, it usually refers to the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient

=== Intra-class ===

[[Intraclass correlation]] (ICC) is a descriptive statistic that can be used when quantitative measurements are made on units that are organized into groups; it describes how strongly units in the same group resemble each other.

=== Rank ===

[[Rank correlation]] is a measure of the relationship between the rankings of two variables or two rankings of the same variable:
*[[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]] is a measure of how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonic function.
*The [[Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient]] is a measure of the portion of ranks that match between two data sets.
*[[Goodman and Kruskal's gamma]] is a measure of the strength of association of the cross tabulated data when both variables are measured at the ordinal level.

==See also==
*[[Distance correlation]]
*[[Goodness of fit]], any of several measures that measure how well a statistical model fits observations by summarizing the discrepancy between observed values and the values expected under the model

'''''De divina proportione''''' (''On the Divine Proportion'') is a book on [[mathematics]] written by [[Luca Pacioli]] and illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], composed around 1498 in [[Milan]] and first printed in 1509.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; Its subject was mathematical proportions (the title refers to the [[golden ratio]]) and their applications to geometry, visual art through [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and architecture. The clarity of the written material and Leonardo's excellent diagrams helped the book to achieve an impact beyond mathematical circles, popularizing contemporary geometric concepts and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html|title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra|first=George W.|last=Hart|website=Virtual Polyhedra|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~hoek/Teaching/Golden/Divina.html|publisher = [[University of British Columbia]]|title = The Rose and the Nautilus|last = Hoechsmann|first = Klaus Hoechsmann|date = 1 April 2001|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the book==
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:Divina proportione.png|thumb|250px| Woodcut illustrating proportions of the human face. Note that despite the label in the image, the lines drawn relate to Vitruvius' system of integers and do not correspond in any way to the golden ratio.]]
The book consists of three separate manuscripts,&lt;ref name="StAnd"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Pacioli.html|title = Luca Pacioli|website = School of Mathematics and Statistics|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]|last = O'Connor|first = J J|last2 = Robertson|first2 = E F|date = July 1999|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Pacioli worked on between 1496 and 1498.

===''Compendio divina proportione''===
The first part, ''Compendio divina proportione'' (''Compendium on the Divine Proportion''), studies the [[golden ratio]] from a mathematical perspective (following the relevant work of [[Euclid]]) and explores its applications to various arts, in seventy-one chapters.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; It also contains a discourse on the [[Regular polyhedra|regular]] and [[semiregular polyhedra]],&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J F|last=Field|title=Rediscovering the Archimedean polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler|journal=Arch. Hist. Exact Sci.|volume=50|number=3-4|year=1997|pages=241–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a discussion of the use of [[geometric perspective]] by painters such as [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Melozzo da Forlì]] and [[Marco Palmezzano]].

===''Trattato dell'architettura''===
The second part, ''Trattato dell'architettura'' (''Treatise on Architecture''), discusses the ideas of [[Vitruvius]] (from his ''[[De architectura]]'') on the application of [[mathematics and architecture|mathematics to architecture]] in twenty chapters. The text compares the proportions of the human body to those of artificial structures, with examples from classical [[Greco-Roman world#Architecture|Greco-Roman architecture]].

===''Libellus in tres partiales divisus''===
The third part, ''Libellus in tres partiales divisus'' (''Book divided into three parts''), is mainly an Italian translation of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s Latin writings ''On [the] Five Regular Solids'' ("''De quinque corporibus regularibus''")&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; and mathematical examples.&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b@lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |title=La Divine Proportion de Luca Pacioli |language=French |publisher=Académie de Poitiers |last=Gardes |first=Michel |date=20 June 2001 |accessdate=15 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127090823/http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b%40lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |archivedate=27 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1550 [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote a biography of della Francesca, in which he accused Pacioli of plagiarism and claimed that he stole della Francesca's work on perspective, on arithmetic and on geometry.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt;

===Illustrations===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|250px| The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]
After these three parts are appended two sections of illustrations, the first showing twenty-three capital letters drawn with a ruler and compass by Pacioli and the second with some sixty illustrations in [[woodcut]] after drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/drawings_and_prints/divina_proportione_leonardo_da_vinci/objectview.aspx?collID=9&amp;OID=90003660|website = The Collection Online|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Divina proportione, after Leonardo da Vinci|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo drew the illustrations of the regular solids while he lived with and took mathematics lessons from Pacioli. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids which allowed an easy distinction between front and back.

==History==
Pacioli produced three manuscripts of the treatise by different scribes. He gave the first copy with a dedication to the Duke of Milan, [[Ludovico il Moro]]; this manuscript is now preserved in Switzerland at the [[Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire (Geneva)|Bibliothèque de Genève]] in [[Geneva]]. A second copy was donated to [[Galeazzo da Sanseverino]] and now rests at the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan. The third, which has gone missing, was given to [[Pier Soderini]], the [[Gonfaloniere of Justice|Gonfaloniere]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PACIOLI, Luca|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Di Teodoro|first=Francesco Paolo|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1509 the first printed edition was published in Venice by [[Paganino Paganini]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since been reprinted several times.

The book was displayed as part of an exhibition in Milan between October 2005 and October 2006 together with the [[Codex Atlanticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/atlantico/manoscritti_eng.htm|title = The Virtual Codex Atlanticus|website = Leonardo3|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "M" logo used by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York is adapted from one in ''De divina proportione''.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://store.metmuseum.org/magnets-bookmarks+novelties/renaissance-m-bookmark/invt/10086668/|website = The Met Store|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Renaissance 'M' Bookmark|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">An '''entitative graph''' is an element of the [[diagram]]matic [[syntax]]  for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of '''qualitative logic''' beginning in the 1880s, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned.  See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.

The [[syntax]] is:
*The blank page;
*Single letters, phrases;
*Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
*The blank page denotes '''False''';
*Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be '''True''' or '''False''';
*To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes '''Truth''';
*All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

Peirce soon abandoned the entitative graphs for the [[existential graph]]s, whose sentential (''alpha'') part is [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] to the entitative graphs. He developed the existential graphs until they became another formalism for what are now termed [[first-order logic]] and [[normal modal logic]].

The [[Laws of form|primary algebra]] of [[G. Spencer-Brown]] is isomorphic to the entitative graphs.

The '''Anna and Lajos Erdős Prize in Mathematics''' is a prize given by the [[Israel Mathematical Union]] to an [[Israel]]i [[mathematician]] (in any field of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]), "with preference to candidates up to the age of 40."  The prize was established by [[Paul Erdős]] in 1977 in honor of his parents, and is awarded annually or biannually.  The name was changed from "Erdős Prize" in 1996, after Erdős's death, to reflect his original wishes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24361">[[File:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|286x286px|The [[Platonic solid]]s, seen here in an illustration from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (1596), are an early example of exceptional objects. The symmetries of three-dimensional space can be classified into two infinite families—the [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] and [[Dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetries of ''n''-sided polygons—and five exceptional types of symmetry, namely the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids.]]
Many branches of mathematics study objects of a given type and prove a [[classification theorem]]. A common theme is that the classification results in a number of series of objects and a finite number of exceptions that do not fit into any series. These are known as '''exceptional objects'''. Frequently these exceptional objects play a further and important role in the subject. Furthermore, the exceptional objects in one branch of mathematics are often related to the exceptional objects in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stillwell|first=John|date=1998|title=Exceptional Objects|jstor=2589218|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=105|issue=9|pages=850–858|doi=10.2307/2589218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1505.06742|first=Yang-Hui|last=He|first2=John|last2=McKay|author-link2=John McKay (mathematician)|title=Sporadic and Exceptional|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue33/features/baez/index|title=Ubiquitous octonions|last=Joyce|first=Helen|date=1 January 2005|website=Plus Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related phenomenon is [[exceptional isomorphism]], when two series are in general different, but agree for some small values.

== Regular polytopes ==
{{Main|Regular polytope}}
The prototypical examples of exceptional objects arise in the classification of [[regular polytope]]s. In two dimensions there is a series of [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gons]] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3. In every dimension above 2 we find analogues of the cube, tetrahedron and octahedron. In three dimensions we find two more regular polyhedra — the [[dodecahedron]] (12-hedron) and the [[icosahedron]] (20-hedron) — making five [[Platonic solids]]. In four dimensions we have a total of six [[Convex regular 4-polytope|regular polytopes]] including the [[120-cell]], the [[600-cell]] and the [[24-cell]]. There are no other regular polytopes; in higher dimensions the only regular polytopes are of the [[hypercube]], [[simplex]], [[orthoplex]] series.  In all dimensions combined, there are therefore three series and five exceptional polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/platonic.html|title=Platonic Solids in All Dimensions|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=12 November 2006|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern is similar if non-convex polytopes are included.  In two dimensions there is a [[regular star polygon]] for every [[rational number]] ''p''/''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.  In three dimensions there are four [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]], and in four dimensions ten [[Schläfli–Hess polychoron|Schläfli–Hess polychora]]; in higher dimensions there are no non-convex regular figures.

These can be generalized to [[tessellation]]s of other spaces, especially [[Uniform tiling|uniform tessellations]], notably tilings of Euclidean space ([[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]), which have exceptional objects, and tilings of hyperbolic space. There are various exceptional objects in dimension below 6, but in dimension 6 and above the only regular polyhedra/tilings/hyperbolic tilings are the simplex, hypercube, cross-polytope, and hypercube lattice.

=== Schwarz triangles ===
{{further|Schwarz triangle}}
{| class="wikitable" align=right

|}

Related to tilings and the regular polyhedra, there are exceptional [[Schwarz triangle]]s (triangles that tile the sphere, or more generally Euclidean plane or hyperbolic plane via their [[triangle group]] of reflections in their edges), particularly the [[Möbius triangle]]s. In the sphere there are 3 Möbius triangles (and 1 1-parameter family), corresponding to the 3 exceptional Platonic solid groups, while in the Euclidean plane there are 3 Möbius triangles, corresponding to the 3 special triangles: 60-60-60 ([[equilateral triangle|equilateral]]), [[45-45-90]] (isosceles right), and [[30-60-90]]. There are additional exceptional Schwarz triangles in the sphere and Euclidean plane. By contrast, in the hyperbolic plane there is a 3-parameter family of Möbius triangles, and none exceptional.

== Finite simple groups ==
{{Main|Sporadic group}}
[[File:SporadicGroups.svg|thumb|The relations between the sporadic groups, most being related to the monster.]]

The finite simple groups have been [[Classification of finite simple groups|classified]] into a number of series as well as 26 [[sporadic groups]]. Of these, 20 are subgroups or subquotients of the [[monster group]], referred to as the "Happy Family", while 6 are not, and are referred to as "[[Pariah group|pariahs]]".

Several of the sporadic groups are related to the [[Leech lattice]], most notably the Conway group Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, quotiented out by its center.

== Division algebras ==

There are only three finite-dimensional associative [[division algebras]] over the reals — the [[real numbers]], the [[complex numbers]] and the [[quaternions]]. The only non-associative division algebra is the algebra of [[octonions]]. The octonions are connected to a wide variety of exceptional objects. For example, the exceptional formally real [[Jordan algebra]] is the [[Albert algebra]] of 3 by 3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions.

== Simple Lie groups ==

The [[simple Lie group]]s form a number of series ([[classical Lie group]]s) labelled A, B, C and D. In addition there are the exceptional groups [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (the automorphism group of the octonions), [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. These last four groups can be viewed as the symmetry groups of projective planes over '''O''', '''C'''⊗'''O''', '''H'''⊗'''O''' and '''O'''⊗'''O''' respectively, where '''O''' is the octonions and the tensor products are over the reals.

The classification of Lie groups corresponds to the classification of [[root systems]] and thus the exceptional Lie groups correspond to exceptional root systems and exceptional [[Dynkin diagram]]s.

== Supersymmetric algebras ==
There are a few exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. The classification of [[superalgebra]]s by [[Victor Kac|Kac]] and Tierry-Mieg indicates that the [[Lie superalgebra]]s '''G(3)''' in 31 dimensions and '''F(4)''' in 40 dimensions, and the Jordan superalgebras '''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''K&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''', are examples of exceptional objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V. G.|date=1977-01-01|title=Classification of simple z-graded lie superalgebras and simple jordan superalgebras|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00927877708822224|journal=Communications in Algebra|volume=5|issue=13|pages=1375–1400|doi=10.1080/00927877708822224|issn=0092-7872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0016126|title=Group Theoretical Methods in Physics|last=Thierry-Mieg|first=Jean|date=1984|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=94–98|language=en|doi=10.1007/bfb0016126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unimodular lattices ==

Up to isometry there is only one even [[unimodular lattice]] in 15 dimensions or less &amp;mdash; the [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]]. Up to dimension [[24 (number)|24]] there is only one even unimodular lattice without [[root system|roots]], the [[Leech lattice]]. Three of the sporadic simple groups were discovered by Conway while investigating the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. For example, [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group itself modulo ±1. The groups [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], as well as a number of other sporadic groups, arise as stabilisers of various subsets of the Leech lattice.

== Codes ==

Some [[Error-correcting code|codes]] also stand out as exceptional objects, in particular the perfect binary Golay code which is closely related to the Leech lattice. The [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;, one of the sporadic simple groups, is the group of automorphisms of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]], and four more of the sporadic simple groups arise as various types of stabilizer subgroup of &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Block designs ==

An exceptional [[block design]] is the [[Steiner system]] S(5,8,24) whose automorphism group is the sporadic simple [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

The codewords of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]] have a length of 24 bits and have weights 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. This code can correct up to three errors. So every 24-bit word with weight 5 can be corrected to a codeword with weight 8. The bits of a 24-bit word can be thought of as specifying the possible subsets of a 24 element set. So the extended binary Golay code gives a unique 8 element subset for each 5 element subset. In fact, it defines S(5,8,24).

== Outer automorphisms ==
Certain families of groups generically have a certain [[outer automorphism group]], but in particular cases they have other, exceptional outer automorphisms.

Among families of finite simple groups, the only example is in the [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]]: for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3, n \neq 6&lt;/math&gt; the [[alternating group]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; has one outer automorphism (corresponding to conjugation by an odd element of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has no outer automorphisms. However, for &lt;math&gt;n=6,&lt;/math&gt; there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;S_6&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2), and correspondingly, the outer automorphism group of &lt;math&gt;A_6&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; (the group of order 2) but rather &lt;math&gt;C_2 \times C_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Klein four-group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/08/a_wrinkle_in_the_mathematical.html|title=A Wrinkle in the Mathematical Universe|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=17 August 2015|website=[[nLab|The n-Category Café]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/alt/A6/|title=ATLAS: Alternating group A6, Linear group L2(9), Symplectic group S4(2)', Mathieu group M10'|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Atlas of Finite Groups|Atlas of Finite Group Representations]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYMAg_Sj7hUC|title=The Finite Simple Groups|last=Wilson|first=Robert|date=2009-12-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781848009875|location=|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one instead considers A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as the (isomorphic) [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,9), then the outer automorphism is not exceptional; thus the exceptionalness can be seen as due to the [[exceptional isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;A_6 \cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,9).&lt;/math&gt; This exceptional outer automorphism is realized inside of the Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and similarly, M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; acts on a set of 12 elements in 2 different ways.

}}

Among [[Lie groups]], the [[spin group]] Spin(8) has an exceptionally large outer automorphism group (namely &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;), which corresponds to the exceptional symmetries of the [[Dynkin diagram]] D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[triality]].''

The exceptional symmetry of the D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; diagram also gives rise to the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg groups]].

== Algebraic topology ==
{{Main|Kervaire invariant}}
The [[Kervaire invariant]] is an invariant of a (4''k''+2)-dimensional manifold that measures whether the manifold could be [[Surgery theory|surgically]] converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. More specifically, the Kervaire invariant applies to a [[framed manifold]], that is, to a manifold equipped with an [[embedding]] into [[Euclidean space]] and a trivialization of the [[normal bundle]]. The Kervaire invariant problem is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For differentiable manifolds, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-and-physical-science/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/|title=Mathematicians Solve 45-Year-Old Kervaire Invariant Puzzle|last=Klarreich|first=Erica|date=20 July 2009|website=[[Simons Foundation]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1104.4523|first=Haynes|last=Miller|title=Kervaire Invariant One [after M. A. Hill, M. J. Hopkins, and D. C. Ravenel]|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five or six framed [[cobordism class]]es of manifolds having Kervaire invariant 1 are exceptional objects related to [[exotic sphere]]s. The first three cases are related to the complex numbers, quaternions and octonions respectively: a manifold of Kervaire invariant 1 can be constructed as the product of two spheres, with its exotic framing determined by the normed division algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranicki|first=Andrew|date=2011|title=Commentary on "On the parallelizability of the spheres" by R. Bott and J. Milnor and "On the nonexistence of elements of Hopf invariant one" by J. F. Adams|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2011-48-04/S0273-0979-2011-01345-3/|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=48|issue=4|pages=509–511|doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-2011-01345-3|issn=0273-0979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to similarities of dimensions, it is conjectured that the remaining cases (dimensions 30, 62 and 126) are related to the [[Rosenfeld projective plane]]s, which are defined over algebras constructed from the octonions. Specifically, it has been conjectured that there is a construction that takes these projective planes and produces a manifold with nonzero Kervaire invariant in two dimensions lower, but this remains unconfirmed.

In [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]], there exist structures known as [[SIC-POVM]]s or SICs, which correspond to maximal sets of complex [[equiangular lines]]. Some of the known SICs&amp;mdash;those in vector spaces of 2 and 3 dimensions, as well as certain solutions in 8 dimensions&amp;mdash;are considered exceptional objects and called "sporadic SICs". They differ from the other known SICs in ways that involve their symmetry groups, the [[Galois theory]] of the numerical values of their vector components, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appleby|first=Marcus|last2=Flammia|first2=Steven|last3=McConnell|first3=Gary|last4=Yard|first4=Jon|date=2017-08-01|title=SICs and Algebraic Number Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1042–1059|arxiv=1701.05200|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1042A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporadic SICs in dimension 8 are related to the integral octonions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Blake C.|date=2017-08-01|title=Sporadic SICs and the Normed Division Algebras|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1060–1064|arxiv=1605.01426|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1060S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections ==
Numerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects. Most common are objects related to [[8 (number)|8]] and [[24 (number)|24]] dimensions, noting that 24&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3.  By contrast, the [[pariah group]]s stand apart, as the name suggests.

=== 8 and 24 dimensions ===
Exceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.
* The octonions are 8-dimensional.
* The [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]] can be realized as the integral octonions (up to a scale factor).
* The exceptional Lie groups can be seen as symmetries of the octonions and structures derived from the octonions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week106.html|title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics: Week106|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=23 July 1997|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; further, the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; algebra is related to the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice, as the notation implies (the lattice is generated by the root system of the algebra).
* Triality occurs for Spin(8), which also connects to 8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3 &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;24.
Likewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include the following.
* The Leech lattice is 24-dimensional.
* Most sporadic simple groups can be related to the Leech lattice, or more broadly the Monster.
* The exceptional [[Jordan algebra]] has a representation in terms of 24&amp;times;24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.

These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves "exceptional". For example, in [[algebraic topology]], 8-fold real [[Bott periodicity]] can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [[modular forms]], the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [[Dedekind eta function]] and the [[modular discriminant]], which connection is deepened by [[Monstrous moonshine]], a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcherds|first=Richard E.|author-link=Richard Borcherds|date=1998|title=What is Moonshine?|url=http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/DMJDMV/xvol-icm/Fields/Borcherds.MAN.html|journal=Documenta Mathematica|volume=ICM 1|pages=607&amp;ndash;615|arxiv=math/9809110|via=|bibcode=1998math......9110B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In [[string theory]] and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena. For example, [[bosonic string theory]] requires a spacetime of dimension 26 which is directly related to the presence of 24 in the [[Dedekind eta function]]. Similarly, the possible dimensions of [[supergravity]] are related to the dimensions of the [[division algebras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baez|first=John C.|last2=Huerta|first2=John|date=October 2011|title=Division algebras and supersymmetry II|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.atmp/1349879112|journal=Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|language=EN|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1373–1410|arxiv=1003.3436|issn=1095-0761|via=|doi=10.4310/atmp.2011.v15.n5.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monstrous moonshine ===

Many of the exceptional objects in mathematics and physics have been found to be connected to each other. Developments such as the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures show how, for example, the [[Monster group]] is connected to [[string theory]]. The theory of [[modular forms]] shows how the algebra E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is connected to the Monster group. (In fact, well before the proof of the Monstrous moonshine conjecture, the [[J-invariant|elliptic ''j''-function]] was discovered to encode the representations of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V.G|title=An elucidation of "Infinite-Dimensional Algebras … and the very strange formula."

Below is a [[mind map]] showing how some of the exceptional objects in mathematics and mathematical physics are related.

[[File:Exceptionalmindmap2.png|600px]]

The connections can partly be explained by thinking of the algebras as a tower of lattice [[vertex operator algebra]]s. It just so happens that the vertex algebras at the bottom are so simple that they are isomorphic to familiar non-vertex algebras. Thus the connections can be seen simply as the consequence of some lattices being sub-lattices of others.

=== Supersymmetries ===
The [[Jordan superalgebra]]s are a parallel set of exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. These are the [[Lie superalgebra]]s which are related to Lorentzian lattices. This subject is less explored, and the connections between the objects are less well established. There are new conjectures parallel to the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures for these super-objects, involving different sporadic groups.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Unexceptional objects ==

=== Pathologies ===
{{See also|Pathological (mathematics)}}
"Exceptional" object is reserved for objects that are unusual, meaning rare, the exception, not for ''unexpected'' or ''non-standard'' objects. These unexpected-but-typical (or common) phenomena are generally referred to as [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], such as [[nowhere differentiable function]]s, or "exotic", as in [[exotic sphere]]s — there are exotic spheres in arbitrarily high dimension (not only a finite set of exceptions), and in many dimensions most (differential structures on) spheres are exotic.

=== Extremal objects ===
Exceptional objects must be distinguished from ''extremal'' objects: those that fall in a family and are the most extreme example by some measure are of interest, but not unusual in the way exceptional objects are. For example, the [[golden ratio]] ''φ'' has the simplest [[continued fraction]] approximation, and accordingly is most difficult to [[Diophantine approximation|approximate by rationals]]; however, it is but one of infinitely many such quadratic numbers (continued fractions).

Similarly, the (2,3,7) [[Schwarz triangle]] is the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, and the associated [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] is of particular interest, being the universal [[Hurwitz group]], and thus being associated with the [[Hurwitz curve]]s, the maximally symmetric algebraic curves. However, it falls in a family of such triangles ((2,4,7), (2,3,8), (3,3,7), etc.), and while the smallest, is not exceptional or unlike the others.

[[File:Georg Cantor3.jpg|thumb|Georg Cantor, c. 1870.]]

[[Georg Cantor]] published his first set theory article in 1874, and it contains the first theorems of transfinite [[set theory]], which studies [[infinite set]]s and their properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these theorems is "Cantor's revolutionary discovery" that the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable set|uncountably]], rather than [[countable set|countably]], infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dauben|1993|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem is proved using '''Cantor's first uncountability proof''', which differs from the more familiar proof using his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. The title of the article, "'''On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers'''" ("''Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen''"), refers to its first theorem: the set of real [[algebraic numbers]] is countable. In 1879, Cantor modified his uncountability proof by using the [[topological]] notion of a set being [[dense set|dense]] in an interval.

Cantor's 1874 article also contains a proof of the existence of [[transcendental number]]s. As early as 1930, mathematicians have disagreed on whether this proof is [[constructive proof|constructive or non-constructive]].&lt;ref&gt;"[Cantor's method is] a method that incidentally, contrary to a widespread interpretation, is fundamentally constructive and not merely existential." ({{harvnb|Fraenkel|1930|p=237}}; English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=823}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; Books as recent as 2014 and 2015 indicate that this disagreement has not been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;"Cantor's proof of the existence of transcendental numbers is not just an existence proof. It can, at least in principle, be used to construct an explicit transcendental number." ({{harvnb|Sheppard|2014|p=131}}.) "Meanwhile Georg Cantor, in 1874, had produced a revolutionary proof of the existence of transcendental numbers, without actually constructing any." ({{harvnb|Stewart|2015|p=285}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; Since Cantor's proof either constructs transcendental numbers or does not, an analysis of his article can determine whether his proof is constructive or non-constructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1994|pp=819&amp;ndash;821}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's correspondence with [[Richard Dedekind]] shows the development of his ideas and reveals that he had a choice between two proofs, one that uses the uncountability of the real numbers and one that does not.

Historians of mathematics have examined Cantor's article and the circumstances in which it was written. For example, they have discovered that Cantor was advised to leave out his uncountability theorem in the article he submitted; he added it during [[Galley proof|proofreading]]. They have traced this and other facts about the article to the influence of [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Leopold Kronecker]]. Historians have also studied Dedekind's contributions to the article, including his contributions to the theorem on the countability of the real algebraic numbers. In addition, they have looked at the article's legacy, which includes the impact that the uncountability theorem and the concept of countability have had on mathematics.

==The article==
Cantor's article is short, less than four and a half pages.&lt;ref&gt;In letter to Dedekind dated December 25, 1873, Cantor states that he has written and submitted "a short paper" titled ''On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers''. {{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|p=17}}; English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=847}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with a discussion of the real algebraic numbers and a statement of his first theorem: The set of real algebraic numbers can be put into [[one-to-one correspondence]] with the set of positive integers.&lt;ref name=Cantor1874&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1874}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|pp=840&amp;ndash;843}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor restates this theorem in terms more familiar to mathematicians of his time: The set of real algebraic numbers can be written as an infinite [[sequence]] in which each number appears only once.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=828}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's second theorem works with a [[closed interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], which is the set of real numbers ≥&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ≤&amp;nbsp;''b''. The theorem states: Given any sequence of real numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … and any interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], there is a number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] that is not contained in the given sequence. Hence, there are infinitely many such numbers.&lt;ref name=Ewald840_841&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1874|p=259}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|pp=840&amp;ndash;841}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of this theorem implies the "Hence" part. For example, let [0,&amp;nbsp;1] be the interval, and consider its [[pairwise disjoint]] subintervals {{nowrap|[0,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}],}} {{nowrap|[{{sfrac|3|4}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|7|8}}],}} {{nowrap|[{{sfrac|15|16}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|31|32}}],}} …. Applying the first part of the theorem to each subinterval produces infinitely many numbers in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] that are not contained in the given sequence.

Cantor observes that combining his two theorems yields a new proof of [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] that every interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] contains infinitely many [[transcendental number]]s.&lt;ref name=Ewald840_841 /&gt;

Cantor then remarks that his second theorem is:
{{quote|the reason why collections of real numbers forming a so-called continuum (such as, all real numbers which are ≥&amp;nbsp;0 and ≤&amp;nbsp;1) cannot correspond one-to-one with the collection (ν) [the collection of all positive integers]; thus I have found the clear difference between a so-called continuum and a collection like the totality of real algebraic numbers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1874|p=259}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=820}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This remark contains Cantor's uncountability theorem, which only states that an interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the set of positive integers. It does not state that this interval is an infinite set of larger [[cardinality]] than the set of positive integers. Cardinality is defined in Cantor's next article, which was published in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1878|p=242}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 1em" | Cantor does not explicitly prove his uncountability theorem, which follows easily from his second theorem. To prove it, we use [[proof by contradiction]]. Assume that the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the set of positive integers, or equivalently: The real numbers in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] can be written as a sequence in which each real number appears only once. Applying Cantor's second theorem to this sequence and [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] produces a real number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] that does not belong to the sequence. This contradicts the original assumption, and proves the uncountability theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Our proof is nearly the same as the proof of Corollary 2 in {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=820}}. The only difference is that we specify the contradiction.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Cantor only states his uncountability theorem. He does not use it in any proofs.&lt;ref name=Cantor1874 /&gt;

==The proofs==

===First theorem===

To prove that the set of real algebraic numbers is countable, define the ''height'' of a [[polynomial]] of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] ''n'' with integer [[coefficient]]s as: ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|, where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the coefficients of the polynomial. Order the polynomials by their height, and order the real [[Root of a polynomial|root]]s of polynomials of the same height by numeric order. Since there are only a finite number of roots of polynomials of a given height, these orderings put the real algebraic numbers into a sequence. Cantor went a step further and produced a sequence in which each real algebraic number appears just once. He did this by only using polynomials that are [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1874|pp=259&amp;ndash;260}}.

===Second theorem===
Only the first part of Cantor's second theorem needs to be proved. It states: Given any sequence of real numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;… and any interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], there is a number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] that is not contained in the given sequence. We simplify Cantor's proof by using [[open interval]]s. The open interval (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') is the set of real numbers greater than&amp;nbsp;''a'' and less than&amp;nbsp;''b''.

To find a number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] that is not contained in the given sequence, construct two sequences of real numbers as follows: Find the first two numbers of the given sequence that are in (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''). Denote the smaller of these two numbers by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the larger by ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  Similarly, find the first two numbers of the given sequence that are in (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Denote the smaller by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the larger by ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Continuing this procedure generates a sequence of intervals (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), (''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;… such that each interval in the sequence contains all succeeding intervals—that is, it generates a sequence of [[nested intervals]]. This implies that the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;… is increasing and the sequence ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;… is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1874|pp=260&amp;ndash;261}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|pp=841&amp;ndash;842}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Either the number of intervals generated is finite or infinite. If finite, let (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) be the last interval. If infinite, take the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]s ''a''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'', either ''a''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; or ''a''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, there are three cases to consider:{{Anchor|Cases}}

The proof is complete since, in all cases, at least one real number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] has been found that is not contained in the given sequence.{{efn-ua|The difference between our proof and Cantor's is that he generates the sequence of closed intervals [''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;].

By generating a sequence of open intervals, we avoid working with the closed intervals.}}

Cantor's proofs are constructive and have been used to write a [[computer program]] that generates the digits of a transcendental number. This program applies Cantor's construction to a sequence containing all the real algebraic numbers between 0 and 1. The article that discusses this program gives some of its output, which shows how the construction generates a transcendental.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=822}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example of Cantor's construction===
An example illustrates how Cantor's construction works. Consider the sequence: {{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|2|3}}, {{sfrac|1|4}}, {{sfrac|3|4}}, {{sfrac|1|5}}, {{sfrac|2|5}}, {{sfrac|3|5}}, {{sfrac|4|5}}, … This sequence is obtained by ordering the [[rational number]]s in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) by increasing denominators, ordering those with the same denominator by increasing numerators, and omitting [[reducible fraction]]s.{{efn-ua|This example is nearly the same as an exercise in {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=823}}. The only difference is that this sequence contains only [[irreducible fraction]]s, while Gray's sequence includes the reducible fractions of the initial interval.}} The table below shows the first five steps of the construction. The table's first column contains the intervals (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). The second column lists the terms visited during the search for the first two terms in (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). These two terms are in red.

Since the sequence contains all the rational numbers in (0,&amp;nbsp;1), the construction generates an [[irrational number]], which turns out to be {{sqrt|2}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

Cantor's construction produces mediants because the rational numbers were sequenced by increasing denominator. The first interval in the table is &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}).&lt;/math&gt; Since &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; are adjacent in &lt;math&gt;F_3,&lt;/math&gt; their mediant &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5}&lt;/math&gt; is the first fraction in the sequence between &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; Hence, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} &lt; \frac{2}{5} &lt; \frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; In this inequality, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest denominator, so the second fraction is the mediant of &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2},&lt;/math&gt; which equals &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{7}.&lt;/math&gt; This implies: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} &lt; \frac{2}{5} &lt; \frac{3}{7} &lt; \frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, the next interval is &lt;math&gt;(\frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{7}).&lt;/math&gt;

We will prove that the endpoints of the intervals converge to the continued fraction &lt;math&gt;[0; 2, 2, \dots].&lt;/math&gt; This continued fraction is the limit of its convergents:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p_n}{q_n} = [0; 2, \dots, 2]\;\;(n\;2\text{'s}).&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;p_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; sequences satisfy the equations:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LeVeque|1956|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_0 = 0\;\;\;\;\;\;\;p_1 = 1\;\;\;\;\;\;\;p_{n+1} = 2p_n + p_{n-1} \text{ for } n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q_0 = 1\;\;\;\;\;\;\;q_1 = 2\;\;\;\;\;\;\;q_{n+1} = 2q_n + q_{n-1} \text{ for } n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;

First, we prove by induction that for odd ''n'', the ''n''-th interval in the table is: 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p_n + p_{n-1}}{q_n + q_{n-1}}, \frac{p_n}{q_n}\right)\!,&lt;/math&gt; 
and for even ''n'', the interval's endpoints are reversed: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p_n}{q_n}, \frac{p_n + p_{n-1}}{q_n + q_{n-1}}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

This is true for the first interval since:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p_1 + p_0}{q_1 + q_0}, \frac{p_1}{q_1}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that the inductive hypothesis is true for the ''k''-th interval. If ''k'' is odd, this interval is:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p_k + p_{k-1}}{q_k + q_{k-1}}, \frac{p_k}{q_k}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;

The mediant of its endpoints &lt;math&gt;\frac{2p_k + p_{k-1}}{2q_k + q_{k-1}} = \frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the first fraction in the sequence between these endpoints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Hence, &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_k + p_{k-1}}{q_k + q_{k-1}} &lt; \frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}} &lt; \frac{p_k}{q_k}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In this inequality, &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_k}{q_k}&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest denominator, so the second fraction is the mediant of &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_k}{q_k},&lt;/math&gt; which equals &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{k+1} + p_k}{p_{k+1} + q_k}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This implies: &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_k + p_{k-1}}{q_k + q_{k-1}} &lt; \frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}} &lt; \frac{p_{k+1} + p_k}{p_{k+1} + q_k} &lt; \frac{p_k}{q_k}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Therefore, the (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-st interval is &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}}, \frac{p_{k+1} + p_k}{p_{k+1} + q_k}\right)\!.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is the desired interval; &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{k+1}}{q_{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the left endpoint because ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is even. Thus, the inductive hypothesis is true for the (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-st interval. For even ''k'', the proof is similar. This completes the inductive proof.

Since the right endpoints of the intervals are decreasing and every other endpoint is &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{2n-1}}{q_{2n-1}},&lt;/math&gt; their limit equals
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n}.&lt;/math&gt; The left endpoints have the same limit because they are increasing and every other endpoint is &lt;math&gt;\frac{p_{2n}}{q_{2n}}.&lt;/math&gt; As mentioned above, this limit is the continued fraction &lt;math&gt;[0; 2, 2, \dots],&lt;/math&gt; which equals &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}-1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weisstein|2003|p=541}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's second uncountability proof ==
=== Everywhere dense ===
In 1879, Cantor published a new uncountability proof that modifies his 1874 proof. He first defines the [[topological]] notion of a point set ''P'' being "everywhere [[dense set|dense]] in an interval" (which is quite often shortened to "dense in an interval"):{{efn-ua|Cantor was not the first to define "everywhere dense" but his terminology was adopted with or without the "everywhere" (everywhere dense: {{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|p=15}}; dense: {{harvnb|Kelley|1991|p=49}}). In 1870, [[Hermann Hankel]] had defined this concept using different terminology: "a multitude of points … ''fill the segment'' if no interval, however small, can be given within the segment in which one does not find at least one point of that multitude" ({{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=155}}). Hankel was building on [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]'s 1829 article that contains the [[Dirichlet function]], a non-([[Riemann integral|Riemann]]) [[integrable function]] whose value is 0 for [[rational number]]s and 1 for [[irrational number]]s. ({{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=149}}.)}}

:If ''P'' lies partially or completely in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β], then the remarkable case can happen that ''all'' intervals [γ,&amp;nbsp;δ] contained in [α,&amp;nbsp;β], ''no matter how small,'' contain points of ''P''.  In such a case, we will say that ''P'' is ''everywhere dense in the interval'' [α,&amp;nbsp;β].{{efn-ua|The original German text from {{harvnb|Cantor|1879|p=2}} (Cantor's closed set notation (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) is translated to [α,&amp;nbsp;β]):&lt;br&gt;
Liegt ''P'' theilweise oder ganz im Intervalle (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β), so kann der bemerkenswerthe Fall eintreten, dass ''jedes noch so kleine'' in (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) enthaltene Intervall (γ&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;δ) Punkte von ''P'' enthält. In einem solchen Falle wollen wir sagen, dass ''P'' ''im Intervalle'' (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) ''überall-dicht'' sei.}}

We will use ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'', ''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'' rather than α,&amp;nbsp;β, γ,&amp;nbsp;δ. Cantor assumes that an interval [''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''] satisfies ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''c''.

Since our discussion of Cantor's 1874 proof was simplified using by open intervals rather than closed intervals, the same simplification is used here. This requires an equivalent definition of everywhere dense: A set ''P'' is everywhere dense in the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] if and only if every subinterval (''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') of [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] contains at least one point of ''P''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkhangel'skii|Fedorchuk|1990|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor did not specify how many points of ''P'' a subinterval (''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') must contain. He did not need to specify this because assuming that every subinterval contains at least one point of ''P'' implies that they contain infinitely many points of ''P''. This is proved by generating a sequence of points belonging to both ''P'' and (''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''). Since ''P'' is dense in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], the subinterval (''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') contains at least one point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P''. Now consider the subinterval (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''d''). It contains at least one point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P'', which satisfies ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, after generating ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the subinterval (x&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''d'') is used to obtain the point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which satisfies ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. The points ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are all unique and belong to both ''P'' and (''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'').

=== Cantor's 1879 proof ===
Cantor's 1879 proof is the same as his 1874 proof except for a new proof of first part of his [[#Second theorem|second theorem]]: Given any sequence ''P'' of real numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;… and any interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], there is a number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] that is not contained in the sequence ''P''. The new proof has only two cases.&lt;ref group=proof name=p&gt;Since Cantor's proof has not been published in English, an English translation is given alongside the original German text, which is from {{harvnb|Cantor|1879|pp=5–7}}. The translation starts one sentence before the proof because this sentence mentions Cantor's 1874 proof. Cantor states it was printed in Borchardt's Journal. Crelle’s Journal was also called Borchardt’s Journal from 1856-1880 when [[Carl Wilhelm Borchardt]] edited the journal ({{harvnb|Audin|2011|p=80}}). Square brackets are used to identify this mention of Cantor's earlier proof, to clarify the translation, and to provide page numbers. Also, "Mannichfaltigkeit" (manifold) has been translated to "set" and Cantor's notation for closed sets (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) has been translated to [α,&amp;nbsp;β]. Cantor changed his terminology from Mannichfaltigkeit to Menge (set) in his 1883 article, which introduced sets of [[ordinal number]]s ({{harvnb|Kanamori|2012|p=5}}). Currently in mathematics, a [[manifold]] is type of [[topological space]].

&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;But this contradicts a very general theorem, which we have 
proved with full rigor in Borchardt's Journal, Vol. 77, page 260; namely, the following theorem:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|5}}''"If one has a simply [countably] infinite sequence''&lt;br&gt; 
{{space|12}}ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;
''of real, unequal numbers that proceed according to some rule, then in every given interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β] a number η (and thus infinitely many of them) can be specified that does not occur in this sequence (as a member of it)."''&lt;br&gt;

{{space|5}}In view of the great interest in this theorem, not only in the present discussion, but also in many other arithmetical as well as analytical relations, it might not be superfluous if we develop the argument followed there [Cantor's 1874 proof] more clearly here by using simplifying modifications.&lt;br&gt;

{{space|5}}Starting with the sequence:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;
(which we give [denote by] the symbol (ω)) and an arbitrary interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β], where α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β, we will now demonstrate that in this interval a real number η can be found that does ''not'' occur in (ω).&lt;br&gt;

{{space|5}}I. We first notice that if our set (ω) is ''not everywhere dense'' in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β], then within this interval another interval [γ,&amp;nbsp;δ] must be present, all of whose numbers do not belong to (ω). From the interval [γ,&amp;nbsp;δ], one can then choose any number for η. It lies in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β] and definitely does ''not'' occur in our sequence (ω). Thus, this case presents no special considerations and we can move on to the ''more difficult'' case.

{{space|5}}II. Let the set (ω) be ''everywhere dense'' in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β]. In this case, every interval [γ,δ] located in [α,β], however small, contains numbers of our sequence (ω). To show that, ''nevertheless,'' numbers η in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β] exist that do not occur in (ω), we employ the following observation.

{{space|5}}Since some numbers in our sequence:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;

|[Seite 5]&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;Dem widerspricht aber ein sehr allgemeiner Satz, welchen wir in Borchardt's Journal, Bd. 77, pag. 260, mit aller Strenge bewiesen haben, nämlich der folgende Satz:

{{space|5}}''"Hat man eine einfach unendliche Reihe''&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;
''von reellen, ungleichen Zahlen, die nach irgend einem Gesetz fortschreiten, so lässt sich in jedem vorgegebenen, Intervalle (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) eine Zahl η (und folglich lassen sich deren unendlich viele) angeben, welche nicht in jener Reihe (als Glied derselben) vorkommt."''

{{space|5}}In Anbetracht des grossen Interesses, welches sich an diesen Satz, nicht blos bei der gegenwärtigen Erörterung, sondern auch in vielen anderen sowohl arithmetischen, wie analytischen Beziehungen, knüpft, dürfte es nicht überflüssig sein, wenn wir die dort befolgte Beweisführung [Cantors 1874 Beweis], unter Anwendung vereinfachender Modificationen, hier deutlicher entwickeln.

{{space|5}}Unter Zugrundelegung der Reihe:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;
(welcher wir das Zeichen (ω) beilegen) und eines beliebigen Intervalles (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β), wo α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β ist, soll also nun gezeigt werden, dass in diesem Intervalle eine reelle Zahl η gefunden werden kann, welche in (ω) ''nicht'' vorkommt.

{{space|5}}I. Wir bemerken zunächst, dass wenn unsre Mannichfaltigkeit (ω) in dem Intervall (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β)  ''nicht überall-dicht'' ist, innerhalb dieses Intervalles ein anderes (γ&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;δ) vorhanden sein muss, dessen Zahlen sämmtlich nicht zu (ω) gehören; man kann alsdann für η irgend eine Zahl des Intervalls (γ&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;δ) wählen, sie liegt im Intervalle (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) und kommt sicher in unsrer Reihe (ω) ''nicht'' vor. Dieser Fall bietet daher keinerlei besondere Umstände; und wir können zu dem ''schwierigeren'' übergehen.

{{space|5}}II. Die Mannichfaltigkeit (ω) sei im Intervalle (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) ''überall-dicht''. In diesem Falle enthält jedes, noch so kleine in (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) gelegene Intervall (γ&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;δ) Zahlen unserer Reihe (ω). Um zu zeigen, dass ''nichtsdestoweniger'' Zahlen η im Intervalle (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) existiren, welche in (ω) nicht vorkommen, stellen wir die folgende Betrachtung an.

{{space|5}}Da in unserer Reihe:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;

|[Page 6]&lt;br&gt;
definitely occur ''within'' the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β], one of these numbers must have the ''least index,'' let it be ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, and another: ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; with the next larger index.

{{space|5}}Let the smaller of the two numbers  ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; be denoted by α', the larger by β'. (Their equality is impossible because we assumed that our sequence consists of nothing but unequal numbers.)

{{space|5}}Then according to the definition:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α'&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β'&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β{{space|hair}},&lt;br&gt;
furthermore:&lt;br&gt;                           
{{space|17}}κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}};&lt;br&gt;
and it should also be noted that all numbers ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; of our sequence, 
for which μ ≤ κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, do ''not'' lie in the interior of the interval [α',&amp;nbsp;β'], as is immediately clear from the definition of the numbers κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, let ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; be the two numbers of our sequence with smallest indices that fall in the ''interior'' of the interval [α',&amp;nbsp;β'] and let the smaller of the numbers ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; be denoted by α&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the larger by β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

{{space|5}}Then one has: &lt;br&gt; 
{{space|12}}α'&amp;nbsp;&lt; α&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β'{{space|hair}},&lt;br&gt;
{{space|14}}κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}};&lt;br&gt;
and one sees that all numbers ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; of our sequence, for which μ&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, do ''not'' fall into the ''interior'' of the interval [α&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&amp;nbsp;β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;].

{{space|5}} After one has followed this rule to reach an interval {{nowrap|[α&lt;sup&gt;(ν - 1)&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sup&gt;(ν - 1)&lt;/sup&gt;]}}, the next interval is produced by selecting the first two (i. e. with lowest indices) numbers of our sequence (ω) (let them be {{nowrap|ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν - 1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) that fall into the ''interior'' of {{nowrap|[α&lt;sup&gt;(ν - 1)&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν - 1)&lt;/sup&gt;]}}. Let the smaller of these two numbers be denoted  by α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;, the larger by β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{space|5}}The interval [α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;] then lies in the ''interior'' of all preceding intervals and has the ''specific'' relation with our sequence (ω) that all numbers ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;, for which μ ≤ κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;, ''definitely do not lie in its interior''. Since obviously:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}{{nowrap|κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  . . . , ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν – 2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν – 1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}, . . . }}&lt;br&gt;
and these numbers, as indices, are ''whole'' numbers, so:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2ν{{space|hair}},&lt;br&gt;
and hence:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ν&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}};&lt;br&gt;
thus, we can certainly say (and this is sufficient for the following):&lt;br&gt;

{{space|5}}''That if ν is an arbitrary whole number, the [real] quantity ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; lies outside the interval [α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;].''

|[Seite 6]&lt;br&gt;
sicher Zahlen ''innerhalb'' des Intervalls (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) vorkommen, so muss eine von diesen Zahlen den ''kleinsten Index'' haben, sie sei ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, und eine andere: ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; mit dem nächst grösseren Index behaftet sein.

{{space|5}}Die kleinere der beiden Zahlen ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; werde mit α', die grössere mit β' bezeichnet. (Ihre Gleichheit ist ausgeschlossen, weil wir voraussetzten, dass unsere Reihe aus lauter ungleichen Zahlen besteht.)

{{space|5}}Es ist alsdann der Definition nach:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α'&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β'&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β{{space|hair}},&lt;br&gt;

{{space|17}}κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}};&lt;br&gt;
und ausserdem ist zu bemerken, dass alle Zahlen ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; unserer Reihe, 
für welche μ ≤ κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''nicht'' im Innern des Intervalls (α'&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β') liegen, wie aus der Bestimmung der Zahlen κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sofort erhellt. Ganz ebenso mögen ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; die beiden mit den kleinsten Indices versehenen Zahlen unserer Reihen [see note 1 below] sein, welche in das ''Innere'' des Intervalls (α'&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β') fallen und die kleinere der Zahlen ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; werde mit α&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, die grössere mit β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; bezeichnet.&lt;br&gt;

und man erkennt, dass alle Zahlen ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; unserer Reihe, für welche μ&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''nicht'' in das ''Innere'' des Intervalls (α&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) fallen.

{{space|5}}Nachdem man unter Befolgung des gleichen Gesetzes zu einem Intervall {{nowrap|(α&lt;sup&gt;(ν - 1)&lt;/sup&gt;, . . . β&lt;sup&gt;(ν - 1)&lt;/sup&gt;)}} gelangt ist, ergiebt sich das folgende Intervall dadurch aus demselben, dass man die beiden ersten (d. h. mit niedrigsten Indices versehenen) Zahlen unserer Reihe (ω) aufstellt (sie seien ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν – 1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; und ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), welche in das ''Innere'' von {{nowrap|(α&lt;sup&gt;(ν – 1)&lt;/sup&gt; . . . β&lt;sup&gt;(ν – 1)&lt;/sup&gt;)}} fallen; die kleinere dieser beiden Zahlen werde mit α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;, die grössere mit β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt; bezeichnet.

{{space|5}}Das Intervall (α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;) liegt alsdann im ''Innern'' aller vorangegangenen Intervalle und hat zu unserer Reihe (ω) die ''eigenthümliche'' 
Beziehung, dass alle Zahlen ω&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;, für welche μ ≤ κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt; ''sicher nicht in seinem Innern'' liegen.  Da offenbar:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}{{nowrap|κ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; κ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; κ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;  . . . , ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν – 2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν – 1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ω&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}, . . . }}

und diese Zahlen, als Indices, ''ganze'' Zahlen sind, so ist:&lt;br&gt;

und daher:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}ν&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;κ&lt;sub&gt;2ν&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}};&lt;br&gt;
wir können daher, und dies ist für das Folgende ausreichend, gewiss sagen:&lt;br&gt;

{{space|5}}''Dass, wenn ν eine beliebige ganze Zahl ist, die Grösse ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; ausserhalb des Intervalls (α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;) liegt.''

{{space|12}}{{nowrap|A {{=}} Lim α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;  for  ν {{=}} ∞.}}

{{space|5}}The same applies to the numbers β', β&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, β&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;., β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;., which are continually decreasing and likewise lying in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β]. We call their limit B, so that:&lt;br&gt; 
{{space|12}}{{nowrap|B {{=}} Lim β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;  for  ν {{=}} ∞.}}

{{space|5}}Obviously, one has:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}{{nowrap|α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; A ≤ B &lt; β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

{{space|5}}But it is easy to see that the case A&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;B can ''not'' occur here since otherwise every number ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; of our sequence would lie ''outside'' of the interval [A,&amp;nbsp;B] by lying outside the interval [α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;]. So our sequence (ω) would ''not'' be ''everywhere dense'' in the interval [α,&amp;nbsp;β], contrary 
to the assumption.

{{space|5}}Thus, there only remains the case A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;B and now it is demonstrated that the number:&lt;br&gt; 
{{space|12}}η&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;B&lt;br&gt; 
does ''not'' occur in our sequence (ω).

{{space|5}}If it were a member of our sequence, such as the ν&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, then one would have: η = ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;.

{{space|5}}But the latter equation is not possible for any value of ν because η is in the ''interior'' of the interval [α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;], but ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt; lies ''outside'' of it.

{{space|5}}Man hat offenbar:&lt;br&gt;
{{space|12}}{{nowrap|α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; A ≤ B &lt; β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

{{space|5}}Es ist aber leicht zu sehen, dass der Fall A&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;B hier ''nicht'' vorkommen kann; da sonst jede Zahl ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;, unserer Reihe ''ausserhalb'' des Intervalles (A&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;B) liegen würde, indem ω&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;, ausserhalb des Intervalls (α&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt; . . . β&lt;sup&gt;(ν)&lt;/sup&gt;) gelegen ist; unsere Reihe (ω) wäre im Intervall (α&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;β) ''nicht überalldicht,'' gegen die Voraussetzung.

In the first case, ''P'' is not dense in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. By definition, ''P'' is dense if and only if for all {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'') ⊆ [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}}, there is an ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''P'' such that {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ (''c'', ''d'')}}. Taking the negation of each side of the "if and only if" produces: ''P'' is not dense in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] if and only if there exists a {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'') ⊆ [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']}} such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''P'', we have {{nowrap|''x'' ∉ (''c'', ''d'')}}. Thus, every number in (''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') is not contained in the sequence ''P''.&lt;ref group=proof name=p /&gt; This case handles [[#Cases|cases 1 and 3]] of Cantor's 1874 proof.

In the second case, ''P'' is dense in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. The denseness of ''P'' is used to [[recursively define]] a nested sequence of intervals that excludes all elements of ''P''. The definition begins with
''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''. The definition's inductive case starts with the interval (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which because of the denseness of ''P'' contains infinitely many elements of ''P''. From these elements of ''P'', we take the two with smallest indices and denote the least of these two numbers by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the greatest by ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Cantor proved that for all&amp;nbsp;''n''{{space|hair}}:{{space|hair}} {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∉ (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.&lt;ref group=proof name=p /&gt; We proved this in a [[#x_n not in|previous section]].

The sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is increasing and bounded above by ''b'', so it has a limit ''A'', which satisfies ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''A''. The sequence ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is decreasing and bounded below by ''a'', so it has a limit ''B'', which satisfies ''B''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; implies ''A''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''B''. Therefore, {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''A'' ≤ ''B'' &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If ''A''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''B'', then for every ''n'': ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∉&amp;nbsp;(''A'',&amp;nbsp;''B'') because ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not in the larger interval (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). This contradicts ''P'' being dense in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. Therefore, ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B''. Since for all ''n'': {{nowrap|''A'' ∈ (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} but {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∉ (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the limit ''A'' is a real number that is not contained in the sequence ''P''.&lt;ref group=proof name=p /&gt; This case handles [[#Cases|case 2]] of Cantor's 1874 proof.

Cantor's new proof first takes care of the easy case of the sequence ''P'' not being dense in the interval. Then it deals with the more difficult case of ''P'' being dense. This division into cases not only indicates which sequences are most difficult to handle, but it also reveals the important role denseness plays in the proof.&lt;ref group=proof name=p /&gt;

In the [[#Example of Cantor's construction|Example of Cantor's construction]], each successive nested interval excludes  rational numbers for two different reasons. It will exclude the finitely many rationals visited in the search for the first two rationals within the interval (these two rationals will have the least indices). These rationals are then used to form an interval that excludes the rationals visited in the search along with infinitely many more rationals. However, it still contains infinitely many rationals since our sequence of rationals is dense in [0, 1]. Forming this interval from the two rationals with the least indices guarantees that this interval excludes an initial segment of our sequence that contains at least two more elements than the preceding initial segment. Since the denseness of our sequence guarantees that this process never ends, all rationals will be excluded.&lt;ref group=proof name=p /&gt; Because of the ordering of the rationals in our sequence, the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the nested intervals is the [[#Number generated|set {{{sqrt|2}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}]].

==The development of Cantor's ideas==
The development leading to Cantor's 1874 article appears in the correspondence between Cantor and [[Richard Dedekind]]. On November 29, 1873, Cantor asked Dedekind whether the collection of positive integers and the collection of positive real numbers "can be corresponded so that each individual of one collection corresponds to one and only one individual of the other?" Cantor added that collections having such a correspondence include the collection of positive rational numbers, and collections of the form (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. , ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''ν'' are positive integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=827}}; {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=844}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedekind replied that he was unable to answer Cantor's question, and said that it "did not deserve too much effort because it has no particular practical interest." Dedekind also sent Cantor a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable.&lt;ref name=Noether18&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|p=18}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=848}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Cantor's December 2nd letter}}
On December 2, Cantor responded that his question does have interest: "It would be nice if it could be answered; for example, provided that it could be answered ''no'', one would have a new proof of [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] that there are transcendental numbers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|p=13}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=827}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, Cantor sent Dedekind a proof by contradiction that the set of real numbers is uncountable. Cantor starts by assuming the real numbers can be written as a sequence. Then he applies a construction to this sequence to produce a real number not in the sequence, thus contradicting his assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|pp=14&amp;ndash;15}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|pp=845&amp;ndash;846}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters of December 2 and 7 lead to a non-constructive proof of the existence of transcendental numbers.

On December 9, Cantor announced the theorem that allowed him to construct transcendental numbers as well as prove the uncountability of the set of real numbers:

{{quote|I show directly that if I start with a sequence&lt;br /&gt;(I)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, …&lt;br /&gt;I can determine, in ''every'' given interval [''α'',&amp;nbsp;''β''], a number ''η'' that is not included in (I).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|p=16}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=827}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is the second theorem in Cantor's article. It comes from realizing that his construction can be applied to any sequence, not just to sequences that supposedly enumerate the real numbers. So Cantor had a choice between two proofs that demonstrate the existence of transcendental numbers: one proof is constructive, but the other is not. We now compare the proofs assuming that we have a sequence consisting of all the real algebraic numbers.

The constructive proof applies Cantor's construction to this sequence and the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] to produce a transcendental number in this interval.&lt;ref name=Ewald840_841 /&gt;

The non-constructive proof uses two proofs by contradiction:
# The proof by contradiction used to prove the uncountability theorem (see [[#Proof of Cantor's uncountability theorem|Proof of Cantor's uncountability theorem]]).
# The proof by contradiction used to prove the existence of transcendental numbers from the countability of the real algebraic numbers and the uncountability of real numbers. [[#Cantor's December 2nd letter|Cantor's December 2nd letter]] mentions this existence proof but does not contain it. Here is a proof: Assume that there are no transcendental numbers in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. Then all the numbers in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] are algebraic. This implies that they form a [[subsequence]] of the sequence of all real algebraic numbers, which contradicts Cantor's uncountability theorem. Thus, the assumption that there are no transcendental numbers in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] is false. Therefore, there is a transcendental number in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''].{{efn-ua|The beginning of our proof is derived from the proof below by restricting the numbers in this proof to the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. However, we derive the contradiction by using a subsequence because Cantor was using sequences in his 1873 work on countability.&lt;br&gt;'''''German text:'' Satz 68. Es gibt transzendente Zahlen.'''&lt;br&gt;Gäbe es nämlich keine transzendenten Zahlen, so wären alle Zahlen algebraisch, das Kontinuum also identisch mit der Menge aller algebraischen Zahlen. Das ist aber unmöglich, weil die Menge aller algebraischen Zahlen abzählbar ist, das Kontinuum aber nicht.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perron|1921|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''''Translation:'' Theorem 68. There are transcendental numbers.'''&lt;br&gt; If there were no transcendental numbers, then all numbers would be algebraic. Hence, the [[continuum (set theory)|continuum]] would be identical to the set of all algebraic numbers. However, this is impossible because the set of all algebraic numbers is countable, but the continuum is not.}}

Cantor chose to publish the constructive proof, which not only produces a transcendental number but is also shorter and avoids two proofs by contradiction. The non-constructive proof from Cantor's correspondence is simpler than the one above because it works with all the real numbers rather than the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. This eliminates the subsequence step and all occurrences of [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] in the second proof by contradiction.&lt;ref name=Ewald840_841 /&gt;

==The disagreement about Cantor's existence proof==
[[File:Oskar Perron.jpg|thumb|upright=0.93|Oskar Perron]]
The correspondence containing Cantor's non-constructive reasoning was published in 1937. By then, other mathematicians had rediscovered its non-constructive proof. As early as 1921, this proof was attributed to Cantor and criticized for not producing any transcendental numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1994|pp=827&amp;ndash;828}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year, [[Oskar Perron]] stated: "… Cantor's proof for the existence of transcendental numbers has, along with its simplicity and elegance, the great disadvantage that it is only an existence proof; it does not enable us to actually specify even a single transcendental number."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perron|1921|p=162}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=828}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Abraham Halevi Fraenkel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.93|Abraham Fraenkel]]
Some mathematicians have attempted to correct this misunderstanding of Cantor's work. In 1930, the [[set theory|set theorist]] [[Abraham Fraenkel]] stated that Cantor's method is "… a method that incidentally, contrary to a widespread interpretation, is fundamentally constructive and not merely existential."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fraenkel|1930|p=237}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=823}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Irving Kaplansky]] wrote: "It is often said that Cantor's proof is not 'constructive,' and so does not yield a tangible transcendental number. This remark is not justified. If we set up a definite listing of all algebraic numbers … and then apply the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal procedure]] …, we get a perfectly definite transcendental number (it could be computed to any number of decimal places)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaplansky|1972|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's diagonal argument has often replaced his 1874 construction in expositions of his proof. The diagonal argument is constructive and produces a more efficient computer program than his 1874 construction. Using it, a computer program has been written that computes the digits of a transcendental number in [[polynomial time]]. The program that uses Cantor's 1874 construction requires at least [[sub-exponential time]].{{efn-ua|The program using the diagonal method produces &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; digits in [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|&lt;math&gt;{\color{Blue}O}(n^2 \log^2 n \log \log n)&lt;/math&gt;]] steps, while the program using the 1874 method requires at least &lt;math&gt;O(2^{\sqrt[3]{n}})&lt;/math&gt; steps to produce &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; digits. ({{harvnb|Gray|1994|pp=822&amp;ndash;823}}.)}}

The disagreement about Cantor's proof occurs because two groups of mathematicians are talking about different proofs: the constructive one that Cantor published and the non-constructive one that was later rediscovered.  The opinion that Cantor's proof is non-constructive appears in some books that were quite successful as measured by the length of time new editions or reprints appeared—for example: [[Eric Temple Bell|Eric Temple Bell's]] ''[[Men of Mathematics]]'' (1937; still being reprinted), [[Godfrey Hardy]] and [[E. M. Wright|E. M. Wright's]] ''An Introduction to the [[Theory of numbers|Theory of Numbers]]'' (1938; 2008 6th edition), [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane|Saunders Mac Lane's]] ''A Survey of [[Modern Algebra]]'' (1941; 1997 5th edition), and [[Michael Spivak|Michael Spivak's]] ''[[Calculus]]'' (1967; 2008 4th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1937|pp=568&amp;ndash;569}}; {{harvnb|Hardy|Wright|1938|p=159}} (6th ed., pp. 205&amp;ndash;206); {{harvnb|Birkhoff|Mac Lane|1941|p=392}}, (5th ed., pp. 436&amp;ndash;437); {{harvnb|Spivak|1967|pp=369&amp;ndash;370}} (4th ed., pp. 448&amp;ndash;449).&lt;/ref&gt; Since these books view Cantor's proof as non-constructive, they do not mention his constructive proof. On the other hand, the quotations above from Fraenkel and Kaplansky show that they knew Cantor's work can be used non-constructively. The disagreement about Cantor's proof shows no sign of being resolved: since 2014, at least two books have appeared stating that Cantor's proof is constructive, and at least four have appeared stating that his proof does not construct any (or a single) transcendental.&lt;ref&gt;Proof is constructive: {{harvnb|Dasgupta|2014|p=107}}; {{harvnb|Sheppard|2014|pp=131&amp;ndash;132}}. Proof is non-constructive: {{harvnb|Jarvis|2014|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Chowdhary|2015|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2015|p=285}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|Tall|2015|p=333}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asserting that Cantor gave a non-constructive proof can lead to erroneous statements about the [[history of mathematics]]. In ''A Survey of Modern Algebra,'' Birkhoff and Mac Lane state: "Cantor's argument for this result [Not every real number is algebraic] was at first rejected by many mathematicians, since it did not exhibit any specific transcendental number." Birkhoff and Mac Lane are talking about the non-constructive proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birkhoff|Mac Lane|1941|p=392}}, (5th ed., pp. 436&amp;ndash;437).&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's proof produces transcendental numbers, and there appears to be no evidence that his argument was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=828}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Leopold Kronecker]], who had strict views on what is acceptable in mathematics and who could have delayed publication of Cantor's article, did not delay it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1989}}; {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=828}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, applying Cantor's construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers produces a limiting process that Kronecker accepted—namely, it determines a number to any required degree of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|1989|pp=74&amp;ndash;75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Kronecker's opinion was: "Definitions must contain the means of reaching a decision in a finite number of steps, and existence proofs must be conducted so that the quantity in question can be calculated with any required degree of accuracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burton|1995|p=595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So Kronecker would accept Cantor's argument as a valid existence proof, but he would not accept its conclusion that transcendental numbers exist. For Kronecker, they do not exist because their definition contains no means for deciding in a finite number of steps whether or not a given number is transcendental.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dauben|1979|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To prove that Cantor's construction calculates numbers to any required degree of accuracy, we need to prove: Given a ''k'', an ''n'' can be computed such that 
{{nowrap|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; – ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ {{sfrac|1|''k''}}}} where (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',&amp;nbsp;''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is the {{nowrap|''n''-th}} interval of Cantor's construction. An example of how to prove this is given in {{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=822}}. Cantor's diagonal argument provides an accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; after ''n'' real algebraic numbers have been calculated because each of these numbers generates one digit of the transcendental number.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1994|p=824}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historians of mathematics have discovered the following facts about Cantor's article "On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers":

* Cantor's uncountability theorem was left out of the article he submitted. He added it during [[Galley proof|proofreading]].&lt;ref name=Ferreiros184&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The proof of Cantor's second theorem came from Dedekind. However, it omits Dedekind's explanation of why the limits ''a''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dauben|1979|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cantor restricted his first theorem to the set of real algebraic numbers. The proof he was using demonstrates the countability of the set of all algebraic numbers.&lt;ref name=Noether18 /&gt;

To explain these facts, historians have pointed to the influence of Cantor's former professors, [[Karl Weierstrass]] and Leopold Kronecker. Cantor discussed his results with Weierstrass on December 23, 1873.&lt;ref name=Noether16_17&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|pp=16&amp;ndash;17}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=847}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Weierstrass was first amazed by the concept of countability, but then found the countability of the set of real algebraic numbers useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1971|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor did not want to publish yet, but Weierstrass felt that he must publish at least his results concerning the algebraic numbers.&lt;ref name=Noether16_17 /&gt;

From his correspondence, it appears that Cantor only discussed his article with Weierstrass. However, Cantor told Dedekind: "The restriction which I have imposed on the published version of my investigations is caused in part by local circumstances …"&lt;ref name=Noether16_17 /&gt; Cantor biographer [[Joseph Dauben]] believes that "local circumstances" refers to Kronecker who, as a member of the editorial board of ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'', had delayed publication of an 1870 article by [[Eduard Heine]], one of Cantor's colleagues. Cantor would submit his article to ''Crelle's Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dauben|1979|pp=67, 308&amp;ndash;309}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weierstrass advised Cantor to leave his uncountability theorem out of the article he submitted, but Weierstrass also told Cantor that he could add it as a marginal note during proofreading, which he did.&lt;ref name=Ferreiros184 /&gt; It appears in a remark at the end of the article's introduction.&lt;ref&gt;See "[[#The article|The article]]" section. Also: {{harvnb|Cantor|1874|p=259}}; English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=841}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of Kronecker and Weierstrass both played a role here. Kronecker did not accept infinite sets, and it seems that Weierstrass did not accept that two infinite sets could be so different, with one being countable and the other not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=184&amp;ndash;185, 245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Weierstrass changed his opinion later.&lt;ref&gt;"It is unclear when his attitude changed, but there is evidence that by the mid-1880s he was accepting the conclusion that infinite sets are of different powers [cardinalities]." {{harv|Ferreirós|2007|p=185.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the uncountability theorem, the article needed a title that did not refer to this theorem. Cantor chose ''Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen''&lt;!-- Spelled "Ueber", not "Über", in the title, despite the standard use of umlauts in the text of the article. --&gt; ("On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers"), which refers to the countability of the set of real algebraic numbers, the result that Weierstrass found useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kronecker's influence appears in the proof of Cantor's second theorem. Cantor used Dedekind's version of the proof except he left out why the limits ''a''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and 
''b''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' exist. Dedekind had used his "principle of continuity" to prove they exist. This principle (which is equivalent to the [[least upper bound property]] of the real numbers) comes from Dedekind's construction of the real numbers, a construction Kronecker did not accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dauben|1979|pp=67&amp;ndash;68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor restricted his first theorem to the set of real algebraic numbers even though Dedekind had sent him a proof that handled all algebraic numbers.&lt;ref name=Noether18 /&gt; Cantor did this for expository reasons and because of "local circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction simplifies the article because the second theorem works with real sequences. Hence, the construction in the second theorem can be applied directly to the enumeration of the real algebraic numbers to produce "an effective procedure for the calculation of transcendental numbers." This procedure would be acceptable to Weierstrass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dedekind's contributions to Cantor's article==
[[File:Dedekind.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.93|Richard Dedekind, c. 1870.]]

Since 1856, Dedekind had developed theories involving infinitely many infinite sets—for example: [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, which he used in [[algebraic number theory]], and [[Dedekind cut]]s, which he used to construct the real numbers. This work enabled him to understand and contribute to Cantor's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=109&amp;ndash;111, 172&amp;ndash;174.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedekind's first contribution concerns the theorem that the set of real algebraic numbers is countable. Cantor is usually given credit for this theorem, but the mathematical historian José Ferreirós calls it "Dedekind's theorem."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|1993|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their correspondence reveals what each mathematician contributed to the theorem.

In his letter introducing the concept of countability, Cantor stated without proof that the set of positive rational numbers is countable, as are sets of the form (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n&lt;sub&gt;ν''&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''ν'' are positive integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=844}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's second result uses indexed numbers: a set of the form (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) is the range of a function from the ''ν'' indices to the set of real numbers. His second result implies his first: let ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The function can be quite general—for example, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|({{sfrac|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}})}}&lt;sup&gt;{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{nowrap|tan({{sfrac|''n''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}).}}

Dedekind replied with a proof of the theorem that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable.&lt;ref name=Noether18 /&gt; To obtain this result from Cantor's theorem about indexed numbers, Dedekind had to remove the restriction to positive integer indices and realize that the ordering produced can order the polynomials that have integer coefficients.

In his reply, Cantor did not claim to have proved Dedekind's result. He did indicate how he proved his theorem about indexed numbers: "Your proof that (''n'') [the set of positive integers] can be correlated one-to-one with the field of all algebraic numbers is approximately the same as the way I prove my contention in the last letter. I take ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;···&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{N}&lt;/math&gt; and order the elements accordingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|p=13}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|p=845}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor's ordering cannot handle indices that are 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedekind's second contribution is his proof of Cantor's second theorem. Dedekind sent Cantor this proof in reply to Cantor's letter that announced the uncountability theorem and proved it using infinitely many sequences. Before Dedekind's proof arrived, Cantor wrote that he had found a simpler proof that did not use infinitely many sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|Cavaillès|1937|pp=14&amp;ndash;16, 19}}. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|pp=845&amp;ndash;847, 849}}.&lt;/ref&gt; So Cantor had a choice of proofs and chose to publish Dedekind's.

Cantor thanked Dedekind privately for his help: "… your comments (which I value highly) and your manner of putting some of the points were of great assistance to me."&lt;ref name=Noether16_17 /&gt; However, he did not mention Dedekind's help in his article. In previous articles, he had acknowledged help received from Kronecker, Weierstrass, Heine, and [[Hermann Schwarz]]. Cantor's failure to mention Dedekind's contributions damaged his relationship with Dedekind. Dedekind stopped replying to his letters and did not resume the correspondence until October 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|1993|pp=349&amp;ndash;350}}; {{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=185&amp;ndash;186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legacy of Cantor's article==
Cantor's article introduced the uncountability theorem and the concept of countability. Both would lead to significant developments in mathematics. The uncountability theorem demonstrated that one-to-one correspondences can be used to analyze infinite sets. In 1878, Cantor used them to define and compare cardinalities. He also constructed one-to-one correspondences to prove that the [[n-dimensional Euclidean space|''n''-dimensional spaces]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (where '''R''' is the set of real numbers) and the set of irrational numbers have the same cardinality as '''R'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1878|pp=245&amp;ndash;254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Cantor's method of constructing a one-to-one correspondence between the set of irrational numbers and '''R''' can be used to construct one between the set of transcendental numbers and '''R'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1879|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction begins with the set of transcendental numbers ''T'' and removes a countable [[subset]] {''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for example, {{nowrap|''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''|''n''}}}}). Let this set be ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''T''&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t''&lt;sub&gt;{{nowrap|2''n'' – 1}}&lt;/sub&gt;}&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}, and '''R'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sequence of real algebraic numbers. So both ''T'' and '''R''' are the union of three pairwise disjoint sets: ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and two countable sets. A one-to-one correspondence between ''T'' and '''R''' is given by the function: {{nowrap|''g''(''t'') {{=}} ''t''}} if ''t''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|''g''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n'' – 1&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and {{nowrap|''g''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp; {{=}} ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.}}}}

In 1883, Cantor extended the [[natural numbers]] with his infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]]. This extension was necessary for his work on the [[Cantor–Bendixson theorem]]. Cantor discovered other uses for the ordinals—for example, he used sets of ordinals to produce an infinity of sets having different infinite cardinalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=267&amp;ndash;273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His work on infinite sets together with Dedekind's set-theoretical work created set theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=xvi, 320&amp;ndash;321, 324}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of countability led to countable operations and objects that are used in various areas of mathematics. For example, in 1878, Cantor introduced countable [[Union (set theory)|union]]s of sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1878|p=243}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, [[Émile Borel]] used countable unions in his [[Borel measure|theory of measure]], and [[René-Louis Baire|René Baire]] used countable ordinals to define his [[Baire function|classes of functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawkins|1970|pp=103&amp;ndash;106, 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the work of Borel and Baire, [[Henri Lebesgue]] created his theories of [[Lebesgue measure|measure]] and [[Lebesgue integration|integration]], which were published from 1899 to 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawkins|1970|pp=118, 120&amp;ndash;124, 127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Countable [[Model theory|models]] are used in set theory. In 1922, [[Thoralf Skolem]] proved that if conventional [[Set theory#Axiomatic set theory|axioms of set theory]] are [[consistent]], then they have a countable model. Since this model is countable, its set of real numbers is countable. This consequence is called [[Skolem's paradox]], and Skolem explained why it does not contradict Cantor's uncountability theorem: although there is a one-to-one correspondence between this set and the set of positive integers, no such one-to-one correspondence is a member of the model. Thus the model considers its set of real numbers to be uncountable, or more precisely, the [[first-order logic|first-order sentence]] that says the set of real numbers is uncountable is true within the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pp=362&amp;ndash;363}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, [[Paul Cohen]] used countable models to prove his [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independence]] theorems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohen|1963|pp=1143&amp;ndash;1144}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the term “'''graded'''” has a number of meanings, mostly related:

In [[abstract algebra]], it refers to a family of concepts:
* An [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-'''graded''' for an index set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; if it has a '''gradation''' or '''grading''', i.e. a decomposition into a direct sum &lt;math&gt;X = \oplus_{i \in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt; of structures; the elements of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; are said to be “'''homogeneous''' of '''degree''' ''i''”.
** The index set I is most commonly &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, and may be required to have extra structure depending on the type of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
** Grading by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) is also important.
** The '''trivial''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;- or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;-) gradation has &lt;math&gt;X_0 = X, X_i = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and a suitable trivial structure &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
** An algebraic structure is said to be [[doubly graded]] if the index set is a direct product of sets; the pairs may be called “'''bidegrees'''” (e.g. see [[spectral sequence]]).
* A &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;-[[graded vector space]] or '''graded linear space''' is thus a vector space with a decomposition into a direct sum &lt;math&gt;V = \oplus_{i \in I} V_i&lt;/math&gt; of spaces.
** A [[graded linear map]] is a map between graded vector spaces respecting their gradations.
* A [[graded ring]] is a ring that is a direct sum of abelian groups &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R_i R_j \subseteq R_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; taken from some monoid, usually &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, or semigroup (for a ring without identity).
** The [[associated graded ring]] of a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a proper ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gr}_I R = \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I^n/I^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* A [[graded module]] is left module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; over a graded ring which is a direct sum &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{i \in I} M_i&lt;/math&gt; of modules satisfying &lt;math&gt;R_i M_j \subseteq M_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt;.
** The [[associated graded module]] of an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a proper ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gr}_I M = \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I^n M/ I^{n+1} M&lt;/math&gt;.
** A [[differential graded module]]&lt;!-- see [[differential graded category]] --&gt;, '''differential graded &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-module''' or '''DG-module''' is a graded module &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with a '''differential''' &lt;math&gt;d\colon M \to M \colon M_i \to M_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; making &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a '''chain complex''', i.e. &lt;math&gt;d \circ d=0&lt;/math&gt; .
* A [[graded algebra]] is an algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that is graded as a ring; if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is graded we also require &lt;math&gt;A_iR_j \subseteq A_{i+j} \supseteq  R_iA_j&lt;/math&gt;.
** The [[graded Leibniz rule]] for a map &lt;math&gt;d\colon A \to A&lt;/math&gt; on a graded algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; specifies that &lt;math&gt;d(a \cdot b) = (da) \cdot b + (-1)^{|a|}a \cdot (db)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!-- ¿ , where &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the “parity” of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; ? --&gt;.
** A [[differential graded algebra]], '''DG-algebra''' or '''DGAlgebra''' is a graded algebra which is a differential graded module whose differential obeys the graded Leibniz rule.
** A [[homogeneous derivation]] on a graded algebra ''A'' is a homogeneous linear map of grade ''d'' = |''D''| on ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;D(ab)=D(a)b+\varepsilon^{|a||D|}aD(b), \varepsilon = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt; acting on homogeneous elements of ''A''.
** A [[Derivation (abstract algebra)#Graded derivations|graded derivation]] &lt;!-- [[Graded derivation]] redirects to [[Differential algebra]], which says nothing about it --&gt; is a sum of homogeneous derivations with the same &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
** A '''DGA''' is an augmented DG-algebra, or '''[[differential graded augmented algebra]]''', (see [[differential graded algebra]]).
** A [[superalgebra]] is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;-graded algebra.
*** A [[graded-commutative]] superalgebra satisfies the “supercommutative” law &lt;math&gt;yx = (-1)^{|x| |y|}xy.&lt;/math&gt; for homogeneous ''x'',''y'', where &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; represents the “parity” of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. 0 or 1 depending on the component in which it lies.
** '''CDGA''' may refer to the category of augmented differential graded commutative algebras.
* A [[graded Lie algebra]] is a Lie algebra which is graded as a vector space by a gradation compatible with its Lie bracket.
** A [[graded Lie superalgebra]] is a graded Lie algebra with the requirement for anticommutativity of its Lie bracket relaxed.
** A [[supergraded Lie superalgebra]] is a graded Lie superalgebra with an additional super &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;-gradation.
** A [[differential graded Lie algebra]] is a graded vector space over a field of characteristic zero together with a bilinear map &lt;math&gt;[,]: L_i \otimes L_j \to L_{i+j}&lt;/math&gt; and a differential &lt;math&gt;d: L_i \to L_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;[x,y] = (-1)^{|x||y|+1}[y,x],&lt;/math&gt; for any homogeneous elements ''x'', ''y'' in ''L'', the “graded Jacobi identity” and the graded Leibniz rule.
* The '''Graded Brauer group''' is a synonym for the [[Brauer–Wall group]] &lt;math&gt;BW(F)&lt;/math&gt; classifying finite-dimensional graded central division algebras over the field ''F''.
* An &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-[[graded category]] for a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; together with a functor &lt;math&gt;F:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

Early study of triangles can be traced to the [[2nd millennium BC]], in [[Egyptian mathematics]] ([[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]) and [[Babylonian mathematics]].
Systematic study of [[trigonometric]] functions began in [[Hellenistic mathematics]], reaching India as part of [[Hellenistic astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1998|loc=p. 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian astronomy]], the study of trigonometric functions flourished in the [[Gupta period]], especially due to [[Aryabhata]] (sixth century CE). During the Middle Ages, the study of trigonometry continued in [[Islamic mathematics]], hence it was adopted as a separate subject in the Latin West beginning in the [[Renaissance]] with [[Regiomontanus]].
The development of modern trigonometry shifted during the western [[Age of Enlightenment]], beginning with 17th-century mathematics ([[Isaac Newton]] and [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]]) and reaching its modern form with [[Leonhard Euler]] (1748).

==Etymology==
The term "trigonometry" was derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τρίγωνον|τρίγωνον]] ''trigōnon'', "triangle" and [[wikt:μέτρον|μέτρον]] ''metron'', "measure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trigonometry|title=trigonometry|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern word "sine" is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sinus'', which means "bay", "bosom" or "fold"
is indirectly, via Indian, Persian and Arabic transmission, derived from the Greek term ''[[Chord (geometry)|khordḗ]]'' "bow-string, chord". The Greek term was adopted into  [[Sanskrit]] as ''[[jyā]]''  "bow-string", later also in the variant ''[[jīvā]]''.
Sanskrit ''jīvā''  was rendered adopted into Arabic as ''jiba'', written ''jb'' جب.&lt;ref name="Boyer91-jiba"&gt;Boyer (1991), page 252: ''It was Robert of Chester's translation from the Arabic that resulted in our word "sine". The Hindus had given the name jiva to the half-chord in trigonometry, and the Arabs had taken this over as jiba. In the Arabic language there is also the word jaib meaning "bay" or "inlet". When Robert of Chester came to translate the technical word jiba, he seems to have confused this with the word jaib (perhaps because vowels were omitted); hence, he used the word sinus, the Latin word for "bay" or "inlet".''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maor-20"/&gt; &lt;!-- spelled with or without yod / ta marbouta? --&gt;
This   was then interpreted as the genuine Arabic  word ''jayb'', meaning  "bosom, fold, bay",&lt;ref name="Maor-20"/&gt; either by the Arabs or by a mistake of the European translators such as [[Robert of Chester]], who translated ''jayb'' into Latin as ''sinus''.&lt;ref name="Boyer91-jiba"/&gt; Particularly [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[sinus rectus arcus]]'' proved influential in establishing the term ''sinus''.&lt;ref name="oconnor1996"&gt;O'Connor (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The words "minute" and "second" are derived from the Latin phrases ''[[partes minutae primae]]'' and ''[[partes minutae secundae]]''.&lt;ref name="Boyer The 360-circle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer|first=Carl Benjamin |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |pages=166–167 |quote=It should be recalled that form the days of Hipparchus until modern times there were no such things as trigonometric ''ratios''. The Greeks, and after them the Hindus and the Arabs, used trigonometric ''lines''. These at first took the form, as we have seen, of chords in a circle, and it became incumbent upon Ptolemy to associate numerical values (or approximations) with the chords. [...] It is not unlikely that the 260-degree measure was carried over from astronomy, where the zodiac had been divided into twelve "signs" or 36 "decans". A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts. Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence. Moreover since the Babylonian position system for fractions was so obviously superior to the Egyptians unit fractions and the Greek common fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into sixty ''[[partes minutae primae]]'', each of these latter into sixty ''[[partes minutae secundae]]'', and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that translators used in this connection that our words "minute" and "second" have been derived. It undoubtedly was the sexagesimal system that led Ptolemy to subdivide the diameter of his trigonometric circle into 120 parts; each of these he further subdivided into sixty minutes and each minute of length sixty seconds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These roughly translate to "first small parts" and "second small parts".

==Development==

===Ancient Near East===
The ancient [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]]s and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]]s had known of theorems on the ratios of the sides of similar triangles for many centuries. However, as pre-Hellenic societies lacked the concept of an angle measure, they were limited to studying the sides of triangles instead.&lt;ref name="Boyer Early Trigonometry"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |pages=158–159 |quote=Trigonometry, like other branches of mathematics, was not the work of any one man, or nation. Theorems on ratios of the sides of similar triangles had been known to, and used by, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. In view of the pre-Hellenic lack of the concept of angle measure, such a study might better be called "trilaterometry", or the measure of three sided polygons (trilaterals), than "trigonometry", the measure of parts of a triangle. With the Greeks we first find a systematic study of relationships between angles (or arcs) in a circle and the lengths of chords subtending these. Properties of chords, as measures of central and inscribed angles in circles, were familiar to the Greeks of Hippocrates' day, and it is likely that Eudoxus had used ratios and angle measures in determining the size of the earth and the relative distances of the sun and the moon. In the works of Euclid there is no trigonometry in the strict sense of the word, but there are theorems equivalent to specific trigonometric laws or formulas. Propositions II.12 and 13 of the ''Elements'', for example, are the laws of cosines for obtuse and acute angles respectively, stated in geometric rather than trigonometric language and proved by a method similar to that used by Euclid in connection with the Pythagorean theorem. Theorems on the lengths of chords are essentially applications of the modern law of sines. We have seen that Archimedes' theorem on the broken chord can readily be translated into trigonometric language analogous to formulas for sines of sums and differences of angles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babylonian astronomer]]s kept detailed records on the rising and setting of [[star]]s, the motion of the [[planet]]s, and the solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, all of which required familiarity with [[Angle|angular]] distances measured on the [[celestial sphere]].&lt;ref name="Maor-20"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Trigonometric Delights |first=Eli |last=Maor |year=1998 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-09541-8 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on one interpretation of the [[Plimpton 322]] [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet (c. 1900 BC), some have even asserted that the ancient Babylonians had a table of secants.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph [[#joseph-2000b|(2000b, pp.383&amp;ndash;84)]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, much debate as to whether it is a table of [[Pythagorean triple]]s, a solution of quadratic equations, or a [[Generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric table]].

The Egyptians, on the other hand, used a primitive form of trigonometry for building [[pyramid]]s in the 2nd millennium BC.&lt;ref name="Maor-20"/&gt; The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]], written by the Egyptian scribe [[Ahmes]] (c. 1680–1620 BC), contains the following problem related to trigonometry:&lt;ref name="Maor-20"/&gt;

{{quote|"If a pyramid is 250 cubits high and the side of its base 360 cubits long, what is its ''[[seked]]''?"}}
Ahmes' solution to the problem is the ratio of half the side of the base of the pyramid to its height, or the run-to-rise ratio of its face. In other words, the quantity he found for the ''seked'' is the cotangent of the angle to the base of the pyramid and its face.&lt;ref name="Maor-20"/&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Trigonometric Chord.svg|left|thumb|200px|The chord of an angle subtends the arc of the angle.]]
Ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek and Hellenistic mathematician]]s made use of the [[chord (geometry)|chord]]. Given a circle and an arc on the circle, the chord is the line that subtends the arc. A chord's perpendicular bisector passes through the center of the circle and bisects the angle. One half of the bisected chord is the sine of one half the bisected angle, that is,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{chord}\ \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

and consequently the sine function is also known as the ''half-chord''. Due to this relationship, a number of trigonometric identities and theorems that are known today were also known to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] mathematicians, but in their equivalent chord form.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menelaus of Alexandria"/&gt;

Although there is no trigonometry in the works of [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]], in the strict sense of the word, there are theorems presented in a geometric way (rather than a trigonometric way) that are equivalent to specific trigonometric laws or formulas.&lt;ref name="Boyer Early Trigonometry"/&gt; For instance, propositions twelve and thirteen of book two of the ''Elements'' are the [[laws of cosines]] for obtuse and acute angles, respectively. Theorems on the lengths of chords are applications of the [[law of sines]]. And Archimedes' theorem on broken chords is equivalent to formulas for sines of sums and differences of angles.&lt;ref name="Boyer Early Trigonometry"/&gt; To compensate for the lack of a [[table of chords]], mathematicians of [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]' time would sometimes use the statement that, in modern notation, sin&amp;nbsp;''α''/sin&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''/''β''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;tan&amp;nbsp;''α''/tan&amp;nbsp;''β'' whenever 0°&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;90°, now known as [[Aristarchus's inequality]].&lt;ref name="Boyer Aristarchus of Samos"/&gt;

The first trigonometric table was apparently compiled by [[Hipparchus]] of [[İznik|Nicaea]] (180 – 125 BCE), who is now consequently known as "the father of trigonometry."&lt;ref name="Boyer Hipparchus of Nicaea quote"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |quote=For some two and a half centuries, from Hippocrates to Eratosthenes, Greek mathematicians had studied relationships between lines and circles and had applied these in a variety of astronomical problems, but no systematic trigonometry had resulted. Then, presumably during the second half of the 2nd century BC, the first trigonometric table apparently was compiled by the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 180–ca. 125 BC), who thus earned the right to be known as "the father of trigonometry". Aristarchus had known that in a given circle the ratio of arc to chord decreases as the arc decreases from 180° to 0°, tending toward a limit of 1. However, it appears that not until Hipparchus undertook the task had anyone tabulated corresponding values of arc and chord for a whole series of angles. |page=162 |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipparchus was the first to tabulate the corresponding values of arc and chord for a series of angles.&lt;ref name="oconnor1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer Hipparchus of Nicaea quote"/&gt;

Although it is not known when the systematic use of the 360° circle came into mathematics, it is known that the systematic introduction of the 360° circle came a little after [[Aristarchus of Samos]] composed ''[[On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'' (ca. 260 BC), since he measured an angle in terms of a fraction of a quadrant.&lt;ref name="Boyer Aristarchus of Samos"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |page=159 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |quote=Instead we have an treatise, perhaps composed earlier (ca. 260 BC), ''On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon'', which assumes a geocentric universe. In this work Aristarchus made the observation that when the moon is just half-full, the angle between the lines of sight to the sun and the moon is less than a right angle by one thirtieth of a quadrant. (The systematic introduction of the 360° circle came a little later. In trigonometric language of today this would mean that the ratio of the distance of the moon to that of the sun (the ration ME to SE in Fig. 10.1) is sin(3°). Trigonometric tables not having been developed yet, Aristarchus fell back upon a well-known geometric theorem of the time which now would be expressed in the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] sin&amp;nbsp;α/&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;β&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α/β&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;tan&amp;nbsp;α/&amp;nbsp;tan&amp;nbsp;β, for 0°&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;β&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;90°.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the systematic use of the 360° circle is largely due to Hipparchus and his [[table of chords]].  Hipparchus may have taken the idea of this division from [[Hypsicles]] who had earlier divided the day into 360 parts, a division of the day that may have been suggested by Babylonian astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |page=162 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |quote=It is not known just when the systematic use of the 360° circle came into mathematics, but it seems to be due largely to Hipparchus in connection with his table of chords.

A seasonal cycle of roughly 360 days could have corresponded to the signs and decans of the zodiac by dividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts.&lt;ref name="Boyer The 360-circle"/&gt; It is due to the Babylonian [[sexagesimal]] [[numeral system]] that each degree is divided into sixty minutes and each minute is divided into sixty seconds.&lt;ref name="Boyer The 360-circle"/&gt;

[[File:Menelaus-thm.png|thumb|left|200 px|[[Menelaus' theorem]]]]
[[Menelaus of Alexandria]] (ca. 100 AD) wrote in three books his ''Sphaerica''. In Book I, he established a basis for spherical triangles analogous to the Euclidean basis for plane triangles.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menelaus of Alexandria"/&gt; He establishes a theorem that is without Euclidean analogue, that two spherical triangles are congruent if corresponding angles are equal, but he did not distinguish between congruent and symmetric spherical triangles.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menelaus of Alexandria"/&gt; Another theorem that he establishes is that the sum of the angles of a spherical triangle is greater than 180°.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menelaus of Alexandria"/&gt; Book II of ''Sphaerica'' applies spherical geometry to astronomy. And Book III contains the "theorem of Menelaus".&lt;ref name="Boyer Menelaus of Alexandria"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |year=1991 |page=163 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |quote=In Book I of this treatise Menelaus establishes a basis for spherical triangles analogous to that of Euclid I for plane triangles.

The second book of the ''Sphaerica'' describes the application of spherical geometry to astronomical phenomena and is of little mathematical interest. Book III, the last, contains the well known "theorem of Menelaus" as part of what is essentially spherical trigonometry in the typical Greek form – a geometry or trigonometry of chords in a circle. In the circle in Fig. 10.4 we should write that chord AB is twice the sine of half the central angle AOB (multiplied by the radius of the circle). Menelaus and his Greek successors instead referred to AB simply as the chord corresponding to the arc AB. If BOB' is a diameter of the circle, then chord A' is twice the cosine of half the angle AOB (multiplied by the radius of the circle).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further gave his famous "rule of six quantities".&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 108"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (ca. 90 – ca. 168 AD) expanded upon Hipparchus' ''Chords in a Circle'' in his ''[[Almagest]]'', or the ''Mathematical Syntaxis''.  The Almagest is primarily a work on astronomy, and astronomy relies on trigonometry. [[Ptolemy's table of chords]] gives the lengths of chords of a circle of diameter 120 as a function of the number of degrees&amp;nbsp;''n'' in the corresponding arc of the circle, for ''n'' ranging from 1/2 to 180 by increments of&amp;nbsp;1/2.&lt;ref name=toomer&gt;

Toomer |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-691-00260-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteen books of the ''Almagest'' are the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all antiquity.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ptolemy"/&gt; A theorem that was central to Ptolemy's calculation of chords was what is still known today as [[Ptolemy's theorem]], that the sum of the products of the opposite sides of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] is equal to the product of the diagonals.  A special case of Ptolemy's theorem appeared as proposition 93 in Euclid's ''Data''.  Ptolemy's theorem leads to the equivalent of the four sum-and-difference formulas for sine and cosine that are today known as Ptolemy's formulas, although Ptolemy himself used chords instead of sine and cosine.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ptolemy"/&gt; Ptolemy further derived the equivalent of the half-angle formula

: &lt;math&gt;\sin^2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyer Ptolemy"/&gt;

Ptolemy used these results to create his trigonometric tables, but whether these tables were derived from Hipparchus' work cannot be determined.&lt;ref name="Boyer Ptolemy"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl Benjamin |last=Boyer |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title= |year=1991 |chapter=Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration |pages=164–166 |quote=The theorem of Menelaus played a fundamental role in spherical trigonometry and astronomy, but by far the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all antiquity was composed by Ptolemy of Alexandria about half a century after Menelaus. [...] Of the life of the author we are as little informed as we are of that of the author of the Elements. We do not know when or where Euclid and Ptolemy were born. We know that Ptolemy made observations at Alexandria from AD. 127 to 151 and, therefore, assume that he was born at the end of the 1st century. Suidas, a writer who lived in the 10th century, reported that Ptolemy was alive under Marcus Aurelius (emperor from AD 161 to 180).&lt;BR&gt;Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' is presumed to be heavily indebted for its methods to the ''Chords in a Circle'' of Hipparchus, but the extent of the indebtedness cannot be reliably assessed. It is clear that in astronomy Ptolemy made use of the catalog of star positions bequeathed by Hipparchus, but whether or not Ptolemy's trigonometric tables were derived in large part from his distinguished predecessor cannot be determined. [...] Central to the calculation of Ptolemy's chords was a geometric proposition still known as "Ptolemy's theorem": [...] that is, the sum of the products of the opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the diagonals. [...] A special case of Ptolemy's theorem had appeared in Euclid's ''Data'' (Proposition 93): [...] Ptolemy's theorem, therefore, leads to the result sin(''α''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''β'') =&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''β''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''Β''. Similar reasoning leads to the formula [...] These four sum-and-difference formulas consequently are often known today as Ptolemy's formulas.&lt;BR&gt;It was the formula for sine of the difference – or, more accurately, chord of the difference – that Ptolemy found especially useful in building up his tables. Another formula that served him effectively was the equivalent of our half-angle formula.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the tables of Hipparchus nor those of Ptolemy have survived to the present day, although descriptions by other ancient authors leave little doubt that they once existed.&lt;ref name="boyer1991"&gt;Boyer, pp. 158&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian mathematics===
{{See also|l1=Indian Mathematics|Indian_mathematics|l2=Indian astronomy|Indian astronomy}}
Some of the early and very significant developments of trigonometry were in [[History of India|India]]. Influential works from the 4th–5th century, known as the [[Siddhanta]]s (of which there were five, the most important of which is the [[Surya Siddhanta]]&lt;ref&gt;Boyer (1991), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;) first defined the sine as the modern relationship between half an angle and half a chord, while also defining the cosine, [[versine]], and [[inverse sine]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer (1991), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon afterwards, another [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]] and [[Indian astronomy|astronomer]], [[Aryabhata]] (476&amp;ndash;550 AD), collected and expanded upon the developments of the Siddhantas in an important work called the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|1991|loc= p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Siddhantas'' and the ''Aryabhatiya''  contain the earliest surviving tables of sine values and [[versine]] (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;cosine) values, in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|1991|loc= p. 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the words ''[[jya]]'' for sine, ''[[kojya]]'' for cosine, ''[[utkrama-jya]]'' for versine, and ''otkram jya'' for inverse sine. The words ''[[jya]]'' and ''[[kojya]]'' eventually became ''sine'' and ''cosine'' respectively after a mistranslation described above.

In the 7th century, [[Bhaskara the First]] produced a formula for calculating the sine of an acute angle without the use of a table. He also gave the following approximation formula for sin(''x''), which had a relative error of less than&amp;nbsp;1.9%:

: &lt;math&gt;\sin x \approx \frac{16x (\pi - x)}{5 \pi^2 - 4x (\pi - x)}, \qquad \left(0\leq x\leq\pi\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Later in the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] redeveloped the formula

: &lt;math&gt;\ 1 - \sin^2(x) = \cos^2(x) = \sin^2\left (\frac{\pi}{2} - x\right )&lt;/math&gt;

(also derived earlier, as mentioned above) and the [[Brahmagupta interpolation formula]] for computing sine values.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph [[#joseph-2000a|(2000a, pp.285&amp;ndash;86)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhava of Sangamagrama|Madhava]] (c. 1400) made early strides in the [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] of trigonometric functions and their [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]] expansions. He developed the concepts of the [[power series]] and [[Taylor series]], and produced the [[Madhava series|power series]] expansions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent.&lt;ref name="Robertson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt; Using the Taylor series approximations of sine and cosine, he produced a sine table to 12 decimal places of accuracy and a cosine table to 9 decimal places of accuracy. He also gave the power series of [[Pi|π]] and the [[Theta|θ]], [[radius]], [[diameter]], and [[circumference]] of a circle in terms of trigonometric functions. His works were expanded by his followers at the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics|Kerala School]] up to the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;O'Connor and Robertson (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;Pearce (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese mathematics===
[[File:Guo Shoujing-beijing.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Guo Shoujing]] (1231&amp;ndash;1316)]]
In [[China]], [[Aryabhata]]'s table of sines were translated into the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematical]] book of the ''[[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era|Kaiyuan Zhanjing]]'', compiled in 718 AD during the [[Tang Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chinese excelled in other fields of mathematics such as solid geometry, [[binomial theorem]], and complex algebraic formulas, early forms of trigonometry were not as widely appreciated as in the earlier Greek, Hellenistic, Indian and Islamic worlds.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 108 109"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the early Chinese used an empirical substitute known as ''chong cha'', while practical use of plane trigonometry in using the sine, the tangent, and the secant were known.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"/&gt; However, this embryonic state of trigonometry in China slowly began to change and advance during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279), where Chinese mathematicians began to express greater emphasis for the need of spherical trigonometry in calendrical science and astronomical calculations.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"/&gt; The [[polymath]] Chinese scientist, mathematician and official [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095) used trigonometric functions to solve mathematical problems of chords and arcs.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"/&gt; Victor J. Katz writes that in Shen's formula "technique of intersecting circles", he created an approximation of the arc&amp;nbsp;''s'' of a circle given the diameter&amp;nbsp;''d'', [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]]&amp;nbsp;''v'', and length&amp;nbsp;''c'' of the chord subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as&lt;ref name="katz 308"&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|2007|loc=p. 308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;s = c + \frac{2v^2}{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

Sal Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for [[spherical trigonometry]] developed in the 13th century by the mathematician and astronomer [[Guo Shoujing]] (1231&amp;ndash;1316).&lt;ref name="restivo 32"&gt;Restivo, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; As the historians L. Gauchet and Joseph Needham state, Guo Shoujing used [[spherical trigonometry]] in his calculations to improve the [[Chinese calendar|calendar system]] and [[Chinese astronomy]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gauchet 151"&gt;Gauchet, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a later 17th-century Chinese illustration of Guo's mathematical proofs, Needham states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Guo used a quadrangular spherical pyramid, the basal quadrilateral of which consisted of one equatorial and one ecliptic arc, together with two [[meridian arc]]s, one of which passed through the [[summer solstice]] point...By such methods he was able to obtain the du lü (degrees of equator corresponding to degrees of ecliptic), the ji cha (values of chords for given ecliptic arcs), and the cha lü (difference between chords of arcs differing by 1 degree).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 109 110"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the achievements of Shen and Guo's work in trigonometry, another substantial work in Chinese trigonometry would not be published again until 1607, with the dual publication of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' by Chinese official and astronomer [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562&amp;ndash;1633) and the Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552&amp;ndash;1610).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 110"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|Page from ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'' by [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD 820)]]
Previous works were later translated and expanded in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] by [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Muslim mathematician]]s of mostly [[List of Iranian scientists and scholars|Persian]] and [[List of Arab scientists and scholars|Arab descent]], who enunciated a large number of theorems which freed the subject of trigonometry from dependence upon the complete [[quadrilateral]], as was the case in Hellenistic mathematics due to the application of [[Menelaus' theorem]]. According to E. S. Kennedy, it was after this development in Islamic mathematics that "the first real trigonometry emerged, in the sense that only then did the object of study become the [[Spherical trigonometry|spherical]] or plane [[triangle]], its sides and [[angle]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E. S. |last=Kennedy |title=The History of Trigonometry |journal=31st Yearbook |publisher=National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Washington DC |year=1969}} ([[cf.]] {{Cite journal |first=Syed Nomanul |last=Haq |title=The Indian and Persian background |pages=60–3}}, in {{Cite book |title=History of Islamic Philosophy |first=Oliver Leaman |last=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |author-link=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |year=1996 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-13159-6 |pages=52–70}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods dealing with spherical triangles were also known, particularly the method of [[Menelaus of Alexandria]], who developed "Menelaus' theorem" to deal with spherical problems.&lt;ref name="Boyer Menelaus of Alexandria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor |id=Menelaus |title=Menelaus of Alexandria}} "Book 3 deals with spherical trigonometry and includes Menelaus's theorem".&lt;/ref&gt; However, E. S. Kennedy points out that while it was possible in pre-Islamic mathematics to compute the magnitudes of a spherical figure, in principle, by use of the table of chords and Menelaus' theorem, the application of the theorem to spherical problems was very difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E.

It involved setting up two intersecting [[right triangle]]s; by applying Menelaus' theorem it was possible to solve one of the six sides, but only if the other five sides were known. To tell the time from the [[sun]]'s [[altitude]], for instance, repeated applications of Menelaus' theorem were required. For medieval [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomers]], there was an obvious challenge to find a simpler trigonometric method.&lt;ref name=Gingerich&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gingerich |first=Owen |date=April 1986 |url=http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/PHYS/alshukri/PHYS215/Islamic_astronomy.htm |title=Islamic astronomy |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=254 |issue=10 |page=74 |accessdate=2008-05-18 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0486-74 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101211150/http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/PHYS/alshukri/PHYS215/Islamic_astronomy.htm |archivedate=2011-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 9th century AD, [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] produced accurate sine and cosine tables, and the first table of tangents. He was also a pioneer in [[spherical trigonometry]]. In 830 AD, [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]] produced the first table of cotangents.&lt;ref name="Sesiano"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albatenius) (853-929 AD) discovered the reciprocal functions of secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1° to 90°.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

By the 10th century AD, in the work of [[Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī]], Muslim mathematicians were using all six [[trigonometric functions]].&lt;ref name="Boyer238"&gt;Boyer (1991) p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Abu al-Wafa had sine tables in 0.25° increments, to 8 decimal places of accuracy, and accurate tables of tangent values.&lt;ref name="Boyer238"/&gt; He also developed the following trigonometric formula:&lt;ref name="musa"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moussa |first=Ali |title=Mathematical Methods in Abū al-Wafāʾ's Almagest and the Qibla Determinations |journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy |year=2011 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=1–56 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.1017/S095742391000007X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \sin(2x) = 2 \sin(x) \cos(x) &lt;/math&gt; (a special case of Ptolemy's angle-addition formula; see above)

In his original text, Abū al-Wafā' states: "If we want that, we multiply the given sine by the cosine [[minute of arc|minutes]], and the result is half the sine of the double".&lt;ref name="musa" /&gt; Abū al-Wafā also established the angle addition and difference identities presented with complete proofs:&lt;ref name="musa" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\alpha \pm \beta) = \sqrt{\sin^2 \alpha - (\sin \alpha \sin \beta)^2} \pm \sqrt{\sin^2 \beta- (\sin \alpha\sin \beta)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\alpha \pm \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta \pm \cos \alpha \sin \beta &lt;/math&gt;

For the second one, the text states: "We multiply the sine of each of the two arcs by the cosine of the other ''minutes''. If we want the sine of the sum, we add the products, if we want the sine of the difference, we take their difference".&lt;ref name="musa" /&gt;

He also discovered the [[Law of sines#Curvature|law of sines]] for spherical trigonometry:&lt;ref name="Sesiano"&gt;Jacques Sesiano, "Islamic mathematics", p. 157, in {{Cite book |title=Mathematics Across Cultures: The History of Non-western Mathematics |editor1-first=Helaine |editor1-last=Selin |editor1-link=Helaine Selin |editor2-first=Ubiratan |editor2-last=D'Ambrosio |editor2-link=Ubiratan D'Ambrosio |year=2000 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=1-4020-0260-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin A}{\sin a} = \frac{\sin B}{\sin b} = \frac{\sin C}{\sin c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also in the late 10th and early 11th centuries AD, the Egyptian astronomer [[Ibn Yunus]] performed many careful trigonometric calculations and demonstrated the following [[trigonometric identity]]:&lt;ref&gt;William Charles Brice, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=6DYVAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA413&amp;pg=PA413 An Historical atlas of Islam]', p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos a \cos b = \frac{\cos(a+b) + \cos(a-b)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Al-Jayyani]] (989&amp;ndash;1079) of [[al-Andalus]] wrote ''The book of unknown arcs of a sphere'', which is considered "the first treatise on [[spherical trigonometry]]".&lt;ref name="MacTutor Al-Jayyani"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Jayyani|title=Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muadh Al-Jayyani}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "contains formulae for [[Special right triangles|right-handed triangles]], the general law of sines, and the solution of a [[spherical triangle]] by means of the polar triangle." This treatise later had a "strong influence on European mathematics", and his "definition of [[ratio]]s as numbers" and "method of solving a spherical triangle when all sides are unknown" are likely to have influenced [[Regiomontanus]].&lt;ref name="MacTutor Al-Jayyani"/&gt;

The method of [[triangulation]] was first developed by Muslim mathematicians, who applied it to practical uses such as [[surveying]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1996), "Engineering", in Roshdi Rashed, ''Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science'', Vol. 3, p. 751–795 [769].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Islamic geography]], as described by [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] in the early 11th century. Biruni himself introduced triangulation techniques to [[Abu Rayhan Biruni#Geodesy and geography|measure the size of the Earth]] and the distances between various places.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyám]] (1048&amp;ndash;1131) solved [[cubic equation]]s using approximate numerical solutions found by interpolation in trigonometric tables. In the 13th century, [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] was the first to treat trigonometry as a mathematical discipline independent from astronomy, and he developed spherical trigonometry into its present form.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |title=trigonometry |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605281/trigonometry |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He listed the six distinct cases of a right-angled triangle in spherical trigonometry, and in his ''On the Sector Figure'', he stated the law of sines for plane and spherical triangles, discovered the [[law of tangents]] for spherical triangles, and provided proofs for both these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.

In 1342, Levi ben Gershon, known as [[Gersonides]], wrote ''On Sines, Chords and Arcs'', in particular proving the [[sine law]] for plane triangles and giving five-figure [[sine table]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Shai |last=Simonson |format=PDF |title=The Mathematics of Levi ben Gershon, the Ralbag |url=http://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/Shai_papers/MathofLevi.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified trigonometric table, the "''[[toleta de marteloio]]''", was used by sailors in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the 14th-15th Centuries to calculate [[navigation]] courses.  It is described by [[Ramon Llull]] of [[Majorca]] in 1295, and laid out in the 1436 atlas of [[Venice|Venetian]] captain [[Andrea Bianco]].

In the 15th century, [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] provided the first explicit statement of the [[law of cosines]] in a form suitable for [[triangulation]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In [[France]], the law of cosines is still referred to as the ''[[:fr:Théorème d'Al-Kashi|theorem of Al-Kashi]]''. He also gave trigonometric tables of values of the sine function to four [[sexagesimal]] digits (equivalent to 8 decimal places) for each 1° of argument with differences to be added for each 1/60 of&amp;nbsp;1°.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Ulugh Beg]] also gives accurate tables of sines and tangents correct to 8 decimal places around the same time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Early modern mathematics===
[[Regiomontanus]] was perhaps the first mathematician in Europe to treat trigonometry as a distinct mathematical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''De triangulis omnimodis'' written in 1464, as well as his later ''Tabulae directionum'' which included the tangent function, unnamed.
The ''Opus palatinum de triangulis'' of [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], a student of [[Copernicus]], was probably the first in Europe to define trigonometric functions directly in terms of right triangles instead of circles, with tables for all six trigonometric functions; this work was finished by Rheticus' student [[Valentinus Otho|Valentin Otho]] in 1596.

In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton]] and [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]] developed the general Newton–Stirling interpolation formula for trigonometric functions.

In the 18th century, [[Leonhard Euler]]'s ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum'' (1748) was mostly responsible for establishing the analytic treatment of trigonometric functions in Europe, deriving their infinite series and presenting "[[Euler's formula]]"&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;''x''.  Euler used the near-modern abbreviations ''sin.'', ''cos.'', ''tang.'', ''cot.'', ''sec.'', and ''cosec.'' Prior to this, [[Roger Cotes]] had computed the derivative of sine in his ''Harmonia Mensurarum'' (1722).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0315086087900644 The calculus of the trigonometric functions]", Historia Mathematica Volume 14, Issue 4, November 1987, Pages 311–324, by Victor J. Katz doi 10.1016/0315-0860(87)90064-4, the proof of Cotes is mentioned on p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in the 18th century, [[Brook Taylor]] defined the general Taylor series and gave the series expansions and approximations for all six trigonometric functions. The works of [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] in the 17th century and [[Colin Maclaurin]] in the 18th century were also very influential in the development of trigonometric series.

"'''Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon'''" ("In [[Ashkelon]]'s Black Whale") is a popular academic [[commercium song]]. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many German speaking ancient universities. [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] provided the lyrics under the title '''''Altassyrisch''''' ([[Assyria|Old Assyrian]]) 1854, the melody is from 1783 or earlier&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lieder-archiv.de/im_schwarzen_walfisch_zu_askalon-notenblatt_600700.html Lieder-Archiv (de) (Song Archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Content ==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the [[bacchanalia]]n mayhem of student life, similar as in [[Gaudeamus igitur]]. The song describes an [[Assyria|old Assyrian]] [[drinking binge]] of a man in an inn with some references to the [[Classics]]. The desks are made of marble and the large invoice is being provided in [[cuneiform]] on bricks. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineveh. A Nubian house servant kicks him out then and the song closes with the notion, that (compare John 4:44) a prophet has no honor in his own country, if he doesn't pay cash for his consumption.  [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] has translated the poems among other works of Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], Gaudeamus! Humorous Poems by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35848?msg=welcome_stranger#bibrec Ebook-Nr. 35848 on gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Each stanza begins with the naming verse "Im Schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon", but varies the outcome. The "Im" is rather prolonged with the melody and increases the impact. Some of the stanzas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
Da trank ein Mann drei Tag',
&lt;br&gt;
Bis dass er steif wie ein Besenstiel
&lt;br&gt;
Am Marmortische lag.
&lt;br&gt;

'In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
A man drank day by day,
&lt;br&gt;
Till, stiff as any broom-handle,
&lt;br&gt;
Upon the floor he lay.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
The waiters brought the bill,
&lt;br&gt;
In arrow-heads on six broad tiles
&lt;br&gt;
To him who thus did swill.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
No prophet hath renown;
&lt;br&gt;
And he who there would drink in peace
&lt;br&gt;
Must pay the money down.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to German Poetry: A Dual-Language Book, Gustave Mathieu, Guy Stern Courier Dover Publications, 31.05.2012, including as well a translation 
&lt;/ref&gt; as e.g. [[Historical criticism]] and interpretations of the [[Book of Jonah]] as a mere shipwrecking narrative. According to Scheffel, the guest didn't try to get back in the inn as „Aussi bini, aussi bleibi, wai Ascalun, ihr grobi Kaibi“ (I been out, I stay so, you rude Aschkelon calves). There are various additional verses, including political parodist ones and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities.
The song has been used as name for traditional inns and restaurants, e.g. in Heidelberg and [[Bad Säckingen]]. In Bad Säckingen the name was used on several (consecutive) inns and was namegiver for the still existing club "Walfisch Gesellschaft Säckingen" (Walfischia), honoring Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotel-restaurant-schwarzer-walfisch.de/de/geschichte.html Hotel-Restaurant “Zum Schwarzen Walfisch” Bad Säckingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Plato, there was writt'n: &lt;br&gt;
“To each non-mathematicus &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same stanza is available in further 13 languages, including Greek (Μελαίνῃ τῇ ἐν Φαλαίνᾳ - Melaínē (black) tē (the) en (in) Phalaína (whale)) and Volapük, which are sung one after the other.

[[File:hyperbola E.svg|thumb|right|[[Euler's number]] '''e''' corresponds to shaded area equal to 1, introduced in chapter VII]]
'''''Introductio in analysin infinitorum''''' ('''''Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite''''') is a two-volume work by [[Leonhard Euler]] which lays the foundations of [[mathematical analysis]]. Written in [[Latin]] and published in 1748, the ''Introductio'' contains 18 chapters in the first part and 22 chapters in the second. It has [[Eneström index|Eneström numbers]] E101 and E102.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E101.html|title=E101 -- Introductio in analysin infinitorum, volume 1|last=|first=|date=|website=The Euler Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E102.html|title=E102 -- Introductio in analysin infinitorum, volume 2|last=|first=|date=|website=The Euler Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Carl Boyer]]'s lectures at the 1950 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] compared the influence of  Euler's ''Introductio'' to that of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', calling the ''Elements'' the foremost textbook of ancient times, and the ''Introductio'' "the foremost textbook of modern times".&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Carl Boyer]] |title=The Foremost Textbook of Modern Times| volume= 58| issue= 4|date=April 1951|pages= 223–226 |format= |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |accessdate= |doi=10.2307/2306956 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America|jstor=2306956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer also wrote:
:The analysis of Euler comes close to the modern orthodox discipline, the study of functions by means of infinite processes, especially through infinite series.
:It is doubtful that any other essentially didactic work includes as large a portion of original material that survives in the college courses today...Can be read with comparative ease by the modern student...The prototype of modern textbooks.

The first translation into English was that by John D. Blanton, published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=1988 | title = Introduction to analysis of the infinite, Book 1 | author1=Leonhard Euler | author2=J. D. Blanton (transl.) | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-387-96824-7 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=H58dmcLEnk4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, by Ian Bruce, is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/introductiontoanalysisvol1.htm ''Introductio in analysin infinitorum''.]&lt;/ref&gt; A list of the editions of ''Introductio'' has been assembled by [[V. Frederick Rickey]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Frederick Rickey [http://fredrickey.info/hm/Euler-Introductio.pdf  A Reader’s Guide to Euler’s Introductio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 1 is on the concepts of [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s and [[function (mathematics)|function]]s. Chapter 4 introduces [[infinite series]] through [[rational function]]s.

According to [[Henk Bos (historian)|Henk Bos]],
:The ''Introduction'' is meant as a survey of concepts and methods in analysis and analytic geometry preliminary to the study of the differential and integral calculus. [Euler] made of this survey a masterly exercise in introducing as much as possible of analysis without using differentiation or integration. In particular, he introduced the elementary transcendental functions, the logarithm, the exponential function, the trigonometric functions and their inverses without recourse to integral calculus — which was no mean feat, as the logarithm was traditionally linked to the quadrature of the hyperbola and the trigonometric functions to the arc-length of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. J. M. Bos]] (1980) "Newton, Leibnitz and the Leibnizian tradition", chapter 2, pages 49–93, quote page 76, in ''From the Calculus to Set Theory, 1630 – 1910: An Introductory History'', edited by [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]], [[Duckworth Overlook|Duckworth]] {{ISBN|0-7156-1295-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euler accomplished this feat by introducing [[exponentiation]] ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for arbitrary constant ''a'' in the [[positive real numbers]]. He noted that mapping ''x'' this way is ''not'' an [[algebraic function]], but rather a [[transcendental function]]. For ''a'' &gt; 1 these functions are monotonic increasing and form bijections of the real line with positive real numbers. Then each base ''a'' corresponds to an inverse function called the logarithm to base ''a'', in chapter 6. In chapter 7, Euler introduces e as the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is 1. The reference here is to [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] who performed a [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] of the hyperbola ''y'' = 1/''x'' through description of the hyperbolic logarithm. Section 122 labels the logarithm to base e the "natural or hyperbolic logarithm...since the quadrature of the hyperbola can be expressed through these logarithms".  Here he also gives the exponential series:
: &lt;math&gt;\exp(z) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} {z^k \over k!} = 1 + z + {z^2 \over 2} + {z^3 \over 6} + {z^4 \over 24} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Then in chapter 8 Euler is prepared to address the classical trigonometric functions as "transcendental quantities that arise from the circle." He uses the [[unit circle]] and presents [[Euler's formula]]. Chapter 9 considers trinomial factors in [[polynomial]]s. Chapter 16 is concerned with [[partition (number theory)|partition]]s, a topic in [[number theory]]. [[Continued fraction]]s are the topic of chapter 18.

The '''Ishango bone''' is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era.  It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a [[baboon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html |date=2008-07-21 }} [[University of Western Australia]] School of Mathematics - accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  with a sharp piece of [[quartz]] affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a [[tally stick]], as it has a series of what has been interpreted as [[tally marks]] carved in three columns running the length of the tool, though it has also been suggested that the scratches might have been to create a better grip on the handle or for some other non-mathematical reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|year=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ishango bone was found in 1960 by Belgian [[Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt]] while exploring what was then the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;de Heinzelin, Jean: "Ishango", ''[[Scientific American]]'', 206:6 (June 1962) 105--116.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was discovered in the area of [[Ishango]] near the [[Semliki River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Edward|url=http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-04-EN.html|website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Edward]] empties into the Semliki which forms part of the headwaters of the [[Nile River]] (now on the border between modern-day [[Uganda]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|D.R. Congo]]). The bone was found among the remains of a small community that fished and gathered in this area of Africa.  The settlement had been buried in a [[Volcano|volcanic eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott W.: "[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/ishango.html Mathematicians of the African Diaspora]" The Mathematics Department of The [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.

The artifact was first estimated to have originated between 9,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 6,500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes, Paulus (1991): [http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/AMU/amu_chma_09.html#beginnings On The History of Mathematics in Africa South of the Sahara]; [[African Mathematical Union]], Commission on the History of Mathematics in Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;  
However, the dating of the site where it was discovered was re-evaluated, and it is now believed to be more than 20,000 years old (between 18,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name=Marshack&gt;Marshack, Alexander (1991): ''The Roots of Civilization'', Colonial Hill, Mount Kisco, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks,  A.S. and Smith, C.C.

The Ishango bone is on permanent exhibition at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=RBINS_intro&gt;[https://www.naturalsciences.be/expo/old_ishango/en/ishango/introduction.html Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051733/https://www.naturalsciences.be/expo/old_ishango/en/ishango/introduction.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBINS_flash&gt;[http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-02-EN.html Flash presentation], [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;[http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-entity?identity=4&amp;idsubentity=1 The Ishango Bone, Democratic Republic of the Congo], on permanent display at the [[Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences]], Brussels, Belgium.

The etchings on the bone are in three columns with marks [[asymmetry|asymmetrically]] grouped into sets, leading to "various tantalizing hypotheses",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Numbers and the Making of Us: Counting and the Course of Human Cultures|first=Caleb|last=Everett|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780674504431|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2f1aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as that the implement was used as a counting tool for simple mathematical procedures or even to construct a [[numeral system]]. 

The third column has been interpreted as a "table of prime numbers",&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott W.: "Mathematicians of the African Diaspora" The Mathematics Department of The State University of New York at Buffalo.[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/ishango.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is more likely to be a coincidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historian of mathematics Peter S. Rudman argues that prime numbers were probably not understood until about 500 BC, and were dependent on the concept of division, which he dates to no earlier than 10,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|last=Rudman|first=Peter Strom|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59102-477-4|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alexander Marshack]] speculated that the Ishango bone represents a six-month [[lunar calendar]].&lt;ref name=Marshack /&gt; This has led [[Claudia Zaslavsky]] to suggest that the creator of the tool may have been a woman, tracking the [[lunar phase]] in relation to the [[menstrual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia: ''Africa Counts: Number and Pattern in African Culture'', L. Hill, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaslavsky, Claudia: "[http://web.nmsu.edu/~pscott/isgem71.htm Women as the First Mathematicians]", ''International Study Group on Ethnomathematics Newsletter'', Volume 7 Number 1, 1992|January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; This is countered with the argument that Marshack overinterprets the data and that the evidence does not support lunar calendars.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Judy. 1992.

==Second bone==
During earlier excavations at the Ishango site in 1959, another bone was also found. It is lighter in color and was scraped, thinned, polished, and broken on one end, revealing it to be hollow. The artifact possibly held a piece of quartz like the more well-known bone or it could have been a tool handle. The 14-cm long bone has 90 notches on six sides, which are categorized as "major" or "minor" according to their length. Jean de Heinzelin interpreted the major notches as being units or multiples and the minor notches as fractions or subsidiary. He believed the bone to be an "interchange rule between bases 10 and 12."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Second Bone|url=http://ishango.naturalsciences.be/Flash/flash_local/Ishango-24-EN.html|website=Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">In [[mathematics]], the '''Kleene&amp;ndash;Rosser paradox''' is a paradox that shows that certain systems of [[formal logic]] are [[inconsistent]], in particular the version of [[Haskell Curry|Curry]]'s [[combinatory logic]] introduced in 1930, and [[Alonzo Church|Church]]'s original [[lambda calculus]], introduced in 1932&amp;ndash;1933, both originally intended as systems of formal logic. The paradox was exhibited by [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]] in 1935.

==The paradox==
Kleene and Rosser were able to show that both systems are able to characterize and enumerate their provably total, definable number-theoretic functions, which enabled them to construct a term that essentially replicates the [[Richard paradox]] in formal language.

Curry later managed to identify the crucial ingredients of the calculi that allowed the construction of this paradox, and used this to construct a much simpler paradox, now known as [[Curry's paradox#Lambda calculus|Curry's paradox]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], specifically the philosophical foundations of [[set theory]], '''limitation of size''' is a concept developed by [[Philip Jourdain]] and/or [[Georg Cantor]] to avoid [[Cantor's paradox]]. It identifies certain "inconsistent multiplicities", in Cantor's terminology, that cannot be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] because they are "too large". In modern terminology these are called [[class (set theory)|proper classes]].

==Use==
The [[axiom of limitation of size]] is an axiom in some versions of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. This axiom says that any class which is not "too large" is a set, and a set cannot be "too large". "Too large" is defined as being large enough that the class of all sets can be mapped one-to-one into it.

== Mathematics ==
{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

A '''Macroscopic traffic flow model''' is a [[mathematical model|mathematical]] [[traffic model]] that formulates the relationships among [[traffic flow]] characteristics like [[density]], [[Traffic flow|flow]], mean speed of a traffic stream, etc.. Such models are conventionally arrived at by integrating [[microscopic traffic flow models]] and converting the single-entity level characteristics to comparable system level characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | doi=10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | volume=217 | issue=3 | title=Rigorous Derivation of Nonlinear Scalar Conservation Laws from Follow-the-Leader Type Models via Many Particle Limit | journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis | pages=831–871| year=2015 | last1=Di Francesco | first1=M. | last2=Rosini | first2=M.D. | arxiv=1404.7062 | bibcode=2015ArRMA.217..831D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of modeling traffic flow at macroscopic level originated under an assumption that traffic streams as a whole are comparable to [[fluid flow|fluid streams]]. The first major step in macroscopic modeling of traffic was taken by Lighthill and Whitham in 1955, when they indexed the comparability of ‘traffic flow on long crowded roads’ with ‘flood movements in long rivers’. A year later, Richards (1956) complemented the idea with the introduction of ‘[[shock-wave]]s on the highway’, completing the so-called LWR model. 
Macroscopic modeling may be primarily classified according to the type of traffic as homogeneous and heterogeneous, and further with respect to the order of the mathematical model.

'''Mathematical knowledge management (MKM)''' is the study of how society can effectively make use of the vast and growing literature on [[mathematics]]. It studies approaches such as [[database]]s of mathematical knowledge, automated processing of formulae and the use of [[semantic web|semantic information]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. Mathematics is particularly suited to a systematic study of automated knowledge processing due to the high degree of interconnectedness between different areas of mathematics.

A '''mathematician''' is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of [[mathematics]] in his or her work, typically to solve [[mathematical problem]]s.

Mathematics is concerned with [[number]]s, [[data]], [[quantity]], [[mathematical structure|structure]], [[space]], [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[mathematics#Change|change]].

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is on the history of mathematicians. For a history of mathematics in general, see [[History of mathematics]]}}

One of the earliest known mathematicians was [[Thales of Miletus]] (c. 624–c.546 BC); he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Boyer|year=1991|title=A History of Mathematics|page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]].

The number of known mathematicians grew when [[Pythagoras of Samos]] (c. 582–c. 507 BC) established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins.

The first woman mathematician recorded by history was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/hypatia.html Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

Science and mathematics in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. Funding for translation of scientific texts in other languages was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs,&lt;ref&gt;Abattouy, M., Renn, J. &amp; Weinig, P., 2001. Transmission as Transformation: The Translation Movements in the Medieval East and West in a Comparative Perspective. Science in Context, 14(1-2), 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. An example of a translator and mathematician who benefited from this type of support was [[al-Khawarizmi]]. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on [[optics]], [[Mathematics|maths]] and [[astronomy]] of [[Ibn al-Haytham]].

The [[Renaissance]] brought an increased emphasis on mathematics and science to Europe. During this period of transition from a mainly feudal and ecclesiastical culture to a predominantly secular one, many notable mathematicians had other occupations: [[Luca Pacioli]] (founder of [[accounting]]); [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] (notable engineer and bookkeeper); [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (earliest founder of probability and binomial expansion); [[Robert Recorde]] (physician) and [[François Viète]] (lawyer).

As time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities. An emphasis on free thinking and experimentation had begun in Britain's oldest universities beginning in the seventeenth century at Oxford with the scientists [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]], and at Cambridge where [[Isaac Newton]] was [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Professor of Mathematics &amp; Physics]]. Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the “regurgitation of knowledge” to “encourag[ing] productive thinking.”&lt;ref&gt;Röhrs, "The Classical Idea of the University," ''Tradition and Reform of the University under an International Perspective'' p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Humboldt convinced the King of Prussia to build a university in Berlin based on [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]’s liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge and to teach students to “take account of fundamental laws of science in all their thinking.” Thus, seminars and laboratories started to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

British universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the Italian and German universities, but as they already enjoyed substantial freedoms and [[autonomy]] the changes there had begun with the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the same influences that inspired Humboldt. The Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] emphasized the importance of [[research]], arguably more authentically implementing Humboldt’s idea of a university than even German universities, which were subject to state authority.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, science (including mathematics) became the focus of universities in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students could conduct research in [[seminars]] or [[laboratories]] and began to produce doctoral theses with more scientific content.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; According to Humboldt, the mission of the [[University of Berlin]] was to pursue scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The German university system fostered professional, bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed in well-equipped laboratories, instead of the kind of research done by private and individual scholars in Great Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.17-18&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rüegg asserts that the German system is responsible for the development of the modern research university because it focused on the idea of “freedom of scientific research, teaching and study.”&lt;ref&gt;Rüegg, "Themes", ''A History of the University in Europe, Vol. III'', p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Required education==
Mathematicians usually cover a breadth of topics within mathematics in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[graduate-level|graduate level]]. In some universities, a [[qualifying exam]] serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of mathematics; the students, who pass, are permitted to work on a [[doctoral dissertation]].

==Activities==
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|[[Emmy Noether]], mathematical theorist and teacher.]]

===Applied mathematics===
{{main|Applied mathematics}}
Mathematicians involved with solving problems with applications in real life are called [[applied mathematician]]s. Applied mathematicians are mathematical scientists who, with their specialized knowledge and [[professional]] methodology, approach many of the imposing problems presented in related scientific fields. With professional focus on a wide variety of problems, theoretical systems, and localized constructs, applied mathematicians work regularly in the study and formulation of [[mathematical models]]. Mathematicians and applied mathematicians are considered to be two of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The discipline of [[applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry; thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[professional]] specialty in which mathematicians work on problems, often concrete but sometimes abstract. As professionals focused on problem solving, ''applied mathematicians'' look into the ''formulation, study, and use of mathematical models'' in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and other areas of mathematical practice.

===Abstract mathematics===
{{main|Pure mathematics}}
[[Pure mathematics]] is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s. From the eighteenth century onwards, this was a recognized category of mathematical activity, sometimes characterized as ''speculative mathematics'',&lt;ref&gt;See for example titles of works by [[Thomas Simpson]] from the mid-18th century: ''Essays on Several Curious and Useful Subjects in Speculative and Mixed Mathematicks'', ''Miscellaneous Tracts on Some Curious and Very Interesting Subjects in Mechanics, Physical Astronomy and Speculative Mathematics''.{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Simpson, Thomas |volume=25 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and other applications.

Another insightful view put forth is that ''pure mathematics is not necessarily [[applied mathematics]]'': it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature, and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;Andy Magid, Letter from the Editor, in ''Notices of the AMS'', November 2005, American Mathematical Society, p.1173. [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

===Mathematics teaching===
Many professional mathematicians also engage in the teaching of mathematics. Duties may include:
* teaching university mathematics courses;
* supervising undergraduate and graduate research; and
* serving on academic committees.

===Consulting===
Many careers in mathematics outside of universities involve consulting. For instance, actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.

As another example, mathematical finance will derive and extend the [[Mathematical model|mathematical]] or [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] models without necessarily establishing a link to financial theory, taking observed market prices as input. Mathematical consistency is required, not compatibility with economic theory. Thus, for example, while a financial economist might study the structural reasons why a company may have a certain [[share price]], a financial mathematician may take the share price as a given, and attempt to use [[stochastic calculus]] to obtain the corresponding value of [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s of the [[stock]] (''see: [[Valuation of options]]; [[Financial modeling#Quantitative finance|Financial modeling]]'').

: ''Die Mathematiker sind eine Art Franzosen; redet man mit ihnen, so übersetzen sie es in ihre Sprache, und dann ist es alsobald ganz etwas anderes.'' (Mathematicians are [like] a sort of Frenchmen; if you talk to them, they translate it into their own language, and then it is immediately something quite different.)

: ''In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.''
::—[[Edgar Allan Poe]], ''The purloined letter''

: ''A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.''

== Prizes in mathematics ==
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics, though sometimes mathematicians have won the Nobel Prize in a different field, such as economics. Prominent prizes in mathematics include the [[Abel Prize]], the [[Chern Medal]], the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Gauss Prize]], the [[Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize|Nemmers Prize]], the [[Balzan Prize]], the [[Crafoord Prize]], the [[Shaw Prize]], the [[Steele Prize]], the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[Schock Prize]], and the [[Nevanlinna Prize]].

The [[American Mathematical Society]], [[Association for Women in Mathematics]], and other mathematical societies offer several prizes aimed at increasing the representation of women and minorities in the future of mathematics.

==Mathematical autobiographies==
Several well known mathematicians have written autobiographies in part to explain to a general audience what it is about mathematics that has made them want to devote their lives to its study. These provide some of the best glimpses into what it means to be a mathematician. The following list contains some works that are not autobiographies, but rather essays on mathematics and mathematicians with strong autobiographical elements.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = The recent surge of multiscale modeling from the smallest scale (atoms) to full system level (e.g., autos) related to solid mechanics that has now grown into an international multidisciplinary activity was birthed from an unlikely source. Since the US Department of Energy (DOE) national labs started to reduce nuclear underground tests in the mid 1980s, with the last one in 1992, the idea of simulation-based design and analysis concepts were birthed. Multiscale modeling was a key in garnering more precise and accurate predictive tools. In essence, the number of large scale systems level tests that were previously used to validate a design was reduced to nothing, thus warranting the increase in simulation results of the complex systems for design verification and validation purposes.

Essentially, the idea of filling the space of system level “tests” was then proposed to be filled by simulation results.  After the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty of 1996 in which many countries pledged to discontinue all systems level nuclear testing, programs like the Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) were birthed within the Department of Energy (DOE) and managed by the national labs within the US.  Within ASCI, the basic recognized premise was to provide more accurate and precise simulation-based design and analysis tools.  Because of the requirements for greater complexity in the simulations, parallel computing and multiscale modeling became the major challenges that needed to be addressed.  With this perspective, the idea of experiments shifted from the large scale complex tests to multiscale experiments that provided material models with validation at different length scales.  If the modeling and simulations were physically based and less empirical, then a predictive capability could be realized for other conditions. As such, various multiscale modeling methodologies were independently being created at the DOE national labs: Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  In addition, personnel from these national labs encouraged, funded, and managed academic research related to multiscale modeling.  Hence, the creation of different methodologies and computational algorithms for parallel environments gave rise to different emphases regarding multiscale modeling and the associated multiscale experiments.

The advent of parallel computing also contributed to the development of multiscale modeling.  Since more degrees of freedom could be resolved by parallel computing environments, more accurate and precise algorithmic formulations could be admitted.  This thought also drove the political leaders to encourage the simulation-based design concepts.

At LANL, LLNL, and ORNL, the multiscale modeling efforts were driven from the materials science and physics communities with a bottom-up approach.  Each had different programs that tried to unify computational efforts, materials science information, and applied mechanics algorithms with different levels of success. Multiple scientific articles were written, and the multiscale activities took different lives of their own.  At SNL, the multiscale modeling effort was an engineering top-down approach starting from continuum mechanics perspective, which was already rich with a computational paradigm. SNL tried to merge the materials science community into the continuum mechanics community to address the lower length scale issues that could help solve engineering problems in practice.

Once this management infrastructure and associated funding was in place at the various DOE institutions, different academic research projects started, initiating various satellite networks of multiscale modeling research. Technological transfer also arose into other labs within the Department of Defense and industrial research communities.

The growth of multiscale modeling in the industrial sector was primarily due to financial motivations.  From the DOE national labs perspective, the shift from large scale systems experiments mentality occurred because of the 1996 Nuclear Ban Treaty.  Once industry realized that the notions of multiscale modeling and simulation based design were invariant to the type of product and that effective multiscale simulations could in fact lead to design optimization, a paradigm shift began to occur, in  various measures within different industries, as cost savings and accuracy in product warranty estimates were rationalized.

The aforementioned DOE multiscale modeling efforts were hierarchical in nature.

==Areas of research==
In physics and chemistry, multiscale modeling is aimed to calculation of material properties or system behavior on one level using information or models from different levels. On each level particular approaches are used for description of a system. The following levels are usually distinguished: level of [[quantum mechanical model]]s (information about electrons is included), level of [[molecular dynamics]] models (information about individual atoms is included), [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] (information about atoms and/or groups of atoms is included), mesoscale or nano level (information about large groups of atoms and/or molecule positions is included), level of continuum models, level of device models. Each level addresses a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time. Multiscale modeling is particularly important in [[integrated computational materials engineering]] since it allows the prediction of material properties or system behavior based on knowledge of the process-structure-property relationships.

In [[operations research]], multiscale modeling addresses challenges for decision makers which come from multiscale phenomena across organizational, temporal and spatial scales. This theory fuses [[decision theory]] and multiscale mathematics and is referred to as [[multiscale decision-making]]. Multiscale decision-making draws upon the analogies between physical systems and complex man-made systems.

In meteorology, multiscale modeling is the modeling of interaction between weather systems of different spatial and temporal scales that produces the weather that we experience. The most challenging task is to model the way through which the weather systems interact as models cannot see beyond the limit of the model grid size. In other words, to run an atmospheric model that is having a grid size (very small ~ {{val|500|u=m}}) which can see each possible cloud structure for the whole globe is computationally very expensive. On the other hand, a computationally feasible [[Global climate model]] (GCM), with grid size ~ {{val|100|u=km}}, cannot see the smaller cloud systems. So we need to come to a balance point so that the model becomes computationally feasible and at the same time we do not lose much information, with the help of making some rational guesses, a process called Parametrization.

Besides the many specific applications, one area of research is methods for the accurate and efficient solution of multiscale modeling problems. The primary areas of mathematical and algorithmic development include:

*[[Analytical mechanics|Analytical modeling]]
*[[Center manifold]] and [[slow manifold]] theory
*[[Continuum mechanics|Continuum modeling]]
*[[Discrete modeling]]
*[[Network theory|Network-based modeling]]
*[[Statistical mechanics|Statistical modeling]]

In [[logic]] and [[probability theory]], two events (or propositions) are '''mutually exclusive''' or '''disjoint''' if they cannot both occur at the same time(be true). A clear example is the set of outcomes of a single coin toss, which can result in either heads or tails, but not both.

In the coin-tossing example, both outcomes are, in theory, [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively exhaustive]], which means that at least one of the outcomes must happen, so these two possibilities together exhaust all the possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Scott |first2=Donald |last2=Childers |title=Probability and Random Processes |location= |publisher=Academic Press |edition=Second |year=2012 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-12-386981-4 |quote=The sample space is the collection or set of 'all possible' distinct (collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive) outcomes of an experiment. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all mutually exclusive events are collectively exhaustive. For example, the outcomes 1 and 4 of a single roll of a [[six-sided die]] are mutually exclusive (both cannot happen at the same time) but not collectively exhaustive (there are other possible outcomes; 2,3,5,6).

==Logic==
In [[logic]], two mutually exclusive propositions are propositions that [[logical possibility|logically cannot]] be true in the same sense at the same time. To say that more than two propositions are mutually exclusive, depending on context, means that one cannot be true if the other one is true, or at least one of them cannot be true. The term ''pairwise mutually exclusive'' always means that two of them cannot be true simultaneously.

==Probability==
In [[probability theory]], events ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be '''mutually exclusive''' if the occurrence of any one of them implies the non-occurrence of the remaining ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 events. Therefore, two mutually exclusive events cannot both occur. Formally said, the intersection of each two of them is empty (the null event): ''A''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∅. In consequence, mutually exclusive events have the property: P(''A'' ∩ ''B'') = 0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intmath.com/Counting-probability/9_Mutually-exclusive-events.php intmath.com]; Mutually Exclusive Events. Interactive Mathematics. December 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it is impossible to draw a card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be drawn. When ''A'' and ''B'' are mutually exclusive, P(''A'' ∪ ''B'') = P(''A'') + P(''B'').&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;[http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch05-rul.html Stats: Probability Rules.]&lt;/ref&gt; To find the probability of drawing a red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of drawing a red card and the probability of drawing a club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.

One would have to draw at least two cards in order to draw both a red card and a club. The probability of doing so in two draws depends on whether the first card drawn were replaced before the second drawing, since without replacement there is one fewer card after the first card was drawn. The probabilities of the individual events (red, and club) are multiplied rather than added. The probability of drawing a red and a club in two drawings without replacement is then 26/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13/51&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 = 676/2652, or 13/51. With replacement, the probability would be 26/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;13/52&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2 = 676/2704, or 13/52.

In probability theory, the word ''or'' allows for the possibility of both events happening. The probability of one or both events occurring is denoted P(''A'' ∪ ''B'') and in general it equals P(''A'') + P(''B'') – P(''A'' ∩ ''B'').&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt; Therefore, in the case of drawing a red card or a king, drawing any of a red king, a red non-king, or a black king is considered a success. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and four kings, two of which are red, so the probability of drawing a red or a king is 26/52 + 4/52 – 2/52 = 28/52.

Events are [[collectively exhaustive]] if all the possibilities for outcomes are exhausted by those possible events, so at least one of those outcomes must occur. The probability that at least one of the events will occur is equal to one.&lt;ref name="events"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720051423/http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM4341/BayesPrimer2.pdf Scott Bierman. A Probability Primer. Carleton College. Pages 3-4.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are theoretically only two possibilities for flipping a coin. Flipping a head and flipping a tail are collectively exhaustive events, and there is a probability of one of flipping either a head or a tail. Events can be both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; In the case of flipping a coin, flipping a head and flipping a tail are also mutually exclusive events. Both outcomes cannot occur for a single trial (i.e., when a coin is flipped only once). The probability of flipping a head and the probability of flipping a tail can be added to yield a probability of 1: 1/2 + 1/2 =1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/CliffsReviewTopic/NonMutually-Exclusive-Outcomes.topicArticleId-25951,articleId-25914.html Non-Mutually Exclusive Outcomes. CliffsNotes.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]] and [[regression analysis]], an [[dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] that can take on only two possible values is called a [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]]. For example, it may take on the value 0 if an observation is of a male subject or 1 if the observation is of a female subject. The two possible categories associated with the two possible values are mutually exclusive, so that no observation falls into more than one category, and the categories are exhaustive, so that every observation falls into some category. Sometimes there are three or more possible categories, which are pairwise mutually exclusive and are collectively exhaustive — for example, under 18 years of age, 18 to 64 years of age, and age 65 or above. In this case a set of dummy variables is constructed, each dummy variable having two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive categories — in this example, one dummy variable (called D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) would equal 1 if age is less than 18, and would equal 0 ''otherwise''; a second dummy variable (called D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would equal 1 if age is in the range 18-64, and 0 otherwise. In this set-up, the dummy variable pairs (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can have the values (1,0) (under 18), (0,1) (between 18 and 64), or (0,0) (65 or older) (but not (1,1), which would nonsensically imply that an observed subject is both under 18 and between 18 and 64). Then the dummy variables can be included as independent (explanatory) variables in a regression. Note that the number of dummy variables is always one less than the number of categories: with the two categories male and female there is a single dummy variable to distinguish them, while with the three age categories two dummy variables are needed to distinguish them.

Such [[qualitative data]] can also be used for [[dependent variable]]s. For example, a researcher might want to predict whether someone goes to college or not, using family income, a gender dummy variable, and so forth as explanatory variables. Here the variable to be explained is a dummy variable that equals 0 if the observed subject does not go to college and equals 1 if the subject does go to college. In such a situation, [[ordinary least squares]] (the basic regression technique) is widely seen as inadequate; instead [[probit regression]] or [[logistic regression]] is used. Further, sometimes there are three or more categories for the dependent variable — for example, no college, community college, and four-year college. In this case, the [[multinomial probit]] or [[multinomial logit]] technique is used.

The '''one-shot deviation principle''' (also known as '''one-deviation property'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategy: An Introduction to Game Theory|last=Watson|first=Joel|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2013|isbn=978-0393123876|location=New York|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the principle of optimality of [[dynamic programming]] applied to [[game theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwell|first=David|date=1965|title=Discounting Dynamic Programming|url=|journal=Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=36|pages=226–235|via=|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177700285}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It says that a strategy profile of a finite [[extensive-form game]] is a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] (SPE) if and only if there exist no profitable one-shot deviations for each subgame and every player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tirole|first1=Jean|last2=Fudenberg|first2=Drew|title=Game theory|year=1991|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-262-06141-4|edition=6. printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, if no player can increase their payoffs by deviating a single decision, or period, from their original strategy, then the strategy that they have chosen is a SPE. As a result, no player can profit from deviating from the strategy for one period and then reverting to the strategy. 

Furthermore, the one-shot deviation principle is very important for infinite horizon games, in which the principle typically does not hold&lt;ref&gt;Obara, I. (2012). Subgame Perfect Equilibrium [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.econ.ucla.edu/iobara/SPE201B.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, since it is not plausible to consider an infinite number of strategies and payoffs in order to solve. In an infinite horizon game where the [[discount factor]] is less than 1, a strategy profile is a subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the one-shot deviation principle&lt;ref&gt;Ozdaglar, A. (2010). Repeated Games [PDF document]. Slide 13. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT6_254S10_lec15.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The following is the paraphrased definition from Watson (2013)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To check whether strategy ''s'' is a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, we have to ask every player ''i'' and every subgame, if considering ''s'', there is a strategy ''s’'' that yields a strictly higher payoff for player ''i'' than does ''s'' in the subgame. This analysis is equivalent to looking at single deviations from ''s'', meaning ''s’'' differs from s at only one information set. Note that the choices associated with ''s'' and ''s’'' are the same at all nodes that are successors of nodes in the information set where s and ''s’'' prescribe different actions. 

=== Example ===
Consider a [[symmetric game]] with two players in which each player makes binary choice decisions, A or B, in three sequences. There are 8 (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) total number of pure strategies for each player: {AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BBB, BBA, BAB, BAA}. In this example, consider that a player chooses strategy (AAA). To check whether this strategy is a SPE, the one-shot deviation principle states that the player needs to check the payoffs of only three other strategies which differ from the original strategy by a single deviation, instead of all seven others. These three strategies are: ('''B'''AA), (A'''B'''A), and (AA'''B'''). If none of these three strategies yields a higher payoff than (AAA), then the player can conclude that (AAA) is a SPE.

A '''parity plot''' is a [[scatterplot]] that compares experimental data against tabulated data.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} Each point has coordinates (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), where ''x'' is the tabulated value, and ''y'' is the corresponding experimental value.

A line of the equation ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' is sometimes added as a reference. When an experimental value equals a tabulated value, the point will lie on the line.

Parity plots are found in scientific papers and reports, when the author wishes to compare his data to accepted values in an easily understandable way.

{{short description|A philosophical theory of mathematics}}{{Postmodernism}}

'''Postmodern mathematics''' is a thought developed as a result of postmodernism. The theory asserts that there is no such thing as ‘absolutism’ or ultimate truth in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moslehian|first=M. S.|date=November 2005|title=Postmodern view of humanistic mathematics|journal=Resonance|language=en|volume=10|issue=11|pages=98–105|doi=10.1007/bf02837651|issn=0971-8044}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also declares that the term ‘mathematics’ can’t be used to define a specific object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This thought emerged from the post modernistic idea of the relativity of truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; The thought also maintains that the ideas in mathematics are subjective and that there is no ‘right’ answer to a mathematical question.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ideas ==
The ideas affirmed in Postmodern Mathematics can be summed up as follows:

=== Plurality ===
The term 'Mathematics', in its singular form, cannot be used to describe any object.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Ernest|first=Paul|date=2015|pages=605–608|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-12688-3_68|isbn=9783319106854|book-title=The Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Mathematical Education|title=Postmodern Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mathematics, in its plural form, describes the multiplicity of this term based on the context it is used in. All these various definitions are not necessarily true or false and can be right or wrong based on the context they are defined in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Rejection of 'universality' and 'absolutism' ===
Postmodernism rejects the idea of universality in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It claims that there is no such thing as 'absolutism' and asserts the notion of multiplicity in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This comes from the postmodernist idea that rejects notions of absolutism and the claim that the knowledge we attain as ‘true’ is only a representation constructed by society which is not truer than any other representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Postmodernists also reject the absolutist idea of mathematics being “human free” and objective and instead assert a “humanistic” view of mathematics which is filled with subjective and humane values.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52100009|title=The philosophy of mathematics education|last=Paul.|first=Ernest,|date=1991|publisher=Falmer Press|isbn=020322423X|location=London|oclc=52100009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view sees mathematics as: &lt;blockquote&gt;imbued with moral and social values which play a significant role in the development and applications of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rejection of certainty ===
Certainty in mathematics is not attainable. The answers proposed are perceived as probabilities and not certainties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Postmodernism in mathematics oppose Aristotelian and modernist concept of an object being either true or false and instead asserts the concept of a “degree of truth”. Thus, proclaiming the notion of partial truths and uncertainty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the Postmodernist thought, theories in mathematics accepted as 'true' and 'certain' are products of society as the criteria for 'certainty' and 'truth' are socially constructed. Therefore, postmodernism rejects the notion of certainty and absolute truth in mathematics as certainties in mathematics are not static and can change throughout time and societies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is significant as mathematics is usually perceived as the "most certain part of human knowledge", questioning the certainty of this part of knowledge thus rejects certainty from any form of human knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Fallibility in mathematics ===
Mathematics is a corrigible discipline as it is subject to the notion of fallibility and is in a state of constant change.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernest|first=Paul|last2=Izmirli|first2=Ilhan|date=2011|title=Does a Postmodernist Philosophy of Mathematics Make Sense? Is "2 + 2 = 5" Correct as Long as One's Personal Situation or Perspective Requires It?|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/|journal=Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was first proposed by Lakatos in his book "Proofs and Refutation". It also constitutes the hypothetical-deductive system of mathematics which declares that the discipline of mathematics is fallible and corrigible, the development of theorems require the falsification of “falsifiers” and transmission to hypothetical knowledge. In other words, in order to develop theorems, one must first falsify the premises under which the theorem would be falsified.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This would further constitute that mathematics is connected as a part of the broad human knowledge, including the culture, language and perspectives.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Social [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]] in mathematics ===
As theories and laws proclaimed in mathematics are representations made by the society, mathematics is constructed by the needs of societies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hence, holds no other value other than being representations of cultures and societies.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== History ==
Postmodernism was a movement that started against modernism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Modernism values the faith in the existence of an objective and universal truth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Frederick|last2=Sriraman|first2=Bharath|date=2017-06-15|title=Breaking the Constraints of Modernist Psychologizing: Mathematics Education Flirts with the Postmodern|journal=Interchange|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=351–362|doi=10.1007/s10780-017-9306-1|issn=0826-4805}}&lt;/ref&gt; For modernists, knowledge is the use of empirical methodologies in order to discover the ‘ultimate truth’. Postmodernism counters that knowledge isn’t as empirical and logical as modernism persists, rather it is subjective and is open to change.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernest|first=Paul|date=1997|title=Chapter 3: The Epistemological Basis of Qualitative Research in Mathematics Education: A Postmodern Perspective|journal=Journal for Research in Mathematics Education. Monograph|volume=9|pages=22–177|doi=10.2307/749945|jstor=749945}}&lt;/ref&gt; For postmodernists, knowledge is a construct of the society and is subject to change over time and place.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In mathematics, modernism asserts notions of [[Platonism]] (the view that theories in mathematics are unchangeable and perceives mathematics as perfect and eternal),&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moslehian|first=Mohammad|date=2003|title=A glance at Postmodern pedagogy of mathematics|url=|journal=Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logicism]] (the view that perceives mathematics as a part of Logic)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|Formalism]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These concepts were accepted universally before the introduction of postmodernism. This change in thoughts brought about by the introduction of postmodernism caused a shift of mathematics research and practice from “logical theories” and challenged the notion of objectivity, universality and certainty in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Unlike modernist ideas of singularity, postmodernism denotes the idea of plurality and polycentrism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Postmodernism also promotes the idea of collaboration between the teachers and students of mathematics as it argues for the idea of everyone being an explorer of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/pome18/tarp_modern_and_poMo_critical_research.htm|title=Modern and Postmodern Critical Research|last=Tarp|first=Allan|date=2018|website=socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernism, on the other hand, propose no question for the nature of mathematics or education as they contend that the two entities are not related to one another.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this thought, students in search of education, mathematics in this context, are exploring an “independent world”. This independent world remains unhinged by the student’s exploration and is not changed by the students’ encounter as they are two separate entities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postmodernism, on the other hand, encourages the transformation of knowledge by the student as they believe that the two only exist “relative to one another”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Notable figures ==
=== [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] ===
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) developed a notion against the modernist idea of rationality and claimed that it is isn’t as evident and clear as perceived by modernists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He claimed that certainty in mathematics is “a collection of language games” and truth and false are based on the their following of “the rules of linguistic games”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It is what human beings say that is true and false: and they agree in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49055907|title=Philosophical investigations : the German text, with a revised English translation|last=1889-1951.|first=Wittgenstein, Ludwig,|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell|others=Anscombe, G.

Karl Popper (1902-1994) introduced the notion of falsification and asserted that to prove theories in sciences, researchers should strive to disprove them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also asserted that the laws in mathematics are subject to being proven false and hence rejected the idea of ultimate truths.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=Karl Popper|date=2018-10-01|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Karl_Popper&amp;oldid=862051499|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Professor Imre Lakatos, c1960s (4111988460).jpg|thumb|209x209px|Imre Lakatos, Professor of Mathematics and author of ''Proofs and Refutations'']]
Imre Lakatos (1922-1974) was inspired by Karl Popper's idea of falsification in mathematics and wrote his thesis on the fallibility of mathematics and mathematical theorems.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In his book, titled ‘Proofs and refutations’, Lakatos claimed that all the theorems in mathematics are fallible and the theories that are accepted as ‘true’ or ‘perfect’ are only accepted because there hasn’t been any theorem that counters them.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|title=Imre Lakatos|date=2018-10-07|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imre_Lakatos&amp;oldid=862877140|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that theories in mathematics have no basis for certainty as they are products of assumptions made by humans and are  hence refutable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===[[Paul Ernest]]===
Paul Ernest has extensive works on the philosophy of mathematics where he draws upon the works of other postmodern philosophers including Popper and Lakatos.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|title=Paul Ernest|date=2018-10-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Ernest&amp;oldid=863756053|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works mainly reflect his belief in the social constructivism of mathematics which illustrates that mathematical theories are a construct of the society and are thus changeable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He also published the "Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal" which contributes to discussions of the philosophy of mathematics and mathematics education and has extensive articles on postmodern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernest|first=Paul|date=|title=Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wilkinson ===
He introduced the idea of 'fuzzy logic'. This idea rejects the Aristotelian Law of Truth and fallibility of an object (the notion that an object is either true or false). He instead proposed the existence of 'degrees of truth', the idea that an object is characterised into various degrees of truth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== [[Thomas Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn:]] ===
Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) introduced the idea of paradigm shifts in sciences. he asserted that the paradigms and theories in sciences are not fixed but are instead on a continuum and hence are subject to transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Thomas Kuhn|date=2018-08-26|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Kuhn&amp;oldid=856611375|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his theory of paradigms as: &lt;blockquote&gt;''.. each paradigm will be shown to satisfy more or less the criteria that it dictates for itself and to fall short of a few of those dictated by its opponent. .. no paradigm ever solves all the problems it defines ..'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|last=S.|first=Kuhn, Thomas|date=1970|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226458038|edition= Second, enlarged|location=Chicago|oclc=93075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Kuhn, education and knowledge strives to interpret and represent rather than provide an objective explanation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These representations are examples of social constructivism and are products of societies throughout time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Postmodern mathematics in education ==
In the postmodernist view, mathematics is learnt not for knowledge but for utility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to this thought, teachers are not only an ‘authoritative figure’ but are also co-explorers and learners of mathematics&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or as described by Ernest, “ringmasters of the mathematics circus”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also assert on the role of students in the teaching mathematics and their role in the shaping of curriculum.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Postmodern mathematics asserts the diminishing of the notion of objectivity and absolutism in mathematics thus asserting that a “notion of 2 + 2 = 1” can be true given certain subjective circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Declining Standards at Michigan Public Universities. How Changes in Curricula and Teaching Affect Academic Achievement, Career Preparation, and K-12 Education.|last=Bertonneau|first=Thomas|publisher=Mackinac Center for Public Policy.|year=1997|isbn=978-0-9647703-9-3|edition= Second|location=|pages=56–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it doesn’t mean that the notion can be used based on any ‘personal situation’ rather it is relative to the mathematical context and situation it is used in such that 2 +2 = 1 is true in mod (3) arithmetic but it would never be true in any other mathematical context.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hence, mathematical theories are corrigible based on the mathematical contexts they are used in.

Unlike the modernist idea of teachers being the authoritative figure and “echo-phrasing” the textbooks, postmodernism encourages collaborative work between the students and the teachers which again relates to the notion of ‘truth’ and ‘knowledge’ being subjective.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This would also emphasise the notion that students should be given the opportunity to exercise alternate methods and solutions to the ones determined by the teachers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If mathematics education is reshaped according to the postmodernist thought, it opens up windows for the implementation of mathematics by the students to their everyday life, culture and language. It enables them to reshape their knowledge of mathematics and concepts of mathematics.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Mathematics becomes responsible for its uses and consequences, in education and society. Those of us in education have a special reason for wanting this more human view of mathematics. Anything else alienates and dis-empowers learners.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Postmodern education also encourages the use of technology and computers in the discovery of new ideas in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although these ideas are subject to uncertainty as denoted by postmodernism, they can still have the same or higher ‘degree of truth’ as those proven and discovered by classical methods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The rejection of uncertainty also asserts researchers of mathematics and other knowledge to strive to achieve a higher degree of truth for human knowledge and hence encourages further research and study. This in turn expands the human knowledge vastly.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Postmodern education encourages teachers, students and researchers of mathematics to focus on criticism of the known mathematical facts rather than evaluation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It asserts that mathematicians should focus not on what ‘mathematics’ is but rather what it could be and what it might be. It encourages constant criticism of the mathematical theories and trying to disprove the theories in order to get a higher degree of truth in mathematics education.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]] describes this as &lt;blockquote&gt;Reality (certainty in this context) is not expressed by a phrase like X is such but by one like X is such and not such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17621488|title=The differend : phrases in dispute|last=1924-1998.|first=Lyotard, Jean-François,|date=1988|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=0816616116|location=Minneapolis|pages=48|oclc=17621488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also claims that to prove the ‘reality’ or the ‘truth’ of a description of an entity, which in this context would be mathematics, the negation of another description is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rømer|first=Thomas|date=2005-05-25|title=LEARNING AND ASSESSMENT IN POSTMODERN EDUCATION|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-5446.2003.00313.x|journal=Educational Theory|volume=53|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13237">In [[mathematics]], a proof by '''infinite descent''' is a particular kind of [[proof by contradiction]] that relies on the [[least integer principle]]. One typical application is to show that a given equation has no solutions.

Typically, one shows that if a solution to a problem existed, which in some sense was related to one or more natural numbers, it would necessarily imply that a second solution existed, which was related to one or more 'smaller' natural numbers. This in turn would imply a third solution related to smaller natural numbers, implying a fourth solution, therefore a fifth solution, and so on. However, there cannot be an infinity of ever-smaller natural numbers, and therefore by [[mathematical induction]] (repeating the same step) the original premise&amp;mdash;that any solution exists&amp;mdash; is incorrect: its correctness produces a [[contradiction]].

An alternative way to express this is to assume one or more solutions or examples exists. Then there must be a smallest solution or example&amp;mdash;a [[minimal counterexample]]. We then prove that if a smallest solution exists, it must imply the existence of a smaller solution (in some sense)&amp;mdash;which again proves that the existence of any solution would lead to a contradiction.

The earliest uses of the method of infinite descent appear in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']]. A typical example is Proposition 31 of Book 7, in which [[Euclid]] proves that every composite integer is divided (in Euclid's terminology "measured") by some prime number. 

The method was much later developed by [[Fermat]], who coined the term and often used it for [[Diophantine equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Weil | first = André | author-link = André Weil | title = Number Theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre | publisher = [[Birkhäuser Verlag|Birkhäuser]] | year = 1984 | pages = 75–79 | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two typical examples are showing the non-solvability of the Diophantine equation ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and proving [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], which states that an odd prime ''p'' can be expressed as a sum of two [[square number|squares]] only when ''p''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;([[Modular arithmetic|mod]]&amp;nbsp;4) (see [[Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares#Euler.27s proof by infinite descent|proof]]). In some cases, to the modern eye, his "method of infinite descent" is an exploitation of the [[Inversive geometry|inversion]] of the doubling function for [[rational point]]s on an elliptic curve ''E''. The context is of a hypothetical non-trivial rational point on ''E''. Doubling a point on ''E'' roughly doubles the length of the numbers required to write it (as number of digits), so that a "halving" a point gives a rational with smaller terms. Since the terms are positive, they cannot decrease forever. In this way Fermat was able to show the non-existence of solutions in many cases of Diophantine equations of classical interest (for example, the problem of four perfect squares in [[arithmetic progression]]).

== Number theory==
In the [[number theory]] of the twentieth century, the infinite descent method was taken up again, and pushed to a point where it connected with the main thrust of [[algebraic number theory]] and the study of [[L-function]]s. The structural result of [[Mordell]], that the rational points on an elliptic curve ''E'' form a [[finitely-generated abelian group]], used an infinite descent argument based on ''E''/2''E'' in Fermat's style.

To extend this to the case of an [[abelian variety]] ''A'', [[André Weil]] had to make more explicit the way of quantifying the size of a solution, by means of a [[Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry#Height function|height function]] – a concept that became foundational. To show that ''A''(''Q'')/2''A''(''Q'') is finite, which is certainly a necessary condition for the finite generation of the group ''A''(''Q'') of rational points of ''A'', one must do calculations in what later was recognised as [[Galois cohomology]]. In this way, abstractly-defined cohomology groups in the theory become identified with ''descents'' in the tradition of Fermat. The [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] was at the start of what later became a very extensive theory.

=== Irrationality of {{radic|2}} ===
The proof that the [[square root of 2]] ({{radic|2}}) is [[irrational number|irrational]] (i.e. cannot be expressed as a fraction of two whole numbers) was discovered by the [[ancient Greek]]s, and is perhaps the earliest known example of a proof by infinite descent. [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] discovered that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its side, or in modern language, that the square root of two is [[irrational number|irrational]]. Little is known with certainty about the time or circumstances of this discovery, but the name of [[Hippasus]] of Metapontum is often mentioned. For a while, the Pythagoreans treated as an official secret the discovery that the square root of two is irrational, and, according to legend, Hippasus was murdered for divulging it.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie J. Morris, [http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt669/student.folders/morris.stephanie/emt.669/essay.1/pythagorean.html "The Pythagorean Theorem"], Dept. of Math. Ed., [[University of Georgia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Clegg, [http://nrich.maths.org/2671 "The Dangerous Ratio ..."], Nrich.org, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt von Fritz, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1969021 "The discovery of incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum"], Annals of Mathematics, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; The square root of two is occasionally called "Pythagoras' number" or "Pythagoras' Constant", for example {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The [[ancient Greek]]s, not having [[algebra]], worked out a [[Square root of 2#Geometric proof|geometric proof]] by infinite descent ([[John Horton Conway]] presented another [http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sq_root.shtml geometric proof (no. 8 ' ' ' )] by infinite descent that may be more accessible). The following is an [[algebra]]ic proof along similar lines:

Suppose that {{radic|2}} were [[rational number|rational]]. Then it could be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

for two natural numbers, {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Then squaring would give

:&lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = p^2, &lt;/math&gt;

so 2 must divide ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Because 2 is a [[prime number]], it must also divide ''p'', by [[Euclid's lemma]]. So ''p'' = 2''r'', for some integer ''r''.

But then

:&lt;math&gt;2q^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^2 = 2r^2, &lt;/math&gt;

which shows that 2 must divide ''q'' as well. So ''q'' = 2''s'' for some integer ''s''.

This gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}=\frac{2r}{2s}=\frac{r}{s}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, if {{radic|2}} could be written as a rational number, it could always be written as a rational number with smaller parts, which itself could be written with yet-smaller parts, ''[[ad infinitum]]''. But [[Well-ordering principle|this is impossible in the set of natural numbers]].  Since {{radic|2}} is a [[real number]], which can be either rational or irrational, the only option left is for {{radic|2}} to be irrational.

(Alternatively, this proves that if {{radic|2}} were rational, no "smallest" representation as a fraction could exist, as any attempt to find a "smallest" representation ''p''/''q'' would imply a smaller one existed, which is a similar contradiction).

=== Irrationality of {{radic|''k''}} if it is not an integer ===

For positive integer ''k'', suppose that {{radic|''k''}} is not an integer, but is rational and can be expressed as &lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', and let ''q'' be the largest integer no greater than {{radic|''k''}}.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sqrt k &amp;=\frac mn\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m(\sqrt k-q)}{n(\sqrt k-q)}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{m\sqrt k-mq}{n\sqrt k-nq}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{(n \sqrt k)\sqrt k-mq}{n (\frac{m}{n}) -nq}\\
[8pt] &amp;=\frac{nk-mq}{m-nq}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The numerator and denominator were each multiplied by the expression ({{radic|''k''}} − ''q'')—which is positive but less than 1—and then simplified independently. So two resulting products, say ''m' '' and ''n' '', are themselves integers, which are less than ''m'' and ''n'' respectively.  Therefore, no matter what natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'' are used to express {{radic|''k''}}, there exist smaller natural numbers ''m' '' &lt; ''m'' and ''n' '' &lt; ''n'' that have the same ratio.  But infinite descent on the natural numbers is impossible, so this disproves the original assumption that {{radic|''k''}} could be expressed as a ratio of natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sagher | first = Yoram |date=February 1988 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 95 | page = 117 | title = What Pythagoras could have done | doi=10.2307/2323064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-solvability of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''s''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and its permutations===
{{See also|Fermat's right triangle theorem#Fermat's proof}}

The non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers is sufficient to show the non-solvability of &lt;math&gt;q^4 + s^4 =t^4&lt;/math&gt; in integers, which is a special case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the historical proofs of the latter proceeded by more broadly proving the former using infinite descent. The following more recent proof demonstrates both of these impossibilities by proving still more broadly that a [[Pythagorean triangle]] cannot have any two of its sides each either a square or twice a square, since there is no smallest such triangle:&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Stan, "Fermat's method of ''descente infinie''", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'' 95, July 2011, 269–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose there exists such a Pythagorean triangle. Then it can be scaled down to give a primitive (i.e., with no common factors other than 1) Pythagorean triangle with the same property. Primitive Pythagorean triangles' sides can be written as &lt;math&gt;x=2ab,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y=a^2-b^2,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;, with ''a'' and ''b'' [[coprime|relatively prime]] and with ''a+b'' odd and hence ''y'' and ''z'' both odd. The property that ''y'' and ''z'' are each odd means that neither  ''y'' nor ''z'' can be twice a square. Furthermore, if ''x'' is a square or twice a square, then each of ''a'' and ''b'' is a square or twice a square. There are three cases, depending on which two sides are postulated to each be a square or twice a square:

*'''''y'' and ''z''''': In this case ''y'' and ''z'' are both squares. But then the right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{yz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; also would have integer sides including a square leg (&lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt;) and a square hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;), and would have a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).
*'''''z'' and ''x''''': ''z'' is a square. The integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; also would have two sides (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) each of which is a square or twice a square, and a smaller hypotenuse (&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; compared to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
*'''''y'' and ''x''''': ''y'' is a square. The integer right triangle with legs &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; and hypotenuse &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; would have two sides (''b'' and ''a'') each of which is a square or twice a square, with a smaller hypotenuse than the original triangle (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; compared to &lt;math&gt;z=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;).

In any of these cases, one Pythagorean triangle with two sides each of which is a square or twice a square has led to a smaller one, which in turn would lead to a smaller one, etc.; since such a sequence cannot go on infinitely, the original premise that such a triangle exists must be wrong.

This implies that the equations
:&lt;math&gt;r^2 + s^4 = t^4,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r^4 + s^2 =t^4,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;r^4 + s^4 =t^2&lt;/math&gt;
cannot have non-trivial solutions, since non-trivial solutions would give Pythagorean triangles with two sides being squares.

The '''quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model''' is a [[biological neuron model]] and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes [[action potentials]] in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]], the QIF model seeks only to produce [[action potential]]-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

A quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the [[autonomous differential equation]],

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a "spike" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.

When implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (&lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt;) and a reset value (&lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold, &lt;math&gt;x(t) \geq V_t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is immediately reset to &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3812">'''Resource selection functions''' (RSFs) are a class of functions that are used in [[spatial ecology]] to assess which habitat characteristics are important to a specific population or species of animal, by assessing the a probability of that animal using a certain resource proportional to the availability of that resource in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mark S|last2=Vernier|first2=Pierre R|last3=Nielsen|first3=Scott E|last4=Schmiegelow|first4=Fiona K. A|date=2002-11-30|title=Evaluating resource selection functions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002004|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=157|issue=2–3|pages=281–300|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00200-4|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.8823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling ==
Resource Selection Functions require two types of data: location information for the wildlife in question, and data on the resources available across the study area. Resources can include a broad range of environmental and geographical variables, including categorical variables such as land cover type, or continuous variables such as average rainfall over a given time period. A variety of methods are used for modeling RSFs, with [[logistic regression]] being commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Resource Selection by Animals: Statistical Design and Analysis for Field Studies|last=Manly|first=B. F.|last2=McDonald|first2=L.|last3=Thomas|first3=Dana|last4=McDonald|first4=Trent L.|last5=Erickson|first5=Wallace P.|date=2007-05-08|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780306481512|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RSFs can be fit to data where animal presence is known, but absence is not, such as for species where several individuals within a study area are fitted with a GPS collar, but some individuals may be present without collars.
When this is the case, buffers of various distances are generated around known presence points, with a number of available points generated within each buffer, which represent areas where the animal could have been, but it is unknown whether they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Chris J.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Scott E.|last3=Merrill|first3=Evelyn H.|last4=Mcdonald|first4=Trent L.|last5=Boyce|first5=Mark S.|date=2006-04-01|title=Resource Selection Functions Based on Use–Availability Data: Theoretical Motivation and Evaluation Methods|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|volume=70|issue=2|pages=347–357|doi=10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[347:RSFBOU]2.0.CO;2|issn=0022-541X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These models can be fit using binomial generalized linear models or binomial generalized linear mixed models, with the resources, or environmental and geographic data, as explanatory variables.

== Scale ==
Resource selection functions can be modeled at a variety of spatial scales, depending on the species and the scientific question being studied. (insert one more sentence on scale)

Most RSFs address one of the following scales, which were defined by Douglas Johnson in 1980 and are still used today:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Douglas H.|date=1980-02-01|title=The Comparison of Usage and Availability Measurements for Evaluating Resource Preference|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.2307/1937156|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1937156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''First order selection:''' The entire range of a species
* '''Second order selection:''' The home range of an individual or group of animals
* '''Third order selection:''' Resource or habitat usage within an individual's or group's home range 
* '''Fourth order selection:''' The procurement of specific resources, such as food, at specific sites

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">In [[computational learning theory]], '''sample exclusion dimensions''' arise in the study of exact [[concept learning]] with queries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithmic Learning Theory: 12th International Conference, ALT 2001, Washington, DC, USA, November 2001, Proceedings |editor=N. Abe |editor2=R. Khardon |editor3=T. Zeugmann |author=D. Angluin |chapter=Queries Revisited |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |pages=26–28 |isbn=3-540-42875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[algorithmic learning theory]], a '''concept''' over a domain ''X'' is a [[Boolean function]] over ''X''. Here we only consider finite domains. A '''partial approximation''' ''S'' of a concept ''c'' is a Boolean function over &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that ''c'' is an extension to ''S''.

Let ''C'' be a class of concepts and ''c'' be a concept (not necessarily in ''C''). Then a '''specifying set''' for c w.r.t. ''C'', denoted by ''S'' is a partial approximation ''S'' of ''c'' such that ''C'' contains at most one extension to ''S''. If we have observed a specifying set for some concept w.r.t. ''C'', then we have enough information to verify a concept in ''C'' with at most one more mind change.
 
The '''exclusion dimension''', denoted by ''XD''(''C''), of a concept class is the maximum of the size of the minimum specifying set of ''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; with respect to ''C'', where ''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a concept not in ''C''.

'''String art''', or '''pin and thread art''', is characterized by an arrangement of colored thread strung between points to form  [[geometric pattern]]s or representational designs such as a ship's [[sail]]s, sometimes with other artist material comprising the remainder of the work. Thread, wire, or string is wound around a grid of nails hammered into a [[velvet]]-covered wooden board. Though straight lines are formed by the string, the slightly different angles and metric positions at which strings intersect gives the appearance of [[Bézier curve]]s (as in the mathematical concept of [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of a family of straight lines). [[Bézier curve#Quadratic curves|Quadratic Bézier curve]] are obtained from strings based on two intersecting segments. Other forms of string art include [[Spirelli]], which is used for [[cardmaking]] and [[scrapbooking]], and curve stitching, in which string is stitched through holes.

String art has its origins in the 'curve stitch' activities invented by [[Mary Everest Boole]] at the end of the 19th century to make mathematical ideas more accessible to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Mary Everest Boole: An Erstwhile Pedagogist for Contemporary Times|title=Vita mathematica|editor1-last=Calinger|editor1-first=Ronald|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-88385-097-4|last=Michalowicz|first=Karen Dee Ann|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularised as a decorative craft in the late 1960s through kits and books.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A [http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/knit.html computational form of String art] that can produce photo-realistic artwork was introduced by Petros Vrellis, in 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">[[Image:Halmos symbols.png|frame|right|Various forms of the end-of-proof symbol]]
The '''tombstone''', '''Halmos''', '''end of proof''', or '''Q.E.D.''' mark "∎" is used in [[mathematics]] to denote the end of a [[Mathematical proof|proof]], in place of the traditional abbreviation "Q.E.D."  for the Latin phrase "''[[Q.E.D.|quod erat demonstrandum]]''", "which was to be shown". In magazines, it is one of the various symbols used to indicate the end of an article.

In [[Unicode]], it is represented as character {{unichar|220E|End of Proof|html=}}. Its graphic form varies. It may be a hollow or filled rectangle or square.

In [[AMS-LaTeX]], the symbol is automatically appended at the end of a proof environment &lt;tt&gt;\begin{proof}&lt;/tt&gt; ... &lt;tt&gt;\end{proof}&lt;/tt&gt;. It can also be obtained from the commands &lt;tt&gt;\qedsymbol&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;\qed&lt;/tt&gt; (the latter causes the symbol to be right aligned).

It is sometimes called a halmos after the mathematician [[Paul Halmos]], who first used it in mathematical context. He got the idea of using it from seeing it was being used to indicate the end of articles in [[magazine]]s. In his memoir ''I Want to Be a Mathematician'', he wrote the following:&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Halmos, ''I Want to Be a Mathematician: An Automathography'', 1985, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The symbol is definitely not my invention&amp;nbsp;— it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.}}
