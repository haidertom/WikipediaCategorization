The '''15th World Scout Jamboree''' was scheduled to be held 15–23 July 1979 and was to be hosted by [[Iran]] at [[Nishapur]], but was cancelled due to the [[Iranian Revolution]] which took place in 1979. 

The 15th World Jamboree was to be held at the 10 square kilometre [[Omar Khayyám]] Scout Park, near the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] and [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] borders. The [[Asia-Pacific Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement)#Regional Scout Jamboree|Second Asia-Pacific Jamboree]] was held at the site in preparation, in the summer of 1977. However, the destabilizing events of the [[Islamic Revolution]] caused the 15th World Jamboree to be cancelled near the end of 1978. Instead, the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] announced the "World Jamboree Year" by holding several international World Jamboree Year camps in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]] that took up the momentum. However, a number of commemorative items had already been made for the event, the demand for which and the value of which was greatly inflated by the Jamboree's cancellation. The few items of memorabilia in existence are of huge value to collectors when they, albeit rarely, come on the market.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

The next Jamboree, hosted by Canada in 1983, was named ''The Spirit Lives On'' to show how Scouting's spirit of international brotherhood could overcome the setback of cancelling the 1979 Jamboree.

[[File:Victims of Abu Sleem massacre.JPG|thumb|People at a Benghazi rally looking at the photos of victims of Abu Salim prison massacre (February 2011)]]
'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human rights abuses==
[[Amnesty International]] has called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996,&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |title=Investigation needed into prison deaths |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317043628/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |archivedate=2015-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident which some have referred to as the '''Abu Salim prison massacre'''.&lt;ref name="court celebrates massacre"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|title=Libyan legal court celebrates Abu Salim prison massacre|publisher=[[Arabic News]]|date=24 June 2005|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227211022/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|archive-date=2011-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a "site of egregious [[human rights violations]]."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=  Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=  [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmates of Abu Salim prison==
*[[Ahmed al-Senussi]], a current member of the NTC, was held here by Gaddafi until his release in 2001.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |last=Stock |first=Johnathan |title=Gaddafi-Opfer Al-Senussi: Gott entscheidet, was mit dir passiert |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |accessdate=25 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=13 March 2011 |agency=SPIEGEL-Verlag |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DGwSOUj?url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |archivedate=2011-08-25 |language=German |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

==Libyan civil war==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=RAW,Libya, Rebels and citizens setting prisoners free from Abu Salim Priso in Tripoli 24.08.2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHy2jmVocQ |work=[[YouTube]] |author=FreePressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter [[Matthew VanDyke]] from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in [[Brega]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=American fighting Kadhafi 'lunatics' dreams of free Libya |first=Jay|last=Deshmukh |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 October 2011 |work=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggq9gizU50QT6TMAe6WPD-7Xytrw?docId=CNG.63f3ecd569de01fd9d60c41e9a017daa.931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/25/libya.freed.american/|title = American held in solitary escapes Tripoli prison|author = Phil Gast|work = CNN|date =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a "writer and journalist," but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN" /&gt;

Generally speaking, a '''calendar year''' begins on the [[New Year's Day]] of the given [[calendar]] system and ends on the day before the following New Year's Day, and thus consists of a whole number of days. A year can also be measured by starting on any other named day of the calendar, and ending on the day before this named day in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calendar%20year | title=calendar year | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be termed a "year's time", but not a "calendar year".  To reconcile the calendar year with the astronomical cycle (which has a fractional number of days) certain years contain [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra days]] ("leap days" or "intercalary days").

The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year, which is in use in most of the world, begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. It has a length of 365 days in an [[common year|ordinary year]], with 8,760 hours, 525,600 minutes, or 31,536,000 seconds; but 366 days in a [[leap year]], with 8,784 hours, 527,040 minutes, or 31,622,400 seconds. With 97 leap years every 400 years, the year has an average length of 365.2425 days. Other formula-based calendars can have lengths which are further out of step with the solar cycle: for example, the [[Julian calendar]] has an average length of 365.25 days, and the [[Hebrew calendar]] has an average length of 365.2468 days. The [[Islamic calendar]] is a [[lunar calendar]] consisting of 12 [[lunar month|months]] in a year of 354 or 355 days.

The astronomer's [[mean tropical year]], which is averaged over equinoxes and solstices, is currently 365.24219 days, slightly shorter than the average length of the year in most calendars, but the astronomer's value changes over time, so [[William Herschel]]'s suggested correction to the Gregorian calendar may become unnecessary by the year 4000.

==Quarters==
The calendar year can be divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

* First quarter, Q1: 1 January – 31 March (90 days or 91 days in leap years)
* Second quarter, Q2: 1 April – 30 June (91 days)
* Third quarter, Q3: 1 July – 30 September (92 days)
* Fourth quarter, Q4: 1 October – 31 December (92 days)

When combined with a year, the quarter/year combination may be written, for example, as Q4{{CURRENTYEAR}} or 4Q{{CURRENTYEAR}} or {{CURRENTYEAR}}Q4.

==Marriage to John McCain==
{{See also|Early life and military career of John McCain}}

=== Marriage and family ===
Shepp met John McCain again when he was stationed at the Naval Air Basic Training Command at Pensacola in 1964, and after her divorce from Swanson, the two began dating.&lt;ref name="timberg-68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alexander-32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo100608"/&gt;   Her future husband frequently took training flights from Florida up to Philadelphia to see her on weekends.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

On July 3, 1965, Shepp and McCain married in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="dmr-mccain"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=caucus&amp;template=detail&amp;candidate=mccain |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090213090634/http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=caucus&amp;template=detail&amp;candidate=mccain |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |title=John McCain |6=&lt;!--work=Iowa Caucuses '08--&gt; |newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]] |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony was held at the home of the family that owned the well-known [[Old Original Bookbinder's]] seafood restaurant in Philadelphia; one of the Bookbinder family members was a close friend of Shepp from college.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

Following the wedding, McCain's new husband adopted her two children.&lt;ref name="timberg-70"/&gt; Together, they had a daughter, Sidney, born in September 1966.&lt;ref name="nyt122707"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/27/us/politics/27mccainkids.html |title=Bridging 4 Decades, a Large, Close-Knit Brood |author=Steinhauer, Jennifer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2007 |accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apart during Vietnam War ===
John McCain was shot down over [[North Vietnam]] on October 26, 1967; he would remain a [[prisoner of war]] for five and a half years.&lt;ref name="az-pow"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter3.html |title=John McCain Report: Prisoner of War|author=Nowicki, Dan &amp; [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her husband's captivity, McCain raised their children in [[Orange Park, Florida]], with the assistance of friends and neighbors in the Navy-oriented community.&lt;ref name="spt072008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article708671.ece | title=John McCain: From Orange Park to White House? | author=Leary, Alex | newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | date=July 20, 2008 | accessdate=July 21, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721145501/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article708671.ece | archive-date=July 21, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She sent frequent letters and packages to him,&lt;ref name="spt072008" /&gt; few of which the North Vietnamese let through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McCain | first=John | authorlink=John McCain |author2=[[Mark Salter]]  | title=[[Faith of My Fathers]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | year=1999 |location=New York | isbn=0-375-50191-6}} p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  She became active in the POW/MIA movement,&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; while those around her wore [[POW bracelet]]s with her husband's name and capture date engraved on them.&lt;ref name="spt072008" /&gt;

While visiting family and friends in the Philadelphia area on [[Christmas Eve]] 1969, McCain skidded and crashed into a telephone pole as she was navigating an icy, snowy, isolated portion of [[Pennsylvania Route 320]] near [[Gulph Mills, Pennsylvania]], driving alone.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt; She was thrown from her car into the snow, going into [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]];&lt;ref name="timberg-100"/&gt; she thought she would never be seen and would die there.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;  Hours later she was found and taken to [[Bryn Mawr Hospital]].&lt;ref name="timberg-100"/&gt;  She suffered two smashed legs, a [[broken pelvis]], broken arm, and a [[ruptured spleen]].&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;  She spent six months in the hospital and underwent 23 operations over the following two years in order to rebuild her legs with rods and pins, and had extensive [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt;&lt;ref name="az-return"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter4.html |title=John McCain Report: Back in the USA |author=Nowicki, Dan and [[Bill Muller|Muller, Bill]] |newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]] |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time her daughter stayed with her parents in Landsdowne while her sons stayed with friends in Florida.&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

McCain did not tell her husband about the accident in her letters, believing he already had enough to worry about.&lt;ref name="timberg-100" /&gt; The [[U.S. State Department]] contacted her surgeon the next day with a warning; as the doctor later said: {{cquote|They told me [the person I had operated on] was Carol McCain, her husband is a prisoner of war in Hanoi, and her father-in-law [is] supreme commander of the Pacific Fleet.

In April 1979, John McCain began a relationship with [[Cindy Hensley|Cindy Lou Hensley]], an [[Arizona]] special education teacher and [[Hensley &amp; Co.]] heiress.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; McCain's  husband pushed to end their marriage, and friends described her as being in shock.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; The McCains stopped cohabitating in January 1980; he filed for divorce in February 1980,&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; which she accepted.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt; When asked by a friend what had gone wrong, she said, "It's just one of those things."&lt;ref name="Kristof"/&gt; The uncontested divorce became official in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida|Fort Walton Beach]] on April 2, 1980.&lt;ref name="alexander-92"&gt;Alexander, ''Man of the People'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ex-husband would later state that he felt the demise of his marriage was due to his "selfishness and immaturity more than it was to Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine."&lt;ref name="az-arizona" /&gt;  Regarding her divorce, McCain said, "The breakup of our marriage was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or any of those things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else."&lt;ref name="az-arizona" /&gt; John McCain's biographer [[Robert Timberg]] wrote, however, "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on."&lt;ref name="timberg-125"&gt;Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Perot gave his own assessment of the McCain divorce: "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [Carol McCain] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [Cindy McCain] and the rest is history."&lt;ref name="limp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827/ |title=When Ross Perot Calls... |author=Alter, Jonathan |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610071832/http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827/ |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |authorlink=Jonathan Alter |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}  By the time Perot's statement was made, Perot had run into severe conflict with McCain's soon-to-be ex-husband over the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|Vietnam POW/MIA live prisoners issue]].&lt;/ref&gt; McCain's three children were initially upset with their father about the divorce, but later reconciled with him.&lt;ref name="Kristof" /&gt;

=== Amicable relations ===
The divorce settlement afforded McCain full custody of her three children as well as alimony, child support, college tuition for their children, houses in Virginia and Florida, and lifelong financial support for her continuing medical treatment.&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt; She was sued by her former mother-in-law, [[Roberta McCain]], in 1980 for return of personal property, with the suit settled out of court in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCrgwr3DzPfUx8LnNRNv52h4KgLwD92JA7G00| title=McCain and his mother don't recall old lawsuits | author=Barakat, Matthew | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=August 16, 2008 | accessdate=August 22, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the divorce, McCain remained on good terms with her ex-husband,&lt;ref name="az-arizona" /&gt; supporting him in his subsequent political campaigns. She refused to discuss her marriage with an election opponent of her ex-husband's in 1982 who was seeking negative information about him, telling the opponent that "a gentleman never would have called."&lt;ref name="wapo030200" /&gt; During his [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], McCain said of her former husband: "He's a good guy. We are still good friends. He is the best man for president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carol McCain |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/carol-mccain/ |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |accessdate=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent career==

=== Reagan campaign and administration ===
McCain moved to [[La Mesa, California]], where she lived for several months with the family of top Reagan associate [[Edwin Meese]].&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; She became a personal assistant to [[Nancy Reagan]] in the fall of 1979, working with her as a press assistant on [[United States presidential election, 1980|Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign]],&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt; and then worked on the [[1980 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; She was director of the 1981 Reagan [[inaugural ball]],&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt; and as the Reagan administration began, she handled scheduling for the First Lady and the Reagan children.&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt;

In 1981 she became Director of the [[White House Visitors Office]].&lt;ref name="nyt083081"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/us/white-house-tour-leader-courted-and-criticized.html?sec=travel | title=White House Tour Leader Courted and Criticized | author=Gamarekian, Barbara  | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=August 30, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she planned tours and dealt with the pleas of different groups for the limited slots available.&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; She also dealt with demands from Washington officials, including a dispute about tour slots between Nancy Reagan and [[New York (state)|New York]] Congressman [[Thomas Downey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/nyregion/truce-of-sorts-on-white-house-tours.html | title=Truce, Of Sorts, On White House Tours | author=Weisman, Steven R | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=June 20, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the pressures of her job, she said cheerfully, "I'm always in tears, but I love the job. I'm really having a ball."&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; During the [[early 1980s recession]], she declared that the White House tours were fully booked even when other Washington attractions saw declining attendance; her office processed well over one million visits a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/02/us/white-house-remains-ever-popular.html | title=White House Remains Ever Popular | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=September 2, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a well-liked presence on the Washington social scene.&lt;ref name="nyt101708c"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/us/politics/18cindy.html | title=Behind McCain, Outsider in Capital Wanting Back In |author1=Kantor, Jodi  |author2=Halbfinger, David M. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=October 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1981 and 1986, she greatly expanded the annual [[White House Easter Egg Roll]], adding participatory activities and doubling the size of the crowds attending.&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt; The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' likened her "extravaganza-loving" event style to that of [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt; She was also involved in planning [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]] [[State Arrival Ceremony|State Arrival Ceremonies]],&lt;ref name="nyt083081" /&gt; as well as a national [[Christmas]] celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB29BE9A1C8620C&amp;p_docnum=3&amp; | title=O'Neill is Weighing an Invitation For Post as Bicentennial Spokesman | author=Naedele, Walter F | publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' | date=November 18, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private sector ===
She left the White House Visitors Office position in January 1987 to join [[Philadelphia]]-based We the People 200, Inc., which was the organization planning the celebration for the 200th anniversary of the [[United States Constitution]] that year.&lt;ref name="wapo123086" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pi021987"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB29C3F6146FFAA&amp;p_docnum=2 | title=Bicentennial Group Adds, Loses Staff | author=Naedele, Walter F | publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' | date=February 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named programming director, part of We the People 200's senior management team.&lt;ref name="pi021987" /&gt; The bicentennial project was already troubled by lack of corporate financial sponsorship and persistent internal conflicts; the high salaries of McCain and other senior staff came under some criticism, but were defended by the organization's president as justified based upon age and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI%7CDN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29987C60F7ED5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D | title=Painting the Town with Red Ink: Inadequate Funding, Internal Conflict Crippling Fete | author=Flander, Scott | publisher=''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' | date=February 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, she was a spokesperson for Washington, Inc., a large [[event planning]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72633871.html?dids=72633871:72633871&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Dec+6%2C+1990&amp;author=Patricia+Dane+Rogers&amp;desc=Entertaining%3B+Setting+a+Simpler+Tone+In+Uncertain+Times | title=Entertaining: Setting a Simpler Tone In Uncertain Times | author=Rogers, Patricia Dane | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 6, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1991, she was a spokesperson for the Desert Storm Homecoming Foundation, which held a $12 million victory celebration and memorial in Washington in June 1991 following the conclusion of the [[Gulf War]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74689393.html?dids=74689393:74689393&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Jun+6%2C+1991&amp;author=Sue+Anne+Pressley&amp;desc=Desert+Storm+Celebration+Is+Also+a+Parade+of+Tears%3B+Day+Will+Be+Painful+for+Families+of+War+Dead | title=Desert Storm Celebration Is Also a Parade of Tears; Day Will Be Painful for Families of War Dead | author=Pressley, Sue Ann | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=June 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74689431.html?dids=74689431:74689431&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Jun+7%2C+1991&amp;author=Mary+Jordan&amp;desc=Victory+Party+Storms+Into+Town%3BMilitary+Invades+Mall+for+Extravaganza+Now+Priced+at+%2412+Million | title=Victory Party Storms Into Town;Military Invades Mall for Extravaganza Now Priced at $12 Million | author=Jordan, Mary | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=June 7, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She later worked in [[press relations]] for the [[National Soft Drink Association]] in Washington.&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo030200"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/50640248.html?dids=50640248:50640248&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Mar+2%2C+2000&amp;author=Lois+Romano&amp;desc=Out+of+the+Fire%2C+Politics+Calls%3B+Ex-POW+Turns+Washington+Insider | title=Out of the Fire, Politics Calls; Ex-POW Turns Washington Insider | author=Romano, Lois | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=March 2, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, McCain retired and moved to a [[bungalow]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]].&lt;ref name="lat071108" /&gt; While she has had romantic relationships since her divorce, McCain has not remarried.  A friend of the family, who was interviewed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2008, recounted McCain's reasoning why she never remarried: "She had a lot of boyfriends. She was going out with one fellow who was so terrific. And I said: 'He's so in love with you. You'll have a terrific life together.' She said, 'No, I don't think so.' She's never fallen in love with anyone else. [John McCain] was a hard act to follow."&lt;ref name="wapo100608" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philastory"/&gt;

'''Catastrophism''' was the theory that the [[Earth]] had largely been shaped by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turney |first=C.S.M. |last2=Brown |first2=H. |year=2007 |title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe |journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=26 |pages=2036–2041 |bibcode= 2007QSRv...26.2036T |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] (sometimes described as [[gradualism]]), in which slow incremental changes, such as [[erosion]], created all the Earth's [[geology|geological]] features. Uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as [[erosion]]) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the [[scientific consensus]] accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur.

Catastrophism held that [[geological epoch]]s had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid [[orogeny|formation of major mountain chains]].  Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were [[extinction|made extinct]], being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of [[Noah's flood]].

The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist [[Georges Cuvier]], who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided  religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="McG 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133" /&gt;

==History==

===Geology and biblical beliefs===
{{Main article|history of geology}}
In the early development of [[geology]], efforts were made in a predominantly [[Christian]] western society to reconcile biblical narratives of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] and the [[Universal Flood Myth#Jewish|universal flood]] with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was "stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the [[Greeks]]", an example being [[Plutarch]]'s account of the [[Universal Flood Myth#Ogyges|Ogygian flood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvardnb|King|1877|p=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuvier and the natural theologians===
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French [[anatomist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Georges Cuvier]]. His motivation was to explain the patterns of [[extinction]] and [[faunal succession]] that he and others were observing in the [[fossil]] record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to [[Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="McG 3"&gt;{{Harvardnb|McGowan|2001|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the intellectual climate of the [[French revolution]], avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings.&lt;ref name="Rudwick 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuvier also believed that the [[stratigraphic]] record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast in Britain, where [[natural theology]] was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including [[William Buckland]] and [[Robert Jameson]] interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title ''Theory of the Earth''. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Buckland abandoned [[flood geology]] in favor of the [[glaciation]] theory advocated by [[Louis Agassiz]], following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of uniformitarianism in geology===
Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of [[sedimentary rock]] and an understanding of the immense stretch of [[geological time]], or as the concept came to be known [[deep time]], were found in the writing of [[James Hutton]], sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist [[Charles Lyell]] built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] ("The present is the key to the past") and [[gradualism]] (''geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time'') and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with [[religion]] and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered [[Miracle|miraculous]] rather than natural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1972|pp=174–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 [[J Harlen Bretz]] published a paper on the [[channeled scablands]] formed by glacial [[Lake Missoula]] in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the [[Penrose Medal]]; the [[Geological Society of America]]'s highest award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/awards/past.htm Penrose Medal 1979] to J Harlen Bretz, [[Geological Society of America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Velikovsky's views===
{{Main|Velikovskyism}}
In the 1950s, [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet [[Venus]] is a former "[[comet]]" which was ejected from [[Jupiter]] and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current [[orbit]]. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical [[Ten Plagues|plague]]s of [[Egypt]], the biblical reference to the "Sun standing still" for a day (Joshua 10:12 &amp; 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of [[Atlantis]]. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures.&lt;ref name="UnMuseum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krystek |first1=Lee |title=Venus in the Corner Pocket: The Controversial Theories of Immanuel Velikovsky |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/velikov.htm |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current application==
Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goudie |first1=A. |year= |title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |page=709 |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] in 1980. This paper suggested that a {{convert|10|km|mi}} [[asteroid]] [[Impact event|struck Earth]] 66 million years ago at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the [[dinosaur]]s, leaving behind the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–T boundary). In 1990, a {{convert|180|km|mi}} candidate crater marking the impact was identified at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] of [[Mexico]].

Since then, the debate about the [[extinction]] of the dinosaurs and other [[mass extinction]] events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature.

The observation of the [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events.

===Comparison with uniformitarianism===
One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |year=2007 |chapter=Uniformitarianism |chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |title=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=6th |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624122338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/un/uniformi.html |archivedate=2006-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moon-formation===
{{Main|Giant impact theory}}
Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large [[moon]] was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in ''Icarus'' in 1975, [[William K. Hartmann]] and [[Donald R. Davis]] proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large [[planetesimal]] early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the [[Moon]], thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Gott III |first=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

In most instances, the effect is a rather negative one as it has disrupted many Africans’ traditional norms and practices. For instance, many West African communities rely on [[Traditional African medicine|traditional healers]] and [[witch doctors]], who use herbal remedies, massage, chant, and witchcraft to cure just about any ailment.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4216-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-3-july-2014.html|title=Ebola virus disease, West Africa – update 3 July 2014|publisher=WHO|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |title=West African Cultural Norms/Traditions That May Impact Ebola Transmission |publisher=HCA |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109123732/http://wesleymc.com/util/documents/TraditionsThatMayImpactEbolaTransmission.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is difficult for West Africans to adapt to foreign medical practices. Specifically, West African resistance to Western medicine is prominent in the region, which calls for severe distrust of Western and modern medical personnel and practices.{{small|(see [[Cultural effects of the Ebola crisis#Ebola conspiracies|Ebola conspiracies]] below.)}}&lt;ref name=Gassel&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publichealth.tufts.edu/About-Us/Public-Health-Rounds-Newsletter/How-Cultural-Norms-and-Practices-Impact-Ebola-OutbreakPage |title=How Cultural Norms and Practices Impact Ebola Outbreak |author= Sammi Gassel&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Tufts University |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, some African cultures have a traditional [[solidarity]] of standing by the sick, which is contrary to the safe care of an Ebola patient.&lt;ref name="afro.who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; This tradition is known as "standing by the ill" in order to show one's respect and honor to the patient. According to the Wesley Medical Center, these sorts of traditional norms can be dangerous to those not infected with the virus as it increases their chances of coming in contract with their family member's bodily fluids.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; In [[Liberia]], Ebola has wiped out entire families, leaving perhaps one survivor to recount stories of how they simply could not be hands off while their loved ones were sick in bed, because of their culture of touch, hold, hug and kiss.&lt;ref name="nyt20141005"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/africa/ebolas-cultural-casualty-hugs-in-hands-on-liberia.html|title=Ebola’s Cultural Casualty: Hugs in Hands-On Liberia|publisher=The New York Times|first=Helene|last=Cooper|date=4 October 2014|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communities traditionally use [[folklore]] and mythical literature, which is often passed on verbally from one generation to the next to explain the interrelationships of all things that exist. However the folklore and songs are not only of traditional or ancient historical origins, but are often about current events that have affected the community. Additionally, folklore and music will often take opposing sides of any story. Thus early in the Ebola epidemic, the song "White Ebola" was released by a [[diaspora]] based group and centers on the general distrust of "outsiders" who may be intentionally infecting people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m11/background.php|title=A brief background and history of African literatures|publisher=Exploring Africa|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culanth592"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/592-beats-rhymes-and-ebola|title=Beats, Rhymes and Ebola|publisher=Boima Tucker|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This initial misinformation increased the general distrust in foreigners, and the idea that Ebola was not in Africa before their arrival led to attacks on many health workers as well as blockages of aid convoys blocked from checking remote areas. A burial team, which was sent in to collect the bodies of suspected Ebola victims from [[West Point, Monrovia|West Point]] in Liberia, was blocked by several hundred residents chanting: "No Ebola in West Point." Health ministries and workers started an aggressive Ebola information campaign on all media formats to properly inform the residents and allow aid workers safe access to the high risk areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-workers-battle-trust-issues-attacks-in-ebola-outbreak/|title=Health workers battle trust issues, attacks in Ebola outbreak|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-armed-men-attack-liberia-ebola-clinic-freeing-patients/|title=Report: Armed men attack Liberia Ebola clinic, freeing patients|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Guinea]], riots broke out after medics disinfected a market in [[Nzerekore]]. Locals rumored that the medics were actually spreading the disease. In nearby [[Massacre at Womey|Womey]], 8 people distributing information about Ebola were killed by the villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29256443|title=Ebola outbreak: Guinea health team killed|publisher=BBC News|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== West African cultural traditions and norms==
[[File:Response volunteers in Nigeria.jpg|thumb|right|Volunteers distribute health information in Nigeria.]]
The Ebola epidemic of 2014 has forced West Africans to face numerous difficulties on daily basis regarding their traditional norms and practices. In essence, their traditions have been severely disrupted due to the [[Ebola virus]]. For instance, Africans have had the tendency to remain close to their sick family members to nurse them during illness for centuries. Unfortunately for the African community, many have been encouraged to keep their distance from their infected family members as potential contact could be fatal. In addition, it is part of their culture to touch the deceased at funerals and for the sister of the deceased’s father to bathe, clean, and dress the corpse in a favorite outfit. When there is not an aunt to perform this task, a female elder in their community is then held responsible. Not only is it customary to wash and touch the deceased, but also to kiss those that have passed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Specifically, funerals are considered to be major cultural events for families and friends to gather around to celebrate the deceased. The funeral performances, which involve wailing and dancing, is done out of care and respect for the dead. Funerals in Africa often last for several days, depending on the status of the person who died. In other words, the more important the person who died was while they were alive, the longer the mourning will last. More importantly, there is a common bowl used for ritual hand-washing towards the end of the ceremony, including a final kiss or touch on the face, which is to be bestowed on the dead. This is commonly referred to as a "love touch."  The [[Wesley Medical Center]] has confirmed that prohibiting African families from performing such rites is a disgrace as it insults the deceased, putting the remaining family in danger. Specifically, it is believed that the dead person’s spirit, also known as "tibo," will cause harm and bring illness to the family as a result of an improper burial.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;

===Resistance to Western medicine===
Resistance to Western medicine is considered to be a significant barrier to battling the Ebola virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; The Wesley Medical Center claims that the interference with African burial rituals caused by Western medical practices has prohibited them from properly honoring their loved ones.  They believe that this may have been a reason for heightened distrust in medical professionals, and that the mistrust enhances each time family members of infected persons are prohibited from participating in the funeral or seeing the dead body in person.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Due to the mistrust Ebola-stricken communities in Liberia reportedly hid family members with Ebola from health care providers and held secret burials.&lt;ref name=Ravi&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sociocultural Dimensions of the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in Liberia|url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|journal = Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science|date = 2014-10-23|issn = 1538-7135|pages = 301–305|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1089/bsp.2014.1002|first = Sanjana J.|last = Ravi|first2 = Eric M.|last2 = Gauldin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sierra Leone health workers made more progress because health measures were implemented according to WHO guidance, which advises health workers to heed the traditions of the threatened communities when attending to the dead. Therefore, funerals were held in agreement with the wishes of the families, but also gave health workers an opportunity to disinfect the bodies.&lt;ref name=Ravi/&gt; In many of the Ebola infected areas in Africa, Western medicine is also believed either to be ineffective or to be the actual origin of the virus. In other words, there is a belief among the African community that Western doctors are intentionally killing their patients with their treatments. A conspiracy theory also says that the medical professionals are planning to harvest the organs of those dying from Ebola.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

Resistance to Western medicine exists also because of the look of the hazmat suits, which are worn by healthcare workers to protect themselves from becoming infected with the Ebola virus.  The protective equipment is said to frighten many West Africans and also believed to be hostile and intimidating to the African families.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt; Lastly, the interference in the family’s care for the patient diminishes the honor of the patient as well as hindering the family’s duty to provide comfort and care.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Regardless of the existing resistance towards Western medicine, handling the bodies of the deceased poses a high risk of contagion as Ebola is contracted through physical contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. This is mainly because preparation for burial includes touching, washing, and kissing as is mentioned above. Those that are preparing for the funeral can become easily infected as they can easily become exposed to the infected person’s blood, vomit, diarrhea, and other bodily fluids as these are the main symptoms of the virus.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

===Traditional medical practices===
Apart from the fact that traditional African healers have been using ritual and herbal remedies for many centuries, the African people also trust these treatments and find the costs more affordable. Traditional procedures include the following:  magic, biomedical methods, fasting, dieting, herbal therapies, bathing, massage, as well as surgery. Surgical procedures often involve cutting a patient’s skin with unsterilized knives.   Sometimes, traditional healers apply blood to the skin to rid them of their sickness.&lt;ref name="wesleymc.com"/&gt; Despite the severe distrust of Africans in modern medicine, the Ebola virus has been said to spread rampantly across West Africa due to a shortage of healthcare workers and limited medical resources and facilities. The unsanitary conditions in the overall African region have also made it easier for Ebola to spread.&lt;ref name=Gassel/&gt;

== Personal account of a West African student==

Alakey Osei, a student and bank-teller from [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], described the Sierra Leonean capital as a ghost-town, as a result of the increasing death toll in the [[West Africa]]n region caused by the [[Ebola epidemic]].  Osei states that "everyone is scared to be out of their houses. No one is going to church or mosque, no one is going to work, the kids are not going to school, [and] people are not even going to the market place".  The fact that the city of Freetown has been completely abandoned is foreign to the student, because the nation is and has always been heavily reliant on physical contact and very close interaction. Osei has indicated that following the no touching rule that the medical personnel have been promoting is extremely difficult for her. Osei continues by saying that she does not even know how her people are surviving.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In her interview, Osei provides some insight about her childhood. She moved to US in 2008 when she was thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to [[American culture]] and simply for being the "uncivilized" African.  For example, others had asked her if she was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe that American culture was very cold. She also noticed that Americans were "protective of their property", space, and time. She concluded that American society is "extremely individualistic". This truly made her miss living in Africa, "... where every woman is your mother and every man is your father, ... where you are never alone, because everyone is family and family is all around you".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As of October 2014, the Ebola virus had not reached her home-town back in Sierra Leone; however, she said that her family still living in the country claimed that Freetown did not "feel like the same place" anymore. Her aunt had told her that people were not sharing food anymore nor spending time at each other's houses as they used to because of the fear of becoming infected. Osei finds it heart-breaking that people in Sierra Leone have turned to isolation as a way to stay Ebola-free. Osei now says that "Freetown has become Fear-town", and that "Ebola has turned us into prisoners in our own country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_ccf50fda-4f0a-11e4-858f-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Student from Sierra Leone tells of cultural impact of Ebola |author=Rosemond Crown&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 8, 2014 |website=Hilltop Views |publisher=Hilltop Views |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bushmeat==
The Ebola virus, for which the primary host is suspected to be [[Megabat|fruit bats]], has been linked to [[bushmeat]], which is commonly consumed in areas of West Africa that use it as a protein source.

Despite health organisations warning about risks of bushmeat, surveys pre-dating the 2014 outbreak indicate that people who eat bushmeat are usually unaware of the risks and view it as healthy food. Because of bushmeat's role as a protein source in Western Africa, it is traditionally associated with good nutrition, and efforts to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat have been impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/239123/icode/|title=FAO warns of fruit bat risk in West African Ebola epidemic|work=FAO|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 30 and 80 percent of protein intake in rural households in Central Africa comes from wild meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_151010.html|title=Bushmeat consumption, wildlife trade and global public health risks|work=FAO|date=15 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ebola conspiracies ==
* The ''[[Liberian Observer]]'', a major Liberian newspaper, has repeatedly published Ebola-related conspiracy theories. In September 2014 it published an article claiming that Ebola and the [[HIV|AIDS virus]] are [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] to be used as [[Biological warfare|bio-weapons]] on Africans in an attempt to reduce Africa’s population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/security/ebola-aids-manufactured-western-pharmaceuticals-us-dod|title=Ebola, AIDS Manufactured by Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/17/the-major-liberian-newspaper-churning-out-ebola-conspiracy-after-conspiracy/  "The major Liberian newspaper churning out Ebola conspiracy after conspiracy", [[The Washington Post]], Terrence McCoy, October 17, 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; In October the story went viral on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2014/10/28/Is-the-US-manufacturing-the-Ebola-virus-with-HIV|title=Claims of US manufacturing Ebola with HIV go viral|author=Jean-Jacques Cornish|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa developed in 2014, a number of popular self-published and well-reviewed books containing sensational and misleading information about the disease appeared in electronic and printed formats. The authors of some such books admitted that they lacked medical credentials and were not technically qualified to give medical advice. The World Health Organization and the United Nations stated that such misinformation had contributed to the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewey|first=Caitlin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/02/popular-on-amazon-wildly-misleading-self-published-books-about-ebola-by-random-people-without-medical-degrees/|title=Popular on Amazon: Wildly misleading self-published books about Ebola, by random people without medical degrees|date=2 October 2014|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Liberia, some body-collection teams dispatched to collect the Ebola dead have collected bribes to issue falsified death certificates to family members, stating that their dead relative did not die from Ebola. The body of the Ebola victim would also be left with relatives. Ebola carries a stigma in Liberia, and some families do not want to admit that their relative died of Ebola. Another factor is that families wish to give their relative a traditional burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-ebola-stricken-african-families-pay-bribes-for-fake-death-records-1413153854|title=Some Ebola-Stricken African Families Pay Bribes for Fake Death Records|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|first=Heidi|last=Vogt|date=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late October 2014 it was reported that harassment of gay Liberians in Monrovia was occurring after some church leaders said that "God was angry with Liberians over corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality, and that Ebola was a punishment". The harassment included car windows being smashed and some gay people were forced from their homes and had to go into hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-foundation-ebola-liberia-gay-idUSKCN0IC1GV20141023?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews|title= "Gay community under attack in Liberia over Ebola outbreak", Reuters, Misha Hussain and Maria Caspani, October 23, 2014.|work=Reuters|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==

There are a number of Ebola-themed jokes circulating in West Africa to spread awareness.&lt;ref name="Bloom20140827"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-27/tell-me-the-one-about-ebola-how-jokes-spread-awareness.html|title=Tell Me the One About Ebola: How Jokes Spread Awareness|publisher=Bloomberg|author1=Pauline Bax|author2=Makiko Kitamura|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Liberian Football Association made an announcement that all soccer related activities would be put on hold "''indefinitely to protect players and fans''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28542577|title=Ebola outbreak: Liberia suspends football|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=29 July 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, in a joint venture between [[FIFA]] and [[WHO]], the [[Antoinette Tubman Stadium]] was converted into an Ebola treatment center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-12/monrovia-soccer-stadium-to-house-ebola-centre-fifa/5738710|title=Ebola outbreak: Soccer stadium in Liberia to be converted to virus treatment centre, FIFA says|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[African Cup of Nations]] (AFCON) was temporarily put on hold when the original hosts, [[Morocco]], asked the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF) to postpone the final games till 2016, due to the Ebola outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30004279|title=Africa Cup of Nations: Morocco will not host finals over Ebola fears|publisher=BBC|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAF eventually moved the finals to [[Equatorial Guinea]], which eliminated Morocco from the game as hosts, and brought Equatorial Guinea in, even though they had been eliminated prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30053859|title=2015 Nations Cup: Equatorial Guinea to host tournament|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the qualifiers for 2015 AFCON have been influenced by many countries' fear of Ebola, with many refusing to enter or allow entry of teams from affected countries. In July 2014, [[Seychelles]] refused entry to the Sierra Leone team. CAF ruled that Seychelles forfeited the game, giving Sierra Leone an automatic pass to the next stage. [[Lesotho]] refused to send the [[African Youth Championship|Under-20]] team to [[Nigeria]]. CAF again ruled that Lesotho forfeited the game, sending Nigeria through to the finals.&lt;ref name="f24201408"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140824-african-football-struggles-play-amid-ebola-outbreak-cup-of-nations/|title=African football in disarray amid Ebola outbreak|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, CAF also decided to forbid any official games in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. For Liberia, who had already been eliminated, this was not of concern.&lt;ref name="f24201408" /&gt; Sierra Leone managed to move some home games to the visiting teams home; both home and away games against [[DR Congo]] were played in [[Lubumbashi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28995543|title=Sierra Leone move Afcon tie with DR Congo to Lubumbashi|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=30 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both games against [[Cameroon]] were played in [[Yaounde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29330276|title=Nations Cup 2015: Cameroon and Sierra Leone find venues|publisher=BBC|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea managed to get their home games moved to [[Casablanca]], Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28844477|title=Guinea move Togo 2015 Nations Cup qualifier to Morocco|publisher=BBC|date=18 August 2014|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after calls to have the 2015 AFCON postponed, the Equatorial Guinea government and CAF organisers have downplayed these concerns, and insisted that they would have ample measures in place, including: {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*Temperature check for all passengers arriving at the international airports.

On 7 August 2014 a social media hoax message was doing the rounds in [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa#Nigeria|Nigeria]]. It urged readers to "''bath with hot water and salt before daybreak''" and to drink as much of it as possible. On 8 August the person who started the joke message to see how many of their friends would fall for it, identified it as such and posted an apology.&lt;ref name="dt17323"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/notes-from-atlanta/17323-understanding-how-the-salt-and-water-ebola-cure-hoax-spread-in-nigeria|title=Understanding how the salt-and-water Ebola cure hoax spread in Nigeria|publisher=Media Trust Limited|first=Farooq|last=Kperogi|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoax-slayer.com/salt-water-ebola-remedy-hoax.shtml|title=Salt Water Ebola Prevention Hoax Leads to Deaths|publisher=hoax slayer|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax message quickly went viral when "''several gullible, unsophisticated opinion leaders''" repeated the hoax message.&lt;ref name="dt17323" /&gt; Within days many were hospitalized due to excessive salt intake, with 2 deaths in [[Jos]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.view.com.ng/ebola-virus-two-die-after-drinking-salt-water-in-jos/|title=Ebola Virus, Two die after drinking salt water in Jos|publisher=View|author=Clems|date=9 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 deaths in [[Benué State|Makurdi, Benue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2014/08/14/ebola-two-nigerians-die-drinking-bathing-hot-salt-water/|title=Ebola: Two more Nigerians die drinking, bathing with hot salt water|publisher=Daily Post|first=Adenike|last=Orenuga|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 3 deaths in [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/four-feared-dead-intake-salt-water-bauchi/|title=Four feared dead after intake of salt water in Bauchi|publisher=Vanguard|first=Suzan|last=Edeh|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is ironic that these deaths all happened in states that had no known EVD infected people. In fact only [[Lagos State]] and [[Rivers State]] had any infected. Furthermore, the unconfirmed death toll of the hoax cure is as many as the EVD death toll for Nigeria, with 8 deaths each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135600/1/roadmapsitrep_1Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1|title=WHO: Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report|publisher=WHO|date=1 October 2014|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/weekly/index.php/features/17359-ebola-more-deaths-from-salt-therapy-than-virus|title=Ebola: More deaths from "salt therapy" than virus|publisher=Media Trust Limited|first=Onimisi|last=Alao|author2=Hassan Ibrahim|author3=Ahmed Mohammed|author4=Hope Abah|author5=Femi Akinola|author6=Lagos|author7=Judd-Leonard Okafor|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two separate incidents in October, flights have been delayed from disembarking because of an Ebola joke. On 8 October 2014, [[US Airways]] flight 845 from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Punta Cana]], [[Dominican Republic]] was held up for two hours on the tarmac when an American passenger sneezed, then announced "I have Ebola. You're all screwed," during the flight. After landing, he was escorted off the plane by four emergency personnel wearing blue [[hazmat suit]]s, and detained until medical tests cleared him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/10/355108686/ebola-joke-triggers-passengers-removal-from-us-airways-flight|title=Ebola Joke Triggers Passenger's Removal From US Airways Flight|publisher=NPR|first=Scott|last=Neuman|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2787292/Hazmat-team-rushed-meet-US-plane-Dominican-Republic-passenger-sneezed-yelled-I-Ebola-poor-taste-joke.html|title=What NOT to say on a plane: American passenger bundled off U.S. to Dominican Republic flight by hazmat team after sneezing and joking 'I have Ebola!'|publisher=Daily Mail|author=Mia De Graaf|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2014, during the [[Aer Lingus]] flight EI 433, from [[Milan]], [[Italy]] to [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] a passenger wrote "'Attenzione Ebola'" ("Attention Ebola") on a coffee lid before handing it to his daughter. The container and lid were discreetly disposed of, however a flight attendant noticed, and alerted the captain. The passenger was arrested, and later pleaded guilty to "engaging in threatening, abusive or insulting behavior on an airplane contrary to the [[Air Navigation and Transport Act]]", and was fined 2500 [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29845065|title=Man fined over Ebola joke on Dublin to Milan Aer Lingus flight|publisher=BBC|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/passenger-to-pay-2-500-over-sick-ebola-joke-on-dublin-plane-1.1983405?page=1|title=Passenger to pay €2,500 over ‘sick’ Ebola joke on Dublin plane|first=Tom|last=Tuite|publisher=THE IRISH TIMES|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus. Since then, Monn has been designing events for a wide variety of occasions.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gordon| first=Amanda| title =Authentic, Simple &amp; Refined: A Night With David Monn| newspaper =[[The New York Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =August 14, 2008 | url =http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/authentic-simple-refined-a-night-with-david-monn/83889/| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he managed the festivities for the grand opening of the [[Time Warner Center]]. The following year, Monn was responsible for the design of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's [[Costume Institute Gala]].&lt;ref name="NYTInf"&gt;{{cite news | last=Trebay| first=Guy| title =Influencers Are Forever| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =June 26, 2005 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/fashion/sundaystyles/influencers-are-forever.html| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, his clients included the Guggenheim Museum, [[LVMH]], and the [[Metropolitan Opera]] (among others).&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt; In November 2007, Monn designed the [[Frank Gehry]]-inspired Guggenheim International Gala at [[Pier 40 at Hudson River Park|Pier 40]].&lt;ref name="Bash"/&gt; He also designed the 100th anniversary celebration for the [[Plaza Hotel]] that year.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{cite news | last=Huguenin| first=Patrick| title =Event planner's the life of the party| newspaper =[[New York Daily News]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =December 15, 2007 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/event-planner-life-party-article-1.276028| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Monn designed the [[White House]] State Dinner honoring then [[Mexican President]] [[Felipe Calderón]].&lt;ref name="NYTShopping"/&gt; In November 2016, he released his book, ''David Monn: The Art of Celebrating'', which contains 360 pages of images and text about events he has planned and designed. The book's release date was marked with a party at the New York Public Library's main campus.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWD"/&gt; In January 2017, Monn designed an opening candlelight dinner for the inauguration festivities of President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="WP90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTTrump"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bernstein| first=Jacob| title =How Anna Wintour's Longtime Party Planner Turned to Trump| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =January 18, 2017 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/fashion/inauguration-donald-trump-stephanie-winston-wolkoff.html?_r=0| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earth Hour''' is a worldwide movement organized by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).  The event is held annually encouraging individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm on a specific day towards the end of March, as a symbol of commitment to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.earthhour.org/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started as a lights-off event in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], in 2007. Since then, it has grown to engage more than 7,000 cities and towns across 187 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/Earth_Hour_Report_2017.pdf|title=Earth Hour 2017 report|author=|first=|date=|website=www.earthhour.org|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, in years when [[Holy Saturday]] falls on the last Saturday of March, Earth Hour is moved a week early rather than its traditional date.

Earth Hour 2018 was on March 24, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm.

Earth Hour 2019 is scheduled for March 30, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/earthhour|title=Earth Hour (@earthhour) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Conception and start: 2004–2007===
In 2004, confronted with scientific findings, WWF Australia met with advertising agency [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett Sydney]] to "discuss ideas for engaging Australians on the issue of climate change".&lt;ref name="earthhour1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |title=history |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327103047/http://www.earthhour.org/page/media-centre/earth-hour-history |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a large scale switch off was coined and developed in 2006, originally under the working title "The Big Flick".  WWF Australia presented their concept to [[Fairfax Media]] who, along with Sydney Lord Mayor [[Clover Moore]], agreed to back the event.&lt;ref name="earthhour1"/&gt; The 2007 Earth Hour was held on March 31 in Sydney, Australia at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm, local time.

In October 2007 San Francisco ran its own "Lights Out" program inspired by the Sydney Earth Hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/19/local/me-lightsout19 |title= Hour leg of darkness | newspaper = [[LA Times]] | date = September 19, 2007| author = John M. Glionna}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their successful event in October, the organizers decided to rally behind the Earth Hour being planned for March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lightsoutsf.org/2007/10/24/moving-forward/ |title=Moving forward &amp;#124; Lights Out San Francisco |publisher=Lightsoutsf.org |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth Hour 2008 was held internationally on March 29, 2008 from 8&amp;nbsp;pm to 9&amp;nbsp;pm local time, marking the first anniversary of the event. 35 countries around the world participated as official flagship cities and over 400 cities also supported. Landmarks around the world turned off their non-essential lighting for Earth Hour. Some websites took part in the event, with Google's homepage going "dark" on the day .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cities Shut Lights for Earth Hour 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/03/29/world-cities-shut-lights-for-earth-hour-2008/|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Zogby International online survey, 36 million Americans—approximately 16 percent of the United States adult population—participated in Earth Hour 2008. The survey also showed there was a 4 percentage point increase in the level of interest in environmental issues such as climate change and pollution directly after the event (73 percent pre-event versus 77 percent post-event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/21/idUS134396+21-Apr-2008+BW20080421 | title = 36 Million Americans Take Part in World Wildlife Fund's Global 'Earth Hour' | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = April 28, 2008 | accessdate = 2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to WWF Thailand, [[Bangkok]] decreased electricity usage by 73.34 [[megawatts]], which, [[megawatt-hour|over one hour]], is equivalent to 41.6 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/03/29/earth-hour.html |title= Canadians go dark with world for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/bangkok-post/20080330/281500746965118 Bangkok Post]'' gave different figures of 165 [[megawatt-hours]] and 102 [[tonne]]s of [[carbon dioxide]]. This was noted to be significantly less than a similar campaign initiated by Bangkok's City Hall the previous year in May, when 530 megawatt-hours were saved and 143 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide emission]] were cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/30Mar2008_news03.php|title=Lights out campaign disappointing: Bangkok helps save very little energy |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30 |publisher=[[Bangkok Post]]}} {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippine Electricity Market Corp. noted that power consumption dropped by about 78.63 megawatts in [[Metro Manila]], and up to 102.2 megawatts on [[Luzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20080331-127542/Earth-Hour-made-dent-in-power-use |title=Earth Hour made dent in power use |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=March 31, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526020555/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20080331-127542/Earth-Hour-made-dent-in-power-use |archivedate=May 26, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum demand drop of around 39 MW was experienced at 8:14&amp;nbsp;pm in Metro Manila and of around 116&amp;nbsp;MW at 8:34&amp;nbsp;pm in the Luzon grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/theenvironmentreport/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20081211-177480 |title=WWF calls for 'lights out' event in 2009 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212211646/http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/theenvironmentreport/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20081211-177480 |archivedate=December 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario]] used approximately 900 megawatt-hours less electrical energy during Earth Hour. At one point, [[Toronto]] saw an 8.7% reduction in consumption as compared to a typical March Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/SpecialSections/EarthHour/article/407246 |title= Toronto hits energy target |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30 | first=Peter | last=Gorrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland, as a whole, had a reduction in electricity use of about 1.5% for the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0330/environment.html |title= Ireland uses less power for 'Earth Hour' |publisher=[[RTÉ News And Current Affairs|RTÉ News]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the three-hour period between 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm and 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm, there was a reduction of 50 megawatts, saving 150 megawatt-hours, or approximately 60 tonnes of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name = "continuation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mhojojmhcwoj/ |title= Call for continuation of Earth Hour ethos |publisher=Breakingnews.ie |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Người Hà Nội giờ tắt đèn-28032009937.jpg|thumb|left|Vietnamese lady at earth hour 2009]]
In [[Dubai]], where external lighting on several major city landmarks was turned off and street lighting in selected areas was dimmed by 50%, the Electricity and Water Authority reported savings of 100 megawatt-hours of electricity. This represented a 2.4% reduction in demand compared to before the hour began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/515051-dubai-slashes-energy-use-for-earth-hour?ln=en |title= Dubai slashes energy use for Earth Hour |publisher=[[Arabian Business]] |date= March 2008 |accessdate = 2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth Hour Sky Tower Auckland.jpg|thumb|The [[Sky Tower (Auckland)|Sky Tower]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, switched off its usual floodlighting during the Earth Hour, and re-lit afterwards. (the red lights in the middle image are [[aircraft warning lights]]) ]]
The best result was from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, with the city reporting a drop of 13% in electricity demand. However, national grid operator [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] reported that New Zealand's power consumption during Earth Hour was 335 megawatts, higher than the 328 megawatt average of the previous two Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/4457620a11.html Lights on, power use up for Earth Hour]. Kelly Andrew. ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]''. Monday, March 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]], Australia reduced demand by 10.1%. Sydney, being the city that participated in both the 2007 and 2008 Earth Hours, cut electricity consumption by 8.4%.

Despite official organizers WWF stating that the event is not about the reduction in electricity, a number of public institutions reported on electricity savings in their cities to see participation numbers. The [[Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]], excluding the city of [[Toronto]], saw a decrease of 6% in electricity usage while [[Toronto]] saw a decrease of 15.1% (nearly doubled from 8.7% the previous year) as many businesses darkened, including the landmark [[CN Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090329/earth_hour_090329/20090329?hub=TorontoHome |title=CTV Toronto – Earth Hour prompts 15 per cent T.O. power drop – CTV News |publisher=Toronto.ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States polling showed that an estimated 90,000,000 Americans participated in Earth Hour as lights were turned off around the country, including landmarks such as [[Mount Rushmore]], the [[Las Vegas Strip]], the [[Empire State Building]] and [[Niagara Falls]].

Some cities and landmarks took the opportunity to make more long-term adjustments to their everyday power consumption. In Chicago, the [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] (BOMA) developed lighting guidelines to reduce light pollution and reduce the carbon footprint of downtown buildings. [[Mount Rushmore]] in [[South Dakota]] started powering down each night around 9&amp;nbsp;pm instead of 11&amp;nbsp;pm.

In [[Vietnam]], electricity demand fell 500,000&amp;nbsp;kWh during Earth Hour 2010, which was three times larger than the first time the country joined the event in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[Tr&amp;#7903; v&amp;#7873;] |url=http://www.vnexpress.net/GL/Kinh-doanh/2010/03/3BA1A2E1/ |title=Tiết kiệm 450 triệu đồng trong giờ Trái đất |publisher=VnExpress |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
Earth Hour 2011 was the biggest year in the campaign's five-year history, reaffirming it as the largest ever voluntary action for the environment. In 2011, the tagline "Beyond the Hour" was adopted by organizers as a way to encourage people to take their commitment to the cause beyond the 60-minute event. Together with agency Leo Burnett, Earth Hour unveiled an updated planet themed logo that included a small plus symbol to the right of the signature "60" which was used in previous years. The 60+ symbol continues to be the main logo used by campaign organizers around the world.

Earth Hour 2011 took place in a record 5,251 cities and towns in 135 countries and territories on all seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |title=about |publisher=Earth Hour |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330132314/http://www.earthhour.org/page/about/about-earth-hour |archivedate=March 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an estimated reach of 1.8&amp;nbsp;billion people across the globe.

The [[Philippines]], which has been an active participant of the Earth Hour, had an early "earth hour" when power was accidentally interrupted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gatdulla and Villanueva|first=Rodina and Donabelle|title=Earth Hour comes early in Metro |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=670245&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=68&amp;newsalert|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; plunging Metro Manila and nearby [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] into darkness. After power was restored, major buildings, commercial centers and residential areas in Metro Manila and most [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] continued to turn off their lights, while participating channels in the Philippines, ABS-CBN and Cartoon Network halted their transmissions for an hour.

30 provinces and cities in Vietnam took part in Earth Hour 2011 with the main event held in [[Nha Trang]]. The nation's electricity demand fell 400,000&amp;nbsp;kWh, one-fifth less than the previous year's. Vietnam managed to save 500 million [[VND]] (US$23,809) thanks to the saved power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |title=Vietnam Foreign Press Center – Vietnam saves 400,000 kWh of power during Earth Hour |publisher=Presscenter.org.vn |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322162359/http://www.presscenter.org.vn/en/content/view/5038/51/ |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube promoted the Earth Hour by changing its logo, and by adding a switch on/off feature near the title of each video, so that users could change the background colour from white to black.

One of the least co-operative areas traditionally has been [[Alberta]]; in 2008, Calgary's power consumption went up during Earth Hour. The trend continued in 2011 when [[Edmonton]]'s power usage also increased. While [[Calgary]]'s power usage went down in 2011 during the event, electricity officials could not distinguish their readings between normal usage and a conscious attempt to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/story/2011/03/28/edmonton-earth-hour-failure.html |title=No Energy for Earth Hour |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth Hour 2014 Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/earth-hour-2014-report|title=2014 Report|work=Earth Hour|accessdate=May 31, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524150131/https://www.earthhour.org/earth-hour-2014-report|archivedate=May 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted a broad range of environmental outcomes achieved by the movement across 162 countries and territories around the world. More than US$60,000 was raised on the Earth Hour Blue platform for grassroots environmental projects run by WWF. The movement also saw campaigns to help protect Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the launch of a Blue Sky App in China, and the delivery of thousands of wood efficient stoves to communities in Madagascar.

===2015===
Earth Hour 2015 took place on Saturday, March 28, again between 8:30 and 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm local time.&lt;ref name="earthhour2"&gt;[http://www.earthhour.org/celebrating-earth-hour Celebrating Earth Hour] Earth Hour/WWF Website&lt;/ref&gt; The tagline for the global campaign was "Change Climate Change", returning to the movement's original focus to initiate citizen action on global warming. A day before the event, over 170 countries and territories had confirmed their participation; with more than 1200 landmarks and close to 40 UNESCO world heritage sites set for the switch off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/national/2015/03/25/earth-hour-to-illuminate-climate.html |title=Earth Hour to illuminate climate |work=skynews.com.au |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=May 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503055916/http://www.skynews.com.au/news/national/2015/03/25/earth-hour-to-illuminate-climate.html |archivedate=May 3, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uniquely participating in the Earth Hour activity are the inhabitants of an island called [[Sibuyan]] in the Philippines who turned on their lights to elevate the message of using renewable energy. The island's source of electricity is a mini-hydro power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/88271-philippines-sibuyan-island-lights-earth-hour|title=PH island switches on lights during Earth Hour|work=Rappler|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
Earth Hour 2016 was on Saturday, March 19, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm during participants' local time. It was also changed to avoid coinciding with the Christian [[Holy Saturday]], which fell on March 26 of that year. It was the 10th anniversary of the campaign's beginnings in Sydney, Australia. Östersund in Sweden cancelled the 2016 event, following a spate of sex attacks, highlighting safety as a subject for discussion when saving resources.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Almost all the countries in the world observed Earth Hour.

=== 2017 ===
Earth Hour occurred on Saturday, March 25.

=== 2018 ===
Earth Hour 2018 took place on March 24, from 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm in participants' time, in order to avoid coinciding with Catholic [[Holy Saturday]] which fell on March 31.

==Measurement of reduction in electricity use==
The Earth Hour Global FAQ page states:
{{Quote|Earth Hour does not purport to be an energy/[[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction]] exercise, it is a symbolic action. Therefore, we do not engage in the measurement of energy/carbon reduction levels for the hour itself. Earth Hour is an initiative to encourage individuals, businesses and governments around the world to take accountability for their [[ecological footprint]] and engage in dialogue and resource exchange that provides real solutions to our environmental challenges. Participation in Earth Hour symbolizes a commitment to change beyond the hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthhour.org/celebrating-earth-hour |title=Celebrating Earth Hour |publisher=Earth Hour |accessdate=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 2014 study published in ''Energy Research and Social Science'' compiled 274 measurements of observed changes in electricity demand caused by Earth Hour in 10 countries, spanning 6 years, and found that the events reduced electricity consumption an average of 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000474|title=The electricity impacts of Earth Hour: An international comparative analysis of energy-saving behavior|accessdate=May 31, 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.04.014|volume=2|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|pages=159–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted the policy challenge of converting Earth Hour's short-term energy saving into longer-term actions, including sustained changes in behaviour and investment.

==Criticism==

[[Bjørn Lomborg]], author of ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'', wrote, "It is vital to make [[solar power|solar]] and [[green energy|other new technology]] cheaper than fossil fuels quickly so we can turn off carbon energy sources for a lot longer than one hour and keep the planet running... Fossil fuels literally gave us an enlightenment, by lighting our world and giving us protection from the fury of the elements. It is ironic that today's pure symbolism should hark back to a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|darker age]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25247677-7583,00.html | title = Hour of no power increases emissions | publisher = The Australian | date = March 27, 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.lomborg.com/sites/lomborg.com/files/2009_mc_27_bl_op-ed_hour_of_no_power_0.pdf | archivedate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg also pointed out the feel-good factor Earth Hour creates, noting that it is an "ineffective feel good event" that makes people feel they are doing something for the environment, while in reality the amount of carbon emissions reduced by the earth hour is negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Why Bjorn Lomborg won't be turning off the lights during Earth Hour|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/q-a-why-bjorn-lomborg-won-t-be-turning-off-the-lights-during-earth-hour-1.2591072|accessdate=June 12, 2014|work=Mark Gollom, CBC News|agency=CBC News|issue=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms of Earth Hour have included the following:  
* Some critics point out that the reduction in power consumption during Earth Hour itself is relatively insignificant.&lt;ref name = "rage against dimming"&gt;{{cite news | last = Soloman | first = David | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21694864-7583,00.html | title = Rage, rage against dimming of the light | publisher = The Australian | date = May 9, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Herald Sun]]'' equated the power savings in the Sydney central business district to "taking 48,613 cars off the road for 1 hour".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Australian columnist [[Andrew Bolt]] pointed out that "A cut so tiny is trivial – equal to taking six cars off the road for a year".&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, Andrew (March 28, 2008).

*Other environmentalists have criticized Earth Hour's focus on individual behaviour, when a small number of fossil fuel companies have emitted the vast majority of man-made carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainababble.fish/?p=101|title=Sustainababble Podcast - Earth Hour|last=|first=|date=29 March 2015|website=|access-date=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam McGibbon, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized Earth Hour for releasing fossil fuel companies and politicians from their responsibility to deal with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/earth-hour-climate-change-environment-fossil-fuels-boycott-make-change-happen-really-care-a7643971.html|title=If you really care about climate change, boycott Earth Hour|date=2017-03-22|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' said that most candles are made from [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], a heavy [[hydrocarbon]] derived from [[crude oil]], a [[fossil fuel]], and that depending on how many candles a person burns (if one uses candles during Earth Hour), whether or not they normally use [[compact fluorescent light]] bulbs, and what source of energy is used to produce their electricity, in some cases, replacing light bulbs with candles will cause an increase, instead of a decrease, in carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2009/03/27/does-lighting-candles-for-earth-hour-defeat-the-purpose/ Does lighting candles for Earth Hour defeat the purpose?], ''Christian Science Monitor'', March 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 29, 2009, one day after Earth Hour 2009, ''Dân Trí Daily News'' published an editorial expressing concern that many young people chose to drive around the darkened city of [[Hanoi]] for fun, exhausting petroleum instead of electricity and resulting in long traffic jams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dantri.com.vn/xa-hoi/cai-nhin-khac-trong-gio-trai-dat-316112.htm "Cái nhìn khác trong Giờ Trái đất"], ''Dân Trí Daily News'', by Cường Cao, date: 2009-03-29. {{vi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*George Marshall of the Climate Outreach Information Network criticized Earth Hour for "playing into the hands of (the critics of environmentalists)," as darkness is symbolic of fear and decay.  "The overwhelming need at the moment is to inspire ordinary people with a vision of a better world, to make them feel that action on climate change is utterly desirable and positive.... the cultural resonance (of Earth Hour) couldn't be any worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/mar/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions|title=Earth Hour: Turning out the lights plays into the hands of our critics|last=Marshall|first=George|date=2009-03-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] has introduced an opposing ''Human Achievement Hour'' in celebration of human progress in various fields of industry, including technology, medicine, energy, and more. During this hour, the Institute suggests that people celebrate by using modern technology such as electricity, telecommunications and indoor plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/content/human-achievement-hour-2015|title=Human Achievement Hour 2015|work=cei.org|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2009, economist [[Ross McKitrick]] criticized the idea, saying, "Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century.[...] The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/earthhour.pdf | title=Earth Hour: A Dissent | last=McKitrick | first=Ross | authorlink=Ross McKitrick | year=2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' quoted Ross Hayman, head of media relations at the [[UK National Grid]], as saying "it could therefore result in an increase in carbon emissions" due to complications related to rapidly lowering then raising electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7527469/Earth-Hour-will-not-cut-carbon-emissions.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Earth Hour 'will not cut carbon emissions' | date=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2010, Rick Giles, president of [[ACT on Campus]], the youth wing of New Zealand's [[ACT Party]], appeared on the [[morning television]] show ''[[Sunrise (New Zealand TV program)|Sunrise]]'' to denounce Earth Hour and instead suggested the celebration of "Edison Hour". He argued that Earth Hour is an "anti-technology" cause, and that people will simply use candles instead, which is undesirable as they are petroleum-based. He argued that if we are heading for some kind of disaster, it makes sense to use technology to combat this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9MqNzQuuk |title=I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it |publisher=YouTube |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick said "I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it".
* The [[Ayn Rand Institute]] wrote, "Participants spend an enjoyable sixty minutes in the dark, safe in the knowledge that the life-saving benefits of industrial civilization are just a light switch away... Forget one measly hour with just the lights off. How about Earth Month... Try spending a month shivering in the dark without heating, electricity, refrigeration; without power plants or generators; without any of the labor-saving, time-saving, and therefore life-saving products that industrial energy makes possible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ari.aynrand.org/issues/science-and-industrialization/environmental-issues/The-Real-Meaning-of-Earth-Hour The Real Meaning of Earth Hour], by Keith Lockitch, Ayn Rand Institute, March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expressing sarcastic support for Earth Hour, the pro-carbon Carbon Sense Coalition wants Earth Hour to be renamed "Blackout Night", and to be held outside on the shortest and coldest day of the year "...to prepare our population for the dark days ahead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbon-sense.com/|title=The Carbon Sense Coalition|work=carbon-sense.com|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 2010 Earth Hour in the city of [[Uusikaupunki]] in Finland, a 17-year-old female motorcyclist hit a 71-year-old man, who was walking on the street instead of the sidewalk for an unknown reason. The man died from his injuries, while the motorcyclist and her passenger were uninjured. At the time of the accident the street lights had been turned off as part of the Earth Hour. The police stated that the lack of street lighting may have played a part in the accident, while the mayor believed the city's street lights would have been too dim to prevent it even if they had been on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mies kuoli moottoripyörän alle pimeystempauksen pimentämällä tiellä | work=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] | url = &lt;!-- http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Mies+kuoli+moottoripy%C3%B6r%C3%A4n+alle+pimeystempauksen+piment%C3%A4m%C3%A4ll%C3%A4+tiell%C3%A4/1135255005911 --&gt;http://hommaforum.org/index.php?topic=25901.5;imode | date=March 27, 2010 | accessdate=2010-03-28 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaupunki sammutti katuvalot Earth Hourin ajaksi – Mies jäi moottoripyörän alle pimeällä tiellä ja kuoli |work=[[Aamulehti]] |url=http://www.aamulehti.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/174590.shtml |date=March 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-28 |language=Finnish }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jeremy Clarkson]], ex-host of the [[BBC]] motoring programme ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', claimed switching on all electrical items in his home as a protest against the perceived impact of Earth Hour, claiming the event would have little to no effect on attitudes towards climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/jeremy_clarkson/article1976771.ece |location=London |work=The Times |title=Jeremy Clarkson |subscription=yes }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor [[Yusuf Sibai]] and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Egypt]] and [[Cyprus]] severed political ties for several years after the incident, until President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">In [[philosophy]], '''events''' are objects in [[time]] or instantiations of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] in objects.

==Kim’s property-exemplification==

[[Jaegwon Kim]] theorized that events are structured.&lt;br&gt;
They are composed of three things:
# Object(s) [x],
# a property [P] and
# time or a [[Time standard|temporal interval]] [t].
Events are defined using the [[operational definition|operation]] [x, P, t].&lt;br&gt;
A unique event is defined by two principles:&lt;br&gt;
:a) the existence condition and
:b) the identity condition.
The existence condition states “[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t”. This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states “[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t`].

Kim uses these to define events under five conditions:
# One, they are unrepeatable, unchangeable [[particular]]s that include changes and the states and conditions of that event.
# Two, they have a [[semi-temporal]] location.
# Three, only their constructive property creates distinct events.
# Four, holding a constructive property as a generic event creates a type-token relationship between events, and events are not limited to their three requirements (i.e. [x, P, t]). Critics of this theory such as [[Myles Brand]] have suggested that the theory be modified so that an event had a [[spacetime|spatiotemporal]] region; consider the event of a flash of lightning. The idea is that an event must include both the span of time of the flash of lightning and the area in which it occurred.

&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;
&lt;!-- the fifth condition is missing!--&gt;
&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;

Other problems exist within Kim’s theory, as he never specified what properties were (e.g. [[universals]], [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]], natural classes, etc.). In addition, it is not specified if properties are few or abundant. The following is Kim’s response to the above.

{{Quotation|. . . [T]he basic generic events may be best picked out relative to a scientific theory, whether the theory is a common-sense theory of the behavior of middle-sized objects or a highly sophisticated physical theory. They are among the important properties, relative to the theory, in terms of which lawful regularities can be discovered, described, and explained. The basic parameters in terms of which the laws of the theory are formulated would, on this view, give us our basic generic events, and the usual logical, mathematical, and perhaps other types of operations on them would yield complex, defined generic events. We commonly recognize such properties as motion, colors, temperatures, weights, pushing, and breaking, as generic events and states, but we must view this against the background of our common-sense explanatory and predictive scheme of the world around us. I think it highly likely that we cannot pick out generic events completely ''a priori''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaegwon Kim]] (1993) ''Supervenience and Mind'', page 37, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is also a major debate about the essentiality of a constitutive object. There are two major questions involved in this: If one event occurs, could it have occurred in the same manner if it were another person, and could it occur in the same manner if it would have occurred at a different time? Kim holds that neither are true and that different conditions (i.e. a different person or time) would lead to a separate event. However, some consider it natural to assume the opposite.

==Davidson==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[John Lemmon]] proposed a theory of events that had two major conditions, respectively: a causal criterion and a spatiotemporal criterion.

The causal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they have the same [[Causality|cause and effect]].

The spatiotemporal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they occur in the same [[space]] at the same [[time]]. Davidson however provided this scenario; if a metal ball becomes warmer during a certain minute, and during the same minute rotates through 35 degrees, must we say that these are the same event? However, one can argue that the warming of the ball and the rotation are possibly temporally separated and are therefore separate events.

==Lewis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] theorized that events are merely spatiotemporal regions and properties (i.e. [[element (mathematics)|membership of a class]]). He defines an event as “e is an event only if it is a class of spatiotemporal regions, both thisworldly (assuming it occurs in the actual world) and otherworldly.” The only problem with this definition is it only tells us what an event could be, but does not define a unique event. This theory entails [[modal realism]], which assumes [[possible worlds]] exist; worlds are defined as sets containing all objects that exist as a part of that set. However, this theory is controversial. Some philosophers have attempted to remove possible worlds, and reduce them to other [[Subjunctive possibility|entities]]. They hold that the world we exist in is the only world that actually exists, and that possible worlds are only possibilities.

Lewis’ theory is composed of four key points. Firstly, the non-duplication principle; it states that x and y are separate events if and only if there is one member of x that is not a member of y (or vice versa). Secondly, there exist regions that are subsets of possible worlds and thirdly, events are not structured by an essential time.

==Badiou==

In [[Alain Badiou#Introduction to ''Being and Event''|''Being and Event'']], [[Alain Badiou]] writes that the event (''événement'') is a multiple which basically does not make sense according to the rules of the "situation," in other words existence.  Hence, the event "is not," and therefore, in order for there to be an event, there must be an "intervention" which changes the rules of the situation in order to allow that particular event to be ("to be" meaning to be a multiple which belongs to the multiple of the situation&amp;nbsp;— these terms are drawn from or defined in reference to [[set theory]]).  In his view, there is no "one," and everything that {{not a typo|is is}} a "multiple."  "One" happens when the situation "counts," or accounts for, acknowledges, or defines something: it "counts it as one."  For the event to be counted as one by the situation, or counted in the one of the situation, an intervention needs to decide its belonging to the situation.  This is because his definition of the event violates the prohibition against self-belonging (in other words, it is a set-theoretical definition which violates set theory's rules of consistency), thus does not count as extant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Badiou]] (1988) ''L'Être et l'Événement''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deleuze==
[[Gilles Deleuze]] lectured on the concept of ''event'' on March 10, 1987. A sense of the lecture is described by James Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Stivale (editor) (2011) ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'', 2nd edition, chapter 6: Event, pp 80–90&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also wrote, "From the point of view of the difference between two possible worlds, the event is all important".&lt;ref&gt;James Williams (2003) ''Gilles Deleuze’s [[Difference and Repetition]]: A Critical Introduction and Guide'', page 78, [[Edinburgh University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "Every event is revolutionary due to an integration of signs, acts and structures through the whole event. Events are distinguished by the intensity of this revolution, rather than the types of freedom or chance."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003 p xi&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Deleuze published a magazine article "Signes et événements"&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze (1988) "Signes et événements", ''Magazine Littéraire'', #257, pages 16 to 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Nietszche and Philosophy'', he addresses the question "Which one is beautiful?" In the preface to the English translation he wrote:
:The one that ... does not refer to an individual, to a person, but rather to an event, that is, to the forces in their various relationships to a proposition or phenomenon, and the genetic relationship that determines these forces (power).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hart (1993) ''Gilles Deleuze: An apprenticeship in philosophy'', page 31, [[University of Minnesota Press]] {{ISBN|0-8166-2160-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kirkeby==
The Danish philosopher [[Ole Fogh Kirkeby]] deserves mentioning, as he has written a comprehensive trilogy about the event, or in Danish "begivenheden". In the first work of the trilogy "Eventum tantum – begivenhedens ethos"&lt;ref&gt;Ole Fogh Kirkeby (2005) ''Eventum tantum : Begivenhedens ethos.'' København: Samfundslitteratur&lt;/ref&gt; (Eventum tantum - the ethos of the event) he distinguishes between three levels of the event, inspired from [[Nicola Cusanus]]: Eventum tantum as non aliud, the alma-event and the proto-event.

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

== Background ==
30 participants, half men and half women, were expected to compete on a remote Siberian island in the [[Ob River]] for a 100 million rouble ($1.7 million) prize on a nine month survival mission.
All contestants were said to have signed death waivers and agreed not to hold the organisers accountable for criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siberian-real-life-hunger-games-will-not-stop-rape-murder-fight-1-7m-prize-1611060|title=Siberian real-life Hunger Games will 'not stop' rape or murder in fight for $1.7m prize|last=Taylor|first=Alex|date=2017-03-11|work=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. We will have nothing to do with this. This will be spelled out in a document to be signed by the participant before the start of the show.
We will not intervene into relations between participants nor monitor their sexual life either, and our cameras will not be able to follow every move in every corner of the island.|author=[[Yevgeny Pyatkovsky]], executive producer}}

However, [[Snopes]] found that 'Despite multiple misleading headlines, the waiver described by news outlets explicitly stated that contestants on the show would be obliged to "obey the laws of the Russian Federation".'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/russian-reality-show-game2-winter-allows-rape-murder/|title=Russian Reality Show ‘Game2: Winter’ Allows Rape, Murder?

A '''geohazard''' is a geological state that may lead to widespread damage or risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=March 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geohazards are geological and environmental conditions and involve long-term or short-term geological processes. Geohazards can be relatively small features, but they can also attain huge dimensions (e.g., submarine or surface [[landslide]]) and affect local and regional socio-economy to a large extent (e.g., [[tsunami]]s).

==Geohazards==
{{See also|Natural hazard}}
Human activities, such as drilling through overpressured zones—could result in significant risk, and as such mitigation and prevention are paramount, through improved understanding of geohazards, their preconditions, causes and implications. In other cases, particularly in montane regions, natural processes can cause catalytic events of a complex nature, such as an [[avalanche]] hitting a lake causes a debris flow, with consequences potentially hundreds of miles away, or creating a [[lahar]] by volcanism.

The continued and multi-disciplinary investigation into the occurrence and implications of geohazards, in particular offshore geohazards in relation with the oil and gas exploration, lead to specific mitigation studies and establishing relevant prevention mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadim | year = 2006 | title = Challenges to geo-scientists in risk assessment for sub-marine slides | url = | journal = Norwegian Journal of Geology | volume = 86 | issue = 3| pages = 351–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solheim | first1 = A.| year = | title = , 2005.

The timing of six out of eleven known provinces coincide with periods of [[global warming]] and marine [[Anoxic event|anoxia]]/dysoxia. Thus, suggesting that volcanic CO2 emissions can force an important effect on the [[climate system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825200000374|author=P.B.

The title of the book refers to the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians' [[Indian Reservation|reservation]] [[Checkerboarding (land)|checkerboard pattern]], originating from [[Land grants#United States|land grants]] to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] as an incentive to build rail lines through the region,&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|29}} when President Ulysses S.

==Historical context==
Section 14, which included the warm springs at the center of Palm Springs, and other sections surrounding Palm Springs, were "owned" by the Indians, but held "in trust" by the federal government; the Indians charged fees for bathing in the springs and picnicking in the canyon.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Chris|title=African-Americans Shaping the California Desert: Coachella Valley|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/african-americans-shaping-the-california-desert-coachella-valley.html|work=SOCAL Focus|publisher=KCET (Community Television of Southern California)|accessdate=March 19, 2012|date=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Congress passed the Allotment Act (39 Stat. 969, 976)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In fact the original General Allotment Act was the [[Dawes Act]], passed in 1887.

==Conservatorship program==

===Odlum Report===
In January 1953, [[Douglas McKay]] became [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]. Thereafter McKay asked industrialist [[Floyd B. Odlum]] (former president of Atlas Corp. and husband of [[Jacqueline Cochran]]) to investigate the affairs of the Agua Caliente Indians.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|124}} The report by Odlum's committee was completed in April 1955 and put into final form in April 1956. Among other things, Odlum's report determined: that the Band consisted of 83 persons, the majority of whom were minors; the value of the Indian land, allotted and unallotted, totaled as much as $12,000,000; and the value of the land could increase with proper development. Odlum also discussed the legal problems related to unequal allotments, taxes on non-productive real estate, the inability to lease land because of a 5-year limit, and conflicting claims of the allottees.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|127–8}} The report recommended that the Indian land be placed in a private corporation or trusteeship rather than existing wardship.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|129–30}} Odlum's recommendations were not implemented because newly elected Congressman [[Dalip Singh Saund]], who ran against Cochran in a bitter election campaign, blocked proposed legislation.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|132}} In the meantime, Congress passed Public Law No. 255 in August 1955, which allowed for leases of 50 years.&lt;ref name="GoldenCheckerboard" /&gt;{{RP|138}}

===1959 legislation===&lt;!--subject to more editing. McCabe's papers (which are referenced below) are not readily available. Ainsworth's book is poorly organized, lacking an index or TOC. The "landmark decision" is probably related to the Equalization Act.--&gt;
In 1959, a landmark decision by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] equalized allotted Indian lands, thereby setting the stage for development of Indian lands within the city of Palm Springs. This same legislation, however, recognizing the potential value of Indian lands within the boundaries of a world-famous resort, also called for the appointment of conservators and guardians to "protect" Indians and their estates from "artful and designing persons"&lt;ref name="LandProblems"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/libraries/finding_aids/records/finding_aid.php?fa=0018 USC Libraries; Archival Collections: Judge Hilton McCabe Collection on the Agua Caliente Indians] containing unpublished manuscript of ''Land Problems and Solutions of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians'' (1961), Hilton McCabe, Indio Superior Court.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laassubject.org/index.php/directory/profile/usc_dml_rare_books_and_manuscripts USC Doheny Memorial Library: Rare Books and Manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; who might otherwise cheat them out of their properties, which could now be legally sold by the individual tribal members who owned them. By declaring Indians as "incompetent" (both as children and adults) court-appointed conservators and guardians took control of a majority of Indian estates. A major oversight of the program was the appointment of judges, lawyers, and business people as Indian conservators and guardians—the very people the program sought to protect Indians and their estates from. The program was administered by the Indio Superior Court's Judge Hilton McCabe, subject of ''Golden Checkerboard''. McCabe concurrently acted as a conservator to a number of tribal members and an [[executor]], in addition to his administrative and legal roles.&lt;ref name="CoxReport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report on the Administration of Guardianships and Conservatorships Established for Members of the Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians, California|date=March 1968|publisher=Department of the Interior|location=Washington, DC|pages=56|url=|author=Palm Springs Task Force (Cox Report)|oclc=8536472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As a result of the conservatorship program the Band was able to lease land to businesses. The Spa Hotel opened in November 1962, with Eileen Miguel, head of the Band, U.S. Grant IV, great-grandson of President Grant, and McCabe at the opening ceremony. In 1961, 41 members of the Band signed a petition to McCabe thanking him for his efforts. {{Cite book

[[File:JENNY LIND HUMBUG.jpg|thumb|An 1850 cartoon of [[Jenny Lind]] outside [[P. T. Barnum]]'s New American Museum, New York City, 1850, captioned as a "Panorama of Humbug"]]
[[File:Magic vs Science.jpg|thumb|''Humbugging, or raising the Devil'', 1800. [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]]’s humbugging depicts the public as a credulous simpleton being distracted by a display of “the miraculous”, the better to have his pockets picked.]]
A '''humbug''' is a person or object that behaves in a deceptive or dishonest way, often as a [[hoax]] or in jest.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humbug|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/humbug|publisher=Collin's Dictionary|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first described in 1751 as student [[slang]], and recorded in 1840 as a "nautical phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Two Years Before the Mast | author=Dana, Richard Henry Jr. | authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. | year=1840|quote=When there is danger or necessity, or when he is well used, no one can work faster than he; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work for nothing, or, as the nautical phrase is, 'humbugged,' no sloth could make less headway.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also often used as an exclamation to mean [[nonsense]] or [[gibberish]].

When referring to a person, a humbug means a [[fraud]] or [[impostor]], implying an element of unjustified publicity and spectacle. In modern usage, the word is most associated with the character [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], created by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. His famous reference to [[Christmas]], '''"Bah! Humbug!"''', declaring Christmas to be a fraud, is commonly used in stage and television versions and also appeared frequently in the original book. The word is also prominently used in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in which the Scarecrow refers to the Wizard as a humbug, and the Wizard agrees.

Another use of the word was by [[John Collins Warren]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] professor who worked at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. Warren performed the first public operation with the use of [[ether]] anesthesia, administered by [[William Thomas Green Morton]], a dentist. To the stunned audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Warren declared, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=William |title=The Genealogy of Mass General |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/genealogy-mass-general?page=5 |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume=35 |issue=6 |year=1984 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The oldest known written uses of the word are in the book ''The Student'' (1750–1751), ii. 41, where it is called "a word very much in vogue with the people of taste and fashion", and in Ferdinando Killigrew's ''The Universal Jester'', subtitled "a choice collection of many conceits ... bon-mots and humbugs" from 1754; as mentioned in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' from 1911, which further refers to the ''New English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Humbug |volume=13 |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories as to the origin of the term, none of which has been proven:
* [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] mentions the idea that the word could be derived from the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''hum'', meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word ''bugges'' (used in the Bible), a variant of ''bogey'', meaning 'apparitions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling'' [1891], Chapter X [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gsft/gsft12.htm of ''The Haunts, Homes, and Habits of Witches in The South Slavic Lands--Bogeys and Humbugs'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse word ''hum'' mentioned, or ''hume'', actually means 'dark air' in [[Old Norwegian]]. From the other [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] based on Old Norse, there is ''húm'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] which means 'twilight', ''hómi'' in [[Faeroese language|Faeroese]] which means 'unclear', and ''humi'' in Old [[Swedish language|Swedish]] which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hum|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this word is also derived the Swedish verb ''hymla'', still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hymla|title='Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hymla|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' by [[Francis Grose]], 1731–1791, ''to hum'' in English indeed originally meant 'to deceive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dcvgr10.txt |title=Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combine this early medieval Scandinavian word with ''bugges'' from the English Bible of a later date may seem far-fetched. The word ''bug'' is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Bugge'' (of which the term ''[[Bogeyman|bogey]]'' is also derived) which is in turn a cognate of the German word ''bögge'' (of which ''böggel-mann'' (''"Goblin"'') is derived)&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Middle English Dictionary'' by Sherman M. Kuhn, Hans Kurath, Robert E.

In ''Etym. Diet.'' of 1898, [[Walter Skeat]] also proposed a similar theory, although using contemporary versions of the words, where ''hum'' meant to murmur applause, and ''bug'' being a spectre.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* It could also come from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''uomo bugiardo'', which literally means 'lying man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/dictionary/brewers/humbug.html |title=Factmonster |publisher=Factmonster |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable Italian influence on English at the time (e.g. Shakespeare's numerous Italian-based plays, approximately 150 years before the first recorded use of 'humbug').
* ''Uim-bog'' is supposed to mean 'soft copper' in [[Irish language|Irish]], worthless money, but there is no evidence of a clear connection to the term.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' also suggests that it is a form of "[[Hamburg]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; where false coins were minted and shipped to England during the Napoleonic wars, which is inaccurate as the Napoleonic wars occurred 50 years after the word first appeared in print.
* A modern conception is that it actually refers to a humming bug—''i.e.'' something small and inconsequential, such as a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], that makes a lot of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/012504.html#humbug |title=word-detective |publisher=word-detective |date=2004-01-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', there is a large beetle-like insect known as the Humbug, who is hardly ever right about anything.

The word has been used outside of anglophone countries for well over a century. For instance, in Germany it has been known since the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Horst Conrad |url=http://www.etymologie.info/~e/u_/us-ismen_.html |title=etymologie.info |publisher=Etymologie.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden since at least 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=humbug|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v.

'''Jessica McClure Morales''' (born March 26, 1986) became famous on October 14, 1987, at the age of 18&amp;nbsp;months after she fell into a [[water well|well]] in her aunt's backyard in [[Midland, Texas]]. Between that day and October 16, rescuers worked for 56 hours to free her from the {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on|spell=in}} [[casing (borehole)|well casing]] {{convert|22|ft|m}} below the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc13.com/30-years-ago-rescue-of-baby-jessica-from-the-well/1555516/|title=30 years ago: Rescue of 'Baby Jessica' from the well|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/18-month-old-girl-saved-1987-article-1.2386153|title=Jessica McClure, an 18-month-old girl, is saved after 58 long hours trapped in a well in 1987 - NY Daily News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained worldwide attention (leading to some criticism as a [[media circus]]), and later became the subject of a 1989 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television movie ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]''.

== Rescue ==
McClure's rescue proved to be a much more difficult ordeal than was first anticipated.  Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling another shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil-drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the  shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the [[jackhammer]]s used were designed for drilling downward, rather than sideways. A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. TV viewers watched as paramedics and rescuers, drilling experts and contractors worked tirelessly to save the baby's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard Jessica singing “[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]” from deep in the well. As long as she was still singing, they knew she was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Darla|title=Baby Jessica 30 Years Later: 'My Life Is a Miracle'|url=http://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-30-years-later-my-life-is-a-miracle/|accessdate=15 October 2017|website=People.com|date=31 May 2017|quote=Television viewers watched as hundreds of paramedics, rescuers, drilling experts and contractors feverishly worked to save the baby's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard Jessica singing “[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]” from deep in the well. As long as she was singing, she was still alive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five hours after McClure fell into the well, the shaft and tunnel were finally completed.

The relatively new technology of [[Water jet cutter|waterjet cutting]], used to cut through the hard rock surrounding the well, was a vital part of the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Business Week|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-0dAQAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Science Foundation (U.S.)|title=Annual report for fiscal year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EEc-gZcTJkC|year=1987|publisher=The Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Short, a muscular roofing contractor who was born without collar bones because of [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] and so could collapse his shoulders to work in cramped corners, arrived at the site and offered to go down the shaft. They considered his offer, but did not use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= J.

Midland Fire Department paramedic Robert O'Donnell was ultimately able to inch his way into the tunnel and wrestle McClure free from the confines of the well, handing her to fellow paramedic Steve Forbes, who carried her up to safety.

== Media coverage ==
[[CNN]] was on the scene with around-the-clock coverage of the rescue effort. This massive media saturation of the ordeal prompted then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] to state that "everybody in America became godmothers and godfathers of Jessica while this was going on."

From the beginning and throughout the incident, the switchboard of local media outlet [[KMID-TV]] was flooded with telephone calls from news organizations and private individuals around the world, seeking the latest information on rescue efforts. In some cases, they shared their own insight into this and similar incidents.

In 1988, McClure and her parents appeared on ''[[Live with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'' to talk about the incident.

The photograph of McClure being rescued fetched the [[1988 Pulitzer Prize|1988]] [[Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography|Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]] to Scott Shaw of the ''[[Odessa American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988 |title= 1988 Winners and Finalists |work= The Pulitzer Prizes |publisher= Columbia University |date= |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC made a television movie of the story in 1989, ''[[Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure]]'', starring [[Patty Duke]] and [[Beau Bridges]]. It featured many participants in the actual rescue and its coverage as extras.

On May 30, 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'' ranked McClure number&amp;nbsp;22 on its list of "25&amp;nbsp;lives of indelible impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koch |first=Wendy |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/top25-people.htm |title=Lives of Indelible Impact |work= [[USA Today]] |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following McClure's rescue on October 16, 1987, surgeons had to amputate a toe due to [[gangrene]] from loss of circulation while she was in the well. She also has a scar on her forehead where her head rubbed against the well casing. She had 15 surgeries over the years and has no first-hand memory of the event.&lt;ref name=Blaney&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www9.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |last= Blaney |first= Betsy |title= Baby Jessica turns 25, gains access to trust fund |work= Xfinity News |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= March 25, 2011 |accessdate= March 25, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110326215656/http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110325/US.Baby.Jessica/ |archivedate= March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents divorced a few years after the rescue.

Paramedic Robert O'Donnell, battling [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] as a result of the arduous rescue effort and struggling to cope with the abrupt decline of the fame and recognition that had been lavished on him following his heroic act, committed suicide in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belkin|first1=Lisa |title=Death on the CNN Curve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/magazine/death-on-the-cnn-curve.html |accessdate=July 18, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=July 23, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McClure graduated from [[Greenwood Independent School District|Greenwood High School]], in a small community near Midland, in May 2004. On January 28, 2006, nineteen-year-old McClure married Daniel Morales at [[Church of Christ]] in [[Notrees, Texas]], about 40 miles from Midland. They met at a day care center where she worked with his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Celizic |first= Mike |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19165433/ |title= Baby Jessica 20&amp;nbsp;Years Later |publisher= [[MSNBC]] |date= November 6, 2007 |accessdate= November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, a boy born 2007 and a girl born 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://people.com/human-interest/baby-jessica-on-the-30-year-anniversary-of-her-rescue-from-a-well-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom/|title=Baby Jessica On the 30 Year Anniversary of Her Rescue from a Well: Her Life as a Wife and Mom|first=Steve|last=Helling|date=October 16, 2017|publisher=[[People magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When McClure turned 25 on March 26, 2011, she received a [[escrow|trust fund]] of donations worth up to $800,000. Her father said she had discussed setting up a trust fund for the college education of her children.

* In the 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', a heavily fictionalized version of the Jessica McClure story plays out in TV and radio newscasts throughout the film. The entire nation is transfixed as a nine-year-old boy named "Ricky Newman" is believed to have fallen down a well in Fresno, California. Rescuers similarly dig a second well parallel to the one they think he is in, but James Cole (Bruce Willis) tells Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) that the boy is, in fact, hiding in a barn. He is later proven right. He knows this because he is a time traveler and remembers the events from when he was a child.

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup 2012==
In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by [[Let's Clean Slovenia|volunteers in Slovenia]] and [[Portugal]].

To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience – Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world. Each group or organisation was leading the cleanup action in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/countries |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

'''Maurice Gerald Flitcroft''' (23 November 1929 – 24 March 2007) was a British [[golf]]er and audacious [[hoax]]er.

Flitcroft became notorious after hitting a score of 121 in the qualifying competition for the [[1976 Open Championship]]—the highest score recorded at the [[Open Championship]]—and by a self-professed "professional golfer".&lt;ref name=Phantom&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|last2=Farnarby|first2=Simon|title=The Phantom of the Open|year=2010|publisher=Yellow Jersey Press|isbn=978-0-224-08317-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he gained significant media attention, being referred to as "the world's worst golfer". Following the 1976 Open, the rules were changed to prevent Flitcroft from attempting to enter again. Undeterred, he regularly attempted to enter the Open and several other golf competitions, either under his own name or under pseudonyms such as Gene Paceky (as in paycheque), Gerald Hoppy, and James Beau Jolley.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt; Flitcroft was married to Jean (died 2002) by whom he had two sons—one of whom caddied for him.

He is the subject of a biography, ''The Phantom of the Open'', by Scott Murray and [[Simon Farnaby]], published by [[Yellow Jersey Press]] in July 2010.&lt;ref name=Phantom /&gt;

In his obituary, [[The Daily Telegraph]] commented thus:

:Maurice Flitcroft ...was a [[Chain smoking|chain-smoking]] shipyard crane-operator from [[Barrow-in-Furness]] whose persistent attempts to [[Gate crashing|gatecrash]] the British Open golf championship produced a sense of humour failure among members of the golfing establishment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1547158/Maurice-Flitcroft.html|title=Maurice Flitcroft|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Flitcroft was born in [[Manchester]] on 23 November 1929.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== The 1976 Open Championship ==
According to his unpublished memoirs, Flitcroft took up the game after watching the [[1974 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship]].&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup |title=Crazy golfer |last=Murray |first=Scott |date=19 September 2008 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flitcroft had golfing ambitions well above his ability and came to notoriety in 1976 when, posing as a professional golfer, he managed to obtain a place to play in the qualifying round of [[The Open Championship]]—despite his previous experience amounting only to some hacking around on playing fields near his home. Flitcroft recalled, "I was looking to find fame and fortune but only achieved one of the two". He was inspired to enter the tournament by Walter Danecki, a postal worker from [[Milwaukee]] who, after being barred from becoming a professional by the [[Professional Golfers' Association of America]], entered the [[1965 Open Championship]] after telling the R&amp;A that he was a pro and set a two-round score of 221 during qualifying.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt;

When he discovered, to his shock, that any amateurs entering competitions had to have an official [[Golf handicap|handicap]]—something he lacked—he simply declared himself to be a professional. It was in the same 1976 Open that a young new player, the 19-year-old [[Seve Ballesteros]] first came to the public's attention. Flitcroft prepared for the tournament by studying a golf instruction manual by [[Peter Alliss]] which was borrowed from his local library. He further studied from instructional articles by the 1966 [[PGA Championship]] winner [[Al Geiberger]], and honed his skills on a nearby beach.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

His deception (and ineptitude) were uncovered when he managed to card a 49-[[Over par|over-par]] 121—the worst score in the tournament's history; some of the other professionals playing with him were so angry that they successfully demanded a refund of their entry fees. In addition the R&amp;A gave him a lifetime ban from all their courses.&lt;ref name=murray /&gt; It seems that none of the professionals noticed that his gear comprised only a red [[Imitation leather|imitation-leather]] bag and half a set of [[Mail order|mail-order]] clubs. As a result of his abilities, he became known as "[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|The Royal &amp; Ancient]] Rabbit".

== Other work ==
After leaving school, Flitcroft joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. Following his marriage, he and his wife settled in Barrow-in-Furness, where he worked as a crane operator at the [[Vickers-Armstrongs]] shipyard.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At other times he worked as a shoe polish salesman and an ice cream man.&lt;ref name=chortle&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/02/24/26939/the_worlds_worst_golfer,_coming_to_cinemas# |title=The world's worst golfer, coming to cinemas |last=Richardson |first=Jay |date=24 February 2017 |website=[[Chortle]]|access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2006 article in Golfonline, Flitcroft said, "I was in show business. I toured with a [[revue]], and I used to jump into a tank on the stage, I was a stuntcomedy [[high diver]]. The revue used to tour all the country and I would dive into this tank. It wasn't all glass, just the front so the spectators could see what was going on under the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0,17742,1206885,00.html |title=Cloak and hacker |publisher=GolfOnline |first=Seth |last=Kelly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210007/http://www.golfonline.com/golfonline/tours/britishopen/article/0%2C17742%2C1206885%2C00.html |archivedate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After 1976 ==

After his initiation into celebrity golf, Flitcroft briefly became a C-list celebrity and had various golf trophies (usually those celebrating poor play or egregious mishaps) named after him; he also had the distinction of having the "Maurice Gerald Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament" named after him by the 1988 Blythefield Country Club in [[Grand Rapids]]. Buddy Whitten, Blythefield's head pro stated that, "It started as a lark, but most people can't break 90 so they relate more to Maurice than they would to a touring pro." By the time of the 22nd Maurice G. Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament, which was held in May 2000, the club had featured a [[Putting green|green]] with two [[Hole (golf)|holes]] so that even the most errant of approaches were potentially rewarded. If this wasn't enough another green had a {{Convert|12|in||adj=on}} cup.

In 1988, Flitcroft himself was flown to Blythefield to play in the event. He is reported as having told the members there that it was the first time he and his wife had been out of the house together "since their gas oven exploded." Whitten further said, "It was a different sort of experience, I'd never met a crane operator from England. But his game had gotten a little better than I expected. I think he shot in the low 90s." Flitcroft said of his performance, "I wasn't playing too well. Some faults had crept into my swing. But I hit a lot of good shots.”

Flitcroft retired from [[Vickers]] in the 1970s and devoted himself to his golf—but was reduced to the ignominy of once again playing on local fields, having been banned from every local golf club after sneaking into their grounds to play without permission.

Many years after his rise to fame, Flitcroft still received [[Mail|post]] which had been addressed simply to: Maurice Flitcroft, Golfer, England.

In 2017 comedian and writer Simon Farnaby, who co-wrote a biography of Flitcroft, stated that he was writing a film script based on the book.&lt;ref name=chortle /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12202">A '''media monitoring service''', a '''press clipping service''' or a '''clipping service''' as known in earlier times, provides clients with copies of media content, which is of specific interest to them and subject to changing demand; what they provide may include documentation, content, analysis, or editorial opinion, specifically or widely. These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor.  The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded with the advent of [[telegraphy]] and [[submarine communication cable|submarine cables]] in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of [[radio]], [[television]], the [[photocopier]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Though media monitoring is generally used for capturing content or editorial opinion, it also may be used to capture advertising content.

Media monitoring services have been variously termed over time, as new players entered the market, new forms of media were created, and as new uses from available content developed.  An existing group may provide such a monitoring service, as it relates to their main purpose, while a monitoring agency generally provides such as their main business.  Alternative terms for these monitoring services as well as the information they provide include:

*Press clipping service or agency
*Media cutting service or agency
*[[Information logistics]] service
*[[Media intelligence]]
*Media information services

==History==
{{See also|Imprimatur}}
Since [[mass media]] traditionally was limited solely to print media, naturally the monitoring was also limited to these media. The world's first press clipping agency was established in [[London]] in 1852 by a Polish newsagent named Romeike. Actors, writers, musicians and artists would visit his shop to look for articles about themselves in his Continental stock. It was then that Romeike realised that he could turn this into a profitable business. 

An agency named "L'Argus de la presse" was established in Paris in 1879 by Alfred Cherie, who offered a press-clipping service to Parisian actors, enabling them to buy reviews of their work rather than purchasing the whole newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history Media Monitors Interactive history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430192851/http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[radio]] and later [[television]] broadcasting were introduced in the 20th century, press clipping agencies began to expand their services into the monitoring of these broadcast media, and this task was greatly facilitated by the development of commercial audio and video tape recording systems in the 1950s and 1960s. With the growth of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s, media monitoring service extended their services to the monitoring of online information sources using new digital search and scan technologies to provide output of interest to their clients.

Then, in 1998, the now defunct WebClipping&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webclipping.com WebClipping website]&lt;/ref&gt; website was the first firm to start monitoring Internet based news media, moving the industry toward tracking digital news quickly.

Typically, individual or organisational clients &amp;ndash; e. g. private companies and corporations, charities, government departments and ministries &amp;ndash; will subscribe to a media monitoring service to keep track of what is being said about them, their field of operations, their competitors, or other specified topics of interest.

==Industry==
The news monitoring industry provides government agencies, corporations, public relations professionals, and other organizations access to news information created by the media. Generally monitoring print, broadcast, and internet [[digital content|content]] for any mention of specific subjects of interest, a news monitoring company will analyze and provide feedback to their client in the form of press clippings, monitoring reports, and media analysis.

==Evolution==

From a cut &amp; clip service, media clipping today has expanded to incorporate technology with information.  Media monitoring clients can now opt to include print, broadcast and online to capture all their media exposure.  While this technology has allowed some of the process to be automated, many media monitoring agencies still offer the services of trained professionals to review and validate results.

Service delivery happens at three fronts. Clients may get their original hard copy clips through traditional means (mail/overnight delivery) or may opt for digital delivery.  Digital delivery allows the end user to receive via email all the relevant news of the company, competition and industry daily, with updates as they break.  The same news may also be indexed (as allowed by copyright laws) in a searchable database to be accessed by subscribers. Another option of this service is auto-analysis, wherein the data can be viewed &amp; compared in different formats.

Every organization that uses PR invariably uses news monitoring as well. In addition to tracking their own publicity, self-generated or otherwise, news monitoring clients also use the service to track competition or industry specific trends or legislation, to build a contact base of reporters, experts, leaders for future reference, to audit the effectiveness of their [[PR campaign]]s, to verify that PR, [[marketing]] and sales messages are in sync, and to measure impact on their target market. City, State, and Federal agencies use news monitoring services to stay informed in regions they otherwise would not be able to monitor themselves and to verify that the public information disseminated is accurate, accessible in multiple formats and available to the public. Some monitoring services specialize in one or more areas of press clipping, TV and radio monitoring, or [[internet tracking]]. Media analysis is also offered by most news monitoring services.

Television news monitoring companies, especially in the United States, capture and index [[closed captioning]] text and search it for client references. Some TV monitoring companies employ human monitors who review and abstract program content; other services rely on automated search programs to search and index stories.

Online media monitoring services utilize automated software called [[web spider|spiders]] or robots (bots) to automatically monitor the content of free online news sources including newspapers, magazines, trade journals, TV station and news syndication services.  Online services generally provide links but may also provide text versions of the articles.  Results may or may not be verified for accuracy by the online monitoring service.  Most newspapers do not include all of their print content online and some have web content that does not appear in print.

In the United States, there are trade associations formed to share best practices which include the North American Conference of Press Clipping Services and the International Association of Broadcast Monitors.

==Language and media – the big challenges==

In English speaking countries, the service of media monitoring, [[collation]] &amp; [[dissemination]] is fairly simple and most organizations which use [[Public Relations]] also use media monitoring. However, in multi-language &amp; multi-dialect countries the challenge of collating data locally and disseminating in a [[language translation|translated]] language of business (usually English) is a daunting task. The situation in other multi-language countries is no different.

The second large challenge for Information Logistics is the growing number of media and the media types. For example, in a country like [[media in India|India]] there are over 50,000 registered print publications, 250+ TV channels, a growing number of relevant internet sites and several hundred new blogs that need to be captured every day. Several of these need to be translated for a 'heads-up' and analysis needs to be constant and real-time.

===Illustrative examples===
An author that recently published a book and who has a strong interest in tracking how well the book is received by [[critic]]s may hire a media monitoring service. The service will have a method by which they extract any information about the author and their book from newly printed [[magazine]]s, radio programs, television programs and so on. The author will receive a printed bundle of ''clippings'', i.e., the pages of the magazines and [[newspaper]]s relating to them and their book.  They may also receive recordings of any radio reviews, television programs and so on, which refer to his book.

Most major companies and corporations subscribe to media monitoring services to keep track of any reports or comments in the media. A fast food company, for example, would receive summaries of coverage and/or copies of material drawn from a wide range of sources, including TV and radio news reports, commentaries on TV and radio shows, newspaper opinion/commentary columns, magazine articles and internet [[blog]]s.

The material collected would include any media items that relate to the company's commercial operations, its corporate [[reputation management|reputation]] or its media image. This would include reports about or discussions of the [[fast food industry]] in general, and any media item that specifically mentions the company, its clients and suppliers, its competitors or related interest groups or other specified subjects of interest, such as food/health regulations.

===Trade groups===
The [[International Association of Broadcast Monitors]] (IABM) is a worldwide [[trade association]] made up of news retrieval services which record, monitor and archive broadcast news sources including television, radio and internet.  It acts as a "clearinghouse" or "forum" for discussion on topics of collective concerns and acts as a united voice for the news monitoring industry.

===Professional organization===
[[FIBEP]] (Federation Internationale des Bureaux d’Extraits de Presse/International Federation of the Press Clipping Services) is a professional media monitoring organization. The FIBEP was established in 1953 in [[Paris]] and has close to 100 members from 44 countries. Every 18 months, the members of FIBEP members organize a three-day FIBEP-Congress. In work groups, workshops, reports and discussion circles, members discuss market trends.

==Law cases==
{{main|Associated Press v. Meltwater|Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)}}
Two parallel cases developed in 2012, [[Associated Press v. Meltwater|one in the United States]], and [[Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)|one in the United Kingdom]]. In each case, the legality of temporary copies and the online media monitoring service offered to clients, was in dispute. Essentially the two cases covered the same issue (media clippings shown to clients online) and with the same defendant, [[Meltwater Group]]. The plaintiff differed, being [[List of copyright collection societies|a UK copyright collection society]] (UK) rather than [[Associated Press]] (US), but upon parallel grounds.

The activity was ruled unlawful in the US (under the "[[fair use]]" doctrine) and lawful in the UK (under UK and EU copyright law, in summary on the basis that mere viewing is never an infringement, and temporary copies to enable a lawful purpose are themselves lawful).

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins at Howard University (2) - September 28, 2010.jpg|thumb|Tyson in conversation with [[Richard Dawkins]] at Howard University, 2010]]

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important role out there."&lt;ref name="Rationally Speaking podcast"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Interview with Massimo Pigliucci and Julia Galef |url=http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs103-neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-he-doesnt-call-himself-an-a.html |website=Rationally Speaking podcast |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has spoken about philosophy on numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of ''[[The Nerdist Podcast]]'', he stated that philosophy is "useless" and that a philosophy major "can really mess you up",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-neil-degrasse-tyson-returns-again/ |title=Nerdist Podcast: Neil deGrasse Tyson Returns Again |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Nerdist Podcast]] |last=Levine |first=Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was met with disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |title=Dear Neil deGrasse Tyson, don't be foolish about philosophy |date=June 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Chicago Now]] |last=Wall |first=James Kirk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806031740/http://www.chicagonow.com/an-agnostic-in-wheaton/2014/06/dear-neil-degrasse-tyson-dont-be-stupid-about-philosophy/ |archivedate=August 6, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson Slammed For Dismissing Philosophy As 'Useless' |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[io9]] |last=Dvorsky |first=George |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328062312/http://io9.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-slammed-for-dismissing-philosophy-a-1575178224 |archivedate=March 28, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/ |title=The one thing Neil deGrasse Tyson got wrong |date=June 7, 2015 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |last=Neumann |first=Steve |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000625/http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/the_one_thing_neil_degrasse_tyson_got_wrong/n|dead-url=no |archivedate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine |title=Why Neil deGrasse Tyson is a philistine |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |website=[[The Week]] |last=Linker |first=Damon |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416145135/http://theweek.com/articles/447197/why-neil-degrasse-tyson-philistine|dead-url=no |archivedate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] later criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Value of Philosophy |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=April 23, 2015 |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci|dead-url=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104308/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html |archivedate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al Jazeera English Doha Newsroom 1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Al Jazeera English]] Newsroom, [[Doha]], 2008 ]]

'''News''' is [[information]] about current events. This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events. It is also used as a platform to manufacture opinion for the population see [[propaganda]].

Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.

==Meaning==
===Etymology===
The [[English language|English]] word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nový|nový]]'', "new"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' – and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"News", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. "Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''rēs nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events). Compare later {{smallcaps|novel n.}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=news|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Garretson Finch]] is credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at [[Barnard College]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. John Cosgrave Is Dead Founded Finch Junior College: Was Institution's President Nearly 50 Years; Coined 'Current Events' Phrase|publisher=New York Herald Tribune|date=1 November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newness===
As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.&lt;ref name=Stephens13&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith7&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 7. "In the information which [the newspaper] chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness; to its readers, it offered regularity of publication. It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated."&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.&lt;ref name=Smith7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Théophraste Renaudot]]: "History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pettegree3&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. "Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market—and by the sixteenth century it was a real market—was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.&lt;ref name=Park675&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 675–676. "News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences."&lt;/ref&gt; News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past—or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.&lt;ref name=Park675 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, "When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff &amp; Schudson; pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man" is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. "It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodity===
According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. "... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. "The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. "[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media."&lt;/ref&gt; From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. "News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity."&lt;/ref&gt; A news agency supplies this resource "wholesale" and publishers enhance it for retail.&lt;ref name=Globalization6&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. "News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;Phil MacGregor, "International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. "Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. […] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, naïve empiricism could not last."&lt;/ref&gt; News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. "Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often—whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder—to shock."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKH&gt;Jesper Strömbäck, Michael Karlsson, &amp; Nicolas Hopmann, "Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news". ''Journalism Studies'' 13.5–6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, "if it bleeds, it leads".&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newsworthiness===
Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists apply news values to identify a news story. News values determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by its audience or readers.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-10-13 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries and at some points in history, what news media and the public have considered "newsworthy" has met different definitions, such as the notion of [[news values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues |title=News values: immediacy and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of telecommunication}}

===Folk news===
Evidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. "The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing—let alone printing presses or computers—to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. […] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange."&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town criers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. "A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth—the coffeehouse—flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Britain, reports ("tidings") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government proclamations===
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]

Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsams.nl/ |title=United Courier Systems |publisher=Ucsams.nl |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming Emperor of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''. These were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to [[Reeve (England)|sheriffs]] for public display and reading at the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specially sanctioned messengers have been recognized in [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], among the [[Khasi people]] in India, and in the [[Meskwaki|Fox]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] cultures of the American midwest. The [[Zulu Kingdom]] used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by [[griot]]s. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Town criers]] were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322–1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''—"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. "Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at [[mosque]]s, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements in marketplaces, highways, and other well-traveled places, sometimes issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early news networks===
The spread of news has always been linked to the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread. [[Mail|Postal services]] have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power in a large area.&lt;ref name=Fang14&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27. "Whoever controlled the messengers could select which anecdotes and information would be favored by this treatment. Therefore, whoever controlled the messengers gained not only a conduit to the members of a society—the ability to inform them of new regulations—but gained a measure of power over the selection of news the members of a society received—the power, for example to ensure that they received news of triumphs but not necessarily of debacles. Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the imperial communication channels, called the "[[Royal Road]]" traversed the [[Assyrian Empire]] and served as a key source of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, "Royal Roads" (1995), p. 129. "The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as ''[[cursus publicus]]'', for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visible chains of long distance signaling, known as [[optical telegraph]]y, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakker13 /&gt; The latter form of optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Asia====
[[File:KaiYuanZaBaoRemake.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of Kaiyuan Za Bao court newspaper from the Tang dynasty]]
The world's first written news may have originated in [[Spring and Autumn period|eighth century BCE China]], where reports gathered by officials were eventually compiled as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. The annals, whose compilation is attributed to [[Confucius]], were available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news themes—though they straddle the line between news and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han dynasty]] is credited with developing one of the most effective imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "The Chinese civilization was one of the earliest to have found it convenient to set up a systematic news-collection network across a large land mass. During the Han dynasty (206BC–AD219) the imperial court arranged to be supplied with information on the events of the Empire by means of a postal empire similar to the princely message systems of the European Middle Ages, when the postmasters of the Holy Roman Empire were required to write summaries of events taking place within their regions and transmit them along specified routes."&lt;/ref&gt; Government-produced news sheets, called [[tipao]], circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' ("Bulletin of the Court") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.&lt;ref name=Smith14 /&gt; The court created a Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'') to centralize news distribution for the court.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 14. "However, it was in the Tang dynasty that a specific bureau—the Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'')—was created to accommodate the local representatives. During this time, there were many rising powerful dukes, princes or governor-generals in charge of the large territories, equal in size to a modern province in China. These dukes or princes would naturally provide for their own news service at the capital Chang'an, which handled all official documents submitted by these representatives and transmitted imperial edicts in return. Recent archaeological research has uncovered such official reports from the Tang dynasty. Two archive documents of that period, originally found in Dunhuang have been regarded by Chinese scholars as the earliest forms of newspaper in the world (Fang 1997 53–8)"&lt;/ref&gt; Newsletters called ''ch'ao pao'' continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Smith14a&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "At a later stage of its development, during the Sung period (960–1278), the ''ti pao'' was made to circulate among the purely intellectual groups, and during the Ming (1367–1644) was seen by a wider circle of society."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582 there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in [[Beijing]], during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="brook xxi"&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|0520221540}} (Paperback). p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had effective communications and postal delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with the [[Taika Reform]] and again during the [[Kamakura period]] from 1183–1333. The system depended on ''hikyaku'', runners, and regularly spaced relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and Kamakura in 5–7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), pp. 45–46 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Gordenker, "Postal Symbol"; ''Japan Times'', 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of news circulation.&lt;ref name=Smith14&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The postal system established during the [[Edo period]] was even more effective, with average speeds of 125–150&amp;nbsp;km/day and express speed of 200&amp;nbsp;km/day. This system was initially used only by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own ''[[Kabunakama|nakama]]'' (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors by night.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Europe====
In Europe, during the Middle Ages, elites relied on runners to transmit news over long distances. At 33 kilometres per day, a runner would take two months to bring a message across the [[Hanseatic League]] from Bruges to Riga.&lt;ref&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets. The driving force of this new development was the commercial advantage provided by up-to-date news.&lt;ref name=Pettegree3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCusker &amp; Gravesteijn, ''Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism'' (1991), p. 21. "Business thrives on the most recent news. The merchants of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, no less than those of today, required the 'freshest advices' in order to conduct their affairs profitably."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1556, the government of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] first published the monthly ''Notizie scritte'', which cost one [[gazette|gazetta]].&lt;ref name="WAN timeline"&gt;[http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html Wan-Press.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093302/http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html |date=2012-01-11 }}, A Newspaper Timeline, [[World Association of Newspapers]]&lt;/ref&gt; These [[avviso|avvisi]] were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of [[newspapers]] though usually not considered true newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avvisi'' were sold by subscription under the auspices of military, religious, and banking authorities. Sponsorship flavored the contents of each series, which were circulated under many different names. Subscribers included clerics, diplomatic staff, and noble families. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century ''avvisi'' long passages from were finding their way into published monthlies such as the [[Mercure de France]] and, in northern Italy, ''Pallade veneta''.&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Pallade Veneta: Writings on Music and Society, 1650–1750''. Venice: Fondazione Ugo e Olga Levi, 1985. Chs. 1 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor. ''Song and Season: Science, Culture, and Theatrical Time''. Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2007. Chs. 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Postkurse 1563.jpg|thumb|Some European postal routes in 1563]]
Postal services enabled merchants and monarchs to stay abreast of important information. For the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian I]] in 1490 authorized two brothers from the Italian Tasso family, Francesco and Janettto, to create a network of courier stations linked by riders. They began with a communications line between Innsbruck and Mechelen and grew from there.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1505 this network expanded to Spain, new governed by Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]]. These riders could travel 180 kilometers in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This system became the [[Reichspost|Imperial Reichspost]], administered by Tasso descendents (subsequently known as [[Lamoral II Claudius Franz, Count of Thurn and Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]), who in 1587 received exclusive operating rights from the Emperor.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt; The [[La Poste (France)|French postal service]] and [[General Post Office|English postal service]] also began at this time, but did not become comprehensive until the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, the English system linked with Thurn-und-Taxis.&lt;ref name=Bakker13&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections underpinned an extensive system of news circulation, with handwritten items bearing dates and places of origin. Centred in Germany, the network took in news from Russia, the Balkans, Italy, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 18–19. "Since the late Middle Ages a formal network of correspondents and intelligence agents had come into being across the bulk of the European continent, busily sending news of military, diplomatic and ecclesiastical affairs along a series of prescribed routes. The information was handwritten and passed along carefully organized chains, each item being labeled with its place and date of origin."&lt;/ref&gt; The German lawyer [[Christoph von Scheurl]] and the [[Fugger]] house of Augsburg were prominent hubs in this network.&lt;ref name=Bakker11 /&gt; Letters describing historically significant events could gain wide circulation as news reports. Indeed, personal correspondence sometimes acted only as a convenient channel through which news could flow across a larger network.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 35–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A common type of business communication was a simple listing of current prices, the circulation of which quickened the flow of international trade.&lt;ref name=Bakker10&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople also wanted to know about events related to shipping, the affairs of other businesses, and political developments.&lt;ref name=Bakker10 /&gt; Even after the advent of international newspapers, business owners still valued correspondence highly as a source of reliable news that would affect their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 21. "Although the businessmen obtained information from newspapers and other public sources, for instance, from the consuls stationed in foreign towns, they placed special value on the letters received directly from their foreign partners. This is precisely the key to the existence of a network relationship: the parties were dependent on the resources controlled by both parties, both goods and information, so by mutual co-operation both parties gained mutual benefits. Long-term, personal networks were particularly well suited for transmitting information that required high reliability.&lt;/ref&gt; Handwritten newsletters, which could be produced quickly for a limited clientele, also continued into the 1600s.&lt;ref name=Bakker11&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the newspaper===

{{see also|History of newspapers and magazines}}
The [[History of paper|spread of paper]] and the [[History of printing|printing press]] from China to Europe preceded a major advance in the transmission of news.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of printing presses and the creation of new markets in the 1500s, news underwent a shift from factual and precise economic reporting, to a more emotive and freewheeling format. (Private newsletters containing important intelligence therefore remained in use by people who needed to know.)&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 6–8. "So this sort of news reporting was very different from the discreet, dispassionate services of the manuscript news men. News pamphlets were often committed and engaged, intended to persuade as well as inform. News also became, for the first time, part of the entertainment industry. What could be more entertaining than the tale of some catastrophe in a far-off place, or a grisly murder? This was not unproblematic, particularly for the traditional leaders of society who were used to news being part of a confidential service, provided by trusted agents."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of the oldest newspapers|first newspapers]] emerged in Germany in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien]], from 1605, is recognized as the world's first formalized 'newspaper';&lt;ref name="Relation"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}; World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while not a 'newspaper' in the modern sense, the Ancient Roman [[acta diurna]] served a similar purpose circa 131 BC.

The new format, which mashed together numerous unrelated and perhaps dubious reports from far-flung locations, created a radically new and jarring experience for its readers.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 9. "The news reporting of the newspapers was very different, and utterly unfamiliar to those who had not previously been subscribers to the manuscript service. Each report was no more than a couple sentences long. It offered no explanation, comment, or commentary. Unlike a news pamphlet the reader did not know where this fitted in the narrative—or even whether what was reported would turn out to be important."&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of styles emerged, from single-story tales, to compilations, overviews, and personal and impersonal types of news analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

News for public consumption was at first tightly controlled by governments. By 1530, England had created a licensing system for the press and banned "seditious opinions".&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Act]], publication was restricted to approved presses—as exemplified by The London Gazette, which prominently bore the words: "Published By Authority".&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament allowed the Licensing Act to lapse in 1695, beginning a new era marked by [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory (British political grouping)|Tory]] newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; (During this era, the [[Stamp Act 1712|Stamp Act]] limited newspaper distribution simply by making them expensive to sell and buy.) In France, censorship was even more constant.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many Europeans read newspapers originating from beyond their national borders—especially from the [[Dutch Republic]], where publishers could evade state censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new United States saw a newspaper boom beginning with the Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over the establishment of a new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 [[Postal Service Act]], and continuing into the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering free postage to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 90. "The 1792 law codified the right of newspapers to exchange copies for free with one another, and by the 1840s the average newspaper received an astonishing 4,300 exchange copies a year. Editors relied on other papers for the national news that filled most of their columns. In effect, the federal government was encouraging local papers to become outlets for a national news network that the government itself did not control."&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the [[American frontier|West]], fueled by high literacy and a newspaper-loving culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 8–9, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 31, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boosterism|Boosters]] of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1830s American, wrote [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], was "a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 48. [''"Tout est primitif et sauvage autour de lui, mais lui est pour ainsi dire le résultat de dix-huit siècles de travaux et d'expérience. Il porte le vêtement des villes, en parle la langue; sait le passé, est curieux de l'avenir, argumente sur le présent; c'est un homme très civilisé, qui, pour un temps, se soumet à vivre au milieu des bois, et qui s'enfonce dans les déserts du Nouveau Monde avec la Bible, une hache et des journaux."'']&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the ''Bureau d'Esprit''.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspapers published in the 1800s and after retained the commercial orientation characteristic of the private newsletters of the Renaissance. Economically oriented newspapers published new types of data enabled the advent of [[statistics]], especially [[economic statistics]] which could inform sophisticated investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers, too, became available for larger sections of society, not just elites, keen on investing some of their savings in the [[stock market]]s. Yet, as in the case other newspapers, the incorporation of advertising into the newspaper led to justified reservations about accepting newspaper information at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Economic newspapers also became promoters of economic ideologies, such as [[Keynesianism]] in the mid-1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers came to sub-Saharan Africa via colonization. The first English-language newspaper in the area was ''The Royal Gazette and Sierra Leone Advertiser'', established in 1801, and followed by ''The Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer'' in 1822 and the ''Liberia Herald'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; A number of nineteenth-century African newspapers were established by missionaries.&lt;ref name=Fosu60&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers by and large promoted the colonial governments and served the interests of European settlers by relaying news from Europe.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; The first newspaper published in a native African language was the ''Muigwithania'', published in Kikuyu by the Kenyan Central Association.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; ''Muigwithania'' and other newspapers published by indigenous Africans took strong opposition stances, agitating strongly for African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers were censored heavily during the colonial period—as well as after formal independence. Some liberalization and diversification took place in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers were slow to [[Arab culture|spread to the Arab world]], which had a stronger tradition of [[Communication#Verbal|oral communication]], and mistrust of the European approach to news reporting. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire's leaders in Istanbul did monitor the European press, but its contents were not disseminated for mass consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first written news in modern North Africa arose in Egypt under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who developed the local paper industry and initiated the limited circulation of news bulletins called ''jurnals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, the private press began to develop in the multi-religious country of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newswire===
The development of the [[electrical telegraph]], which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; (Days before Morse's Baltimore–Washington line transmitted the famous question, "What hath God wrought?", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.)&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"/&gt; Telegraph networks enabled a new centralization of the news, in the hands of [[wire services]] concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with [[Charles-Louis Havas]], who founded Bureau Havas (later [[Agence France-Presse]]) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical telegraph network. In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Havas's protoges, [[Bernhard Wolff]], founded [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau]] in Berlin in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Havas disciple, [[Paul Reuter]], began collecting news from Germany and France in 1849, and in 1851 immigrated to London, where he established the [[Reuters]] news agency—specializing in news from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, William Saunders and Edward Spender formed the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central Press]] agency, later called the [[Press Association]], to handle domestic news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before insulated telegraph line crossed the English Channel in 1851, Reuter won the right to transmit stock exchange prices between Paris and London.&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; He maneuvered Reuters into a dominant global position with the motto "Follow the Cable", setting up news outposts across the [[British Empire]] in Alexandria (1865), Bombay (1866), Melbourne (1874), Sydney (1874), and Cape Town (1876).&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] became a news powerhouse, gaining a lead position through an exclusive arrangement with the [[Western Union]] company.&lt;ref name=Starr177 /&gt;

The telegraph ushered in a new global communications regime, accompanied by a restructuring of the national postal systems, and closely followed by the advent of telephone lines. With the value of international news at a premium, governments, businesses, and news agencies moved aggressively to reduce transmission times. In 1865, Reuters had the scoop on the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]], reporting the news in England twelve days after the event took place.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|an undersea telegraph cable]] successfully connected Ireland to Newfoundland (and thus the Western Union network) cutting trans-Atlantic transmission time from days to hours.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headrick | first1 = Daniel R. | last2 = Griset | first2 = Pascal | year = | title = Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838–1939 | url = | journal = Business History Review | volume = 75 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Meikle, ''Interpreting News''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2009; p.

The rebels proceeded to disrupt the British telegraph network, which was rebuilt with more redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–1903, Britain and the U.S. completed the circumtelegraphy of the planet with transpacific cables from Canada to Fiji and New Zealand (British Empire), and from the US to Hawaii and the occupied Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. reassertions of the Monroe Doctrine notwithstanding, Latin America was a battleground of competing telegraphic interests until World War I, after which U.S. interests finally did consolidate their power in the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 153–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eisenbahnen- und Telegraphendichte der Erde um 1900.jpg|thumb|World railway and telegraph system, 1900]]
By the turn of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, dividing up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 26–27. "The principal feature of the world's news market in the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th, was the cartel. This was an oligopolistic and hierarchical structure of the global news market controlled by Reuters, Havas and Wolff at the top tier, in partnership with an ever-increasing number of national news agencies. Each member of the triumvirate had the right to distribute its news service, incorporating news of the cartel, to its ascribed territories: these territories were determined by periodic, formal agreements. […] The triumvirate of Reuters, Havas, and Wolff supplied world news to national news agencies in return for a service of national news […] (although the practice was rather more complicated) the national agencies had exclusive rights to the distribution of cartel news in their territories, and the cartel had exclusive rights to the national agency news services."&lt;/ref&gt; Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into "soft" news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and "human interest".&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with ''Vestnik'', the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the [[Russian Revolution]], the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency, renamed the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and eventually the [[TASS|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)]].&lt;ref name=Palmer184&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Communist Party]] created its news agency, the Red China News Agency, in 1931; its primary responsibilities were the ''Red China'' newspaper and the internal ''Reference News''. In 1937, the Party renamed the agency ''[[Xinhua]]'', New China. Xinhua became the official news agency of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=XinXin&gt;Xin Xin, "A developing market in news: Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers"; ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 28.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

These agencies touted their ability to distill events into "minute globules of news", 20–30 word summaries which conveyed the essence of new developments.&lt;ref name=Palmer184 /&gt; Unlike newspapers, and contrary to the sentiments of some of their reporters, the agencies sought to keep their reports simple and factual.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The wire services brought forth the "inverted pyramid" model of news copy, in which key facts appear at the start of the text, and more and more details included as it goes along.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"/&gt; The sparse telegraphic writing style spilled over into newspapers, which often reprinted stories from the wire with little embellishment.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 20 September 1918 ''Pravda'' editorial, Lenin instructed the Soviet press to cut back on their political rambling and produce many short anticapitalist news items in "telegraph style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), pp. 25–26. Translating Lenin: "Why instead of 200–400 lines you can't write in 20–10 lines about such simple, well-known, clear, and already mastered to a great degree, widespread phenomena like the base betrayals of the Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, like the Anglo-Japanese invasion for the restoration of the holy law of capital; like the chattering teeth of the American millionaires against Germany, and so on, and so on. It is necessary to talk about this, it is necessary to register each new fact in this regard, but in a few lines; to pound out in 'telegraph style' the new appearances of old, already known and evaluated policies."&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous eras, the news agencies provided special services to political and business clients, and these services constituted a significant portion of their operations and income. The wire services maintained close relationships with their respective national governments, which provided both press releases and payments.&lt;ref name=OBB23&gt;Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 23–24. "Earnings were generally derived from the sale of news services to media, financial or economic institutions, and governments, which were important as sources of revenue and as sources of intelligence, and it is generally considered that their news services reflected their respective national interests."&lt;/ref&gt; The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and [[economic globalization]]. "It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself. In order to send goods to another area, merchants needed to know first whether in fact to send off the goods and to what place. Information costs and speed were essential for these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
The [[British Broadcasting Company]] began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.&lt;ref name=Allen26&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 31. "It was quite normal for the average listener to be depicted as dressed immaculately in full evening dress, seated or standing elegantly with an expensive brand of cigarette in his hand, listening to his set. The BBC was happy to live up to this stereotype. Radio announces always arrived in evening dress, and announcers were chosen from the upper classes of English society. More importantly, they had to be able to speak the King's English just as the King spoke it."&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).&lt;ref name=Allen26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, RCA's Radio Group established its radio network, NBC, in 1926. The Paley family founded CBS soon after. These two networks, which supplied news broadcasts to subsidiaries and affiliates, dominated the airwaves throughout the period of radio's hegemony as a news source.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters in the United States negotiated a similar arrangement with the press in 1933, when they agreed to use only news from the Press–Radio Bureau and eschew advertising; this agreement soon collapsed and radio stations began reporting their own news (with advertising).&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Britain, American news radio avoided "controversial" topics as per norms established by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].&lt;ref name=Allen34&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, 58% of Americans surveyed by ''Fortune'' considered radio news more accurate than newspapers, and 70% chose radio as their main news source.&lt;ref name=Allen34 /&gt; Radio expanded rapidly across the continent, from 30 stations in 1920 to a thousand in the 1930s. This operation was financed mostly with advertising and public relations money.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 27. "Thus WEAF planted the seeds of a new business that eventually grew to envelop the broadcasting industry: advertising, public relations, and propaganda. From about 1927 this revolution was under way. Advertising agencies, manufacturers, sponsors, promoters, and the sellers of medical and life insurance were jockeying for places in a world of propaganda disseminated by radio broadcasting."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union began a major international broadcasting operation in 1929, with stations in German, English and French. The [[Nazi Party]] made use of the radio in its rise to power in Germany, with much of its propaganda focused on attacking the Soviet Bolsheviks. The British and Italian foreign radio services competed for influence in North Africa. All four of these broadcast services grew increasingly vitriolic as the European nations prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war provided an opportunity to expand radio and take advantage of its new potential. The BBC reported on [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. of the morning it took place, and including a clip from German radio coverage of the same event. Listeners followed along with developments throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. set up its [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] which by 1942 sent programming across South America, the Middle East, and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], a centrally located high-power station on the continent, was [[Germany Calling|seized by Germany]], and then [[Radio 1212|by the United States]]—which created fake news programs appearing as though they were created by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting American troops in the Pacific, the Japanese government broadcast the "[[The Zero Hour (World War II)|Zero Hour]]" program, which included news from the U.S. to make the soldiers homesick.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; But by the end of the war, Britain had the largest radio network in the world, broadcasting internationally in 43 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 39, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope would eventually be surpassed (by 1955) by the worldwide [[Voice of America]] programs, produced by the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 108–114, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the United States, television news watching rose dramatically in the 1950s and by the 1960s supplanted radio as the public's primary source of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., television was run by the same networks which owned radio: CBS, NBC, and an NBC spin-off called ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward R. Murrow]], who first entered the public ear as a war reporter in London, made the big leap to television to become an iconic newsman on CBS (and later the director of the United States Information Agency).&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 179, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Turner]]'s creation of the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) in 1980 inaugurated a new era of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] satellite news broadcasting. In 1991, the BBC introduced a competitor, [[BBC World Service Television]]. Rupert Murdoch's Australian [[News Corporation]] entered the picture with [[Fox News Channel]] in the US, [[Sky News]] in Britain, and [[STAR TV]] in Asia.&lt;ref name=McNair108 /&gt; Combining this new appartus with the use of [[Embedded journalism|embedded reporters]], the United States waged the 1991–1992 [[Gulf War]] with the assistance of nonstop [[Media coverage of the Gulf War|media coverage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's specialty is the [[crisis]], to which the network is prepared to shift its total attention if so chosen.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 45–48. "When a major crisis breaks out overseas, ABC, CBS, and NBC will issue news bulletins and then go back to scheduled programming and perhaps do a late-evening wrap-up, but CNN stays on the air for long stretches of time continually updating the story. The networks' version of the story will be seen in the United States; CNN's version will be seen all over the world."&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news was transmitted via [[INTELSAT]] communications satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN, said an executive, would bring a "town crier to the global village".&lt;ref name=Tomlinson /&gt;

In 1996, the Qatar-owned broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]] emerged as a powerful alternative to the Western media, capitalizing in part on anger in the Arab &amp; Muslim world regarding biased coverage of the Gulf War. Al Jazeera hired many news workers conveniently laid off by [[BBC Arabic Television]], which closed in April 1996. It used [[Arabsat]] to broadcast.&lt;ref name=McNair108&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 108–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
The early internet, known as [[ARPANET]], was controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and used mostly by academics. It became available to a wider public with the release of the [[Netscape]] browser in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, news websites were mostly archives of print publications.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[online newspaper]] was the ''Electronic Telegraph'', published by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane Richmond, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news]"; ''The Telegraph'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 earthquake in California was one of the first big stories to be reported online in real time.&lt;ref name=Allan175&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the release of web browser Netscape made news sites accessible to more people.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt; On the day of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995, people flocked to newsgroups and chatrooms to discuss the situation and share information. The ''Oklahoma City Daily'' posted news to its site within hours. Two of the only news sites capable of hosting images, the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and ''Time'' magazine, posted photographs of the scene.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt;

Quantitatively, the internet has massively expanded the sheer volume of news items available to one person. The speed of news flow to individuals has also reached a new plateau.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This insurmountable flow of news can daunt people and cause [[information overload]]. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] called this period the "technetronic era", in which "global reality increasingly absorbs the individual, involves him, and even occasionally overwhelms him."&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of government crackdowns or revolutions, the Internet has often become a major communication channel for news propagation; while it's a (relatively) simple act to shut down a newspaper, radio or television station, mobile devices such as smartphones and netbooks are much harder to detect and confiscate. The propagation of internet-capable mobile devices has also given rise to the [[citizen journalist]], who provide an additional perspective on unfolding events.

==News media today==

News can travel through different [[Media (communication)|communication media]].&lt;ref name=Globalization6 /&gt; In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a [[reporter]], where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or [[editing|edited]] and manually [[typesetting|set in type]] along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term "[[breaking news]]" has become trite as [[commercial broadcasting]] [[United States cable news]] services that are available 24 hours a day use live [[communications satellite]] technology to bring current events into [[consumer]]s' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via [[radio]], [[television]], [[mobile phone]], and the [[internet]].

Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 42–43. "In contrast, the Masai, a nomadic community of cattle raisers in Kenya, Africa, spend their lives on the move; consequently, their contact with the media is sporadic. As a result, members of the Masai community did not learn about the September 11 attack in New York until the following June."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper===
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|A newspaper is one of the most common ways to receive the latest news.]]
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Most large cities in the United States historically had morning and afternoon newspapers. With the addition of new communications media, afternoon newspapers have shut down and morning newspapers have lost circulation. Weekly newspapers have somewhat increased.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; In more and more cities, newspapers have established local market monopolies—i.e., a single newspaper is the only one in town. This process has accelerated since the 1980s, commensurate with a general trend of [[consolidation of media ownership|consolidation in media ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, too, newspapers have gained exclusive status, city-by-city, and pooled into large associations such as Chengdu Business News. These associations function like news agencies, challenging the hegemony of Xinhua as a news provider.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt;

The world's top three [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|most circulated newspapers]] all publish from Japan.

About one-third of newspaper revenue comes from sales; the majority comes from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers have struggled to maintain revenue given declining circulation and the free flow of information over the internet; some have implemented [[paywall]]s for their websites.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

In the U.S., many newspapers have shifted their operations online, publishing around the clock rather than daily in order to keep pace with the internet society. Prognosticators have suggested that print newspapers will vanish from the U.S. in 5–20 years.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Shelley Thompson, "The Future of Newspapers in a Digital Age", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers have started to track social media engagement for trending news stories to cover. Spain's [[Público (Spain)|Público]] has [https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-spains-p%C3%BAblico-redefined-its-strategy-and-grew-its-audience-40-percent reshaped their social media strategy and grew their audience by 40 %].

===Television===
Internationally distributed news channels include [[BBC News]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Sky News]]. Televisions are densely concentrated in the United States (98% of households), and the average American watches 4 hours of television programming each day. In other parts of the world, such as Kenya—especially rural areas without much electricity—televisions are rare.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42 /&gt;

The largest supplier of international video news is Reuters TV, with 409 subscribers in 83 countries, 38 bureaus, and a reported audience of 1.5 billion people each day. The other major video news service is [[Associated Press Television News]]. These two major agencies have agreements to exchange video news with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]]—itself a sizeable video news exchange.&lt;ref name=Hachten39&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN International]] is a notable broadcaster in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN /&gt;

===Internet===
[[Online journalism]] is news that is reported on the [[internet]]. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging. Many blogs have rather small audiences; some blogs are read by millions each month.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, have become an important source of breaking news information and for disseminating links to news websites. Twitter declared in 2012: "It's like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you'll always find interesting—you can discover news as it's happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time."&lt;ref&gt;Einar Thorsen, "Live Blogging and Social Media Curation: Challenges and Opportunities for Journalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone cameras have normalized citizen [[photojournalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Patrick &amp; Stuart Allan, "'The Camera as Witness: The Changing Nature of Photojournalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Schudson]], professor at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], has said that "[e]verything we thought we once knew about journalism needs to be rethought in the Digital Age."&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK3tgAEACAAJ|isbn=978-0393912876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the work of journalism can be done from anywhere and done well. It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of "news" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; "the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying".&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"/&gt;

Schudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed:
* The line between the reader and writer has blurred.
* The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred.
* The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of "pro-am" relationships has emerged.
* The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed.
* Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred.
* The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|pages=207–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. "The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schudson puts it. It is indeed complex, but it seems to be the future.

Online news has also changed the geographic reach of individual news stories, diffusing readership from city-by-city markets to a potentially global audience.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

The growth of social media networks have also created new opportunities for automated and efficient news gathering for journalists and newsrooms. Many newsrooms (broadcasters, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV) have started to perform [https://ezyinsights.com/best-practices-in-news-gathering/ news gathering on social media platforms]. Social media is creating changes in the consumer behaviour and news consumption. According to a [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/12/growth-in-mobile-news-use-driven-by-older-adults/ study by Pew Research], a large portion of Americans read news on digital and on mobile devices.

Because internet does not have the "column inches" limitation of print media, online news stories can, but don't always, come bundled with supplementary material. The medium of the [[world wide web]] also enables [[hyperlinking]], which allows readers to navigate to other pages related to the one they're reading.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Despite these changes, some studies have concluded that internet news coverage remains fairly homogenous and dominated by news agencies.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paterson2006&gt;Chris Paterson, "News Agency Dominance in International news on the Internet", ''Papers in International and Global Communication'' 01/06 (Center for International Communications Research), May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; And journalists working with online media do not identify significantly different criteria for newsworthiness than print journalists.&lt;ref name=SKH /&gt;

==News agencies==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079071-0007, Bonn, Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.jpg|thumb|Reuters office in Bonn, Germany, 1988]]
News agencies are services which compile news and disseminate it in bulk. Because they disseminate information to a wide variety of clients, who repackage the material as news for public consumption, news agencies tend to use less controversial language in their reports. Despite their importance, news agencies are not well known by the general public. They keep low profiles and their reporters usually do not get bylines.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Jane | last2 = Forde | first2 = Susan | title = "The Silent Partner: News Agencies and 21st Century News"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Communication | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[news agency]] still operating is the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W. Miller  |editor= |others= |title=Consider the source: A Critical Guide to 100 Prominent News and Information Sites on the Web |origyear= |edition= |series= |year=2007 |publisher=Information Today, Inc. |location= |language= |isbn=978-0910965774 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=1 |chapter= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and [[Advertising agency|advertising agent]], [[Charles-Louis Havas]] as [[Agence Havas]]. By the end of the twentieth century, [[Reuters]] far outpaced the other news agencies in profits, and became one of the largest companies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 2; Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Thomson Reuters employed more than 55,000 people in 100 countries, and posted an annual revenue of $12.9 billion.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;

[[United Press International]] gained prominence as a world news agency in the middle of the twentieth century, but shrank in the 1980s and was sold off at low prices. It is owned by the [[Unification Church]] company [[News World Communications]].

News agencies, especially Reuters and the newly important [[Bloomberg News]], convey both news stories for mass audiences and financial information of interest to businesses and investors.&lt;ref name=OBB21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewha&gt;John Bartram Ewha, "News Agency Wars: the battle between Reuters and Bloomberg"; ''Journalism Studies'' 4.3 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg LP, a private company founded by [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 1981, made rapid advances with computerized stock market reporting updated in real time. Its news service continued to exploit this electronic advantage by combining computer-generated analytics with text reporting. Bloomberg linked with Agence France Presse in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Ewha /&gt;

Following the marketization of the Chinese economy and the media boom of the 1990s, [[Xinhua]] has adopted some commercial practices including subscription fees, but it remains government-subsidized. It provides newswire, news photos, economic information, and audio and video news. Xinhua has a growing number of subscribers, totaling 16,969 in 2002, including 93% of Chinese newspapers.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt; It operates 123 foreign bureaus and produces 300 news stories each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Junhao | title = "From the World's Largest Propaganda Machine to a Multipurposed Global News Agency: Factors in and Implications of Xinhua's Transformation Since 1978"; | url = | journal = Political Communication | volume = 28 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other agencies with considerable reach include [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (Germany), [[Kyodo News]] (Japan), the ''[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]'' (Italy), the [[Middle East News Agency]] (Egypt), [[Tanjug]] (Serbia), [[EFE]] (Spain), and [[Anadolu Agency]] (Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the internet, [[news aggregators]] play a role similar to that of the news agency—and, because of the sources they select, tend to transmit news stories which originate from the main agencies. Of articles displayed by [[Yahoo! News]] in the U.S., 91.7% come from news agencies: 39.4% from AP, 30.9% AFP, and 21.3% Reuters. In India, 60.1% of Yahoo! News stories come from Reuters. [[Google News]] relies somewhat less on news agencies, and has shown high volatility, in the sense of focusing heavily on the most recent handful of salient world events.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt; In 2010, Google News redesigned its front page with automatic geotargeting, which generated a selection of local news items for every viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M.

==Global news system==
In the 20th century, global news coverage was dominated by a combination of the "Big Four" news agencies—Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Press, and United Press International—representing the [[Western bloc]], and the Communist agencies: [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] from the Soviet Union, and [[Xinhua]] from China.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of major world events, and analyses of all international news coverage in various newspapers, consistently found that a large majority of news items originated from the four biggest wire services.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = Kohei | title = The western perspective in Yahoo! News and Google News: Quantitative analysis of geographic coverage of online news | url = | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 75 | issue = 2| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television news agencies include [[Associated Press Television News]], which bought and incorporated World Television News; and Reuters Television.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg News created in the 1990s, expanded rapidly to become a player in the realm of international news.&lt;ref name=OBB21&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 21. "Bloomberg's influence is greater than the number of its terminals may suggest, as it feeds financial data and economic news through the AP network to AP members and clients in the United States, and to many national networks through national news agencies. Indeed, it boasts having the second largest 'wholesale' news distribution in the United States, after AP&gt; It has print, radio and television distribution in many countries: Bloomberg television is distributed via Astra satellite service in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press also maintains a radio network with thousands of subscribers worldwide; it is the sole provider of international news to many small stations.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;

By some accounts, dating back to the 1940s, the increasing interconnectedness of the news system has accelerated the pace of [[History of the world|world history]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 7. "Since World War II, an intricate an worldwide network of international news media has evolved, providing an expanded capability for information flows. This relationship between the capacity and the need to communicate rapidly has resulted from the interaction of two long-term historical processes: the evolution toward a single global society and the movement of civilization beyond four great benchmarks of human communication—speech, writing, printing, electronic communications (telephone and radio)—into a fifth era of long-distance instant communication based on telecommunications (mainly satellites) and computer technology. Harold Lasswell believed that the mass media revolution has accelerated the tempo and direction of world history. What would have happened later has happened sooner, and changes in timing may have modified substantive developments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World Information and Communication Order===
The global news system is dominated by agencies from Europe and the United States, and reflects their interests and priorities in its coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Euro-American control of the global news system has led to criticism; that events around the world are constantly compared to events like the [[Holocaust]] and [[World War Two]] which are considered foundational in the West.&lt;ref name=Zeiler31&gt;Barbie Zeiler, "Cannibalizing Memory in the Global Flow of News"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a significant amount of news reporting from the Third World has been characterized by some form "development journalism", a paradigm which focuses on long-term development projects, social change, and nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1987 the U.S. media reported on a riot in the Dominican Republic—the first major news item regarding that country in years—the resulting decline in tourism lasted for years and had a noticeable effect on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] predominates in global news exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the global news system of perpetuating [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Tomlinson&gt;John Tomlinson, "Cultural Globalization and Cultural Imperialism", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 105–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics further charge that the Western media conglomerates maintain a bias towards the status quo economic order, especially a pro-corporate bias.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) has promoted a [[New World Information and Communication Order]], which envisions an international news exchange system involving national news agencies in every country. UNESCO encouraged the new states formed from colonial territories in the 1960s to establish news agencies, to generate domestic news stories, exchange news items with international partners, and disseminate both types of news internally.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 8. "The UN, through UNESCO, consistently endeavored to encourage the spread and development of national news agencies, and of news-exchange arrangements between them, especially during the great wave of independence in Africa during the 1960s. Setting up a national news agency became one of the essential things, part of the 'script', of what it meant to be a 'nation'. Through a national news agency, a state could lay down information links domestically and internationally which would facilitate the generation and exchange of news."&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the 1980 [[MacBride report]], "Many Voices, One World", called for an interdependent global news system with more participation from different governments. To this end, also, UNESCO formed the [[Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter Press Service]], founded in 1964, has served as an intermediary for Third World press agencies.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter Press Service's editorial policy favors coverage of events, institutions, and issues which relate to inequality, [[economic development]], [[economic integration]], natural resources, population, health, education, and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=Giffard194&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives less coverage than other agencies to crime, disasters, and violence. Geographically, 70% of its news reporting concerns Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; IPS has the most subscribers in Latin America and southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Giffard194 /&gt; IPS receives grants from organizations such as the [[United Nations Development Program]] and other United Nations agencies, [[Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Diocese of Graz]], the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to report news on chosen topics, including the environment, sustainable development, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and UNESCO developed the use of satellite television for international broadcasting. In India, 1975–1976, these agencies implemented an experimental satellite television system, called the [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]], with assistance from the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]], and [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further transformation in global news flow===
By the 1980s, much of the Third World had succumbed to a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] resulting from unrepayably large loans accumulated since the 1960s. At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58–72, 133–136. "In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3). Private telecommunications operators were drawn to emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India, among others, because technological innovation coupled with policy reforms promised access to lucrative high-density business and urban middle-class consumers. […] The few comparative studies of telecommunications reform in the South show that the political environment—whether the state is responsive to democratic public interest—\and its relative power vis-à-vis foreign capital and G8 nations have shaped the terms of reform."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mohammadi, "Communication and the Globalizing Process in the Developing World", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries with less telecommunications infrastructure, people, especially youth, tend today to get their news predominantly from mobile phones and, less so, from the internet. Older folks listen more to the radio. The government of China is a major investor in Third World telecommunications, especially in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues relating to global information flow were revisited in light of the internet at the 2003/2005 [[World Summit on the Information Society]], a conference which emphasized the role of civil society and the private sector in [[information society]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 136–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==News values==
{{Journalism sidebar}}

[[News values]] are the professional norms of [[journalism]]. Commonly, news content should contain all the "[[Five Ws]]" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.

Journalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to "let the reader decide" the truth of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of "impartiality" on news broadcasters.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;Sue Wallace, "Impartiality in the News", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.

Mid-twentieth-century news reporting in the United States focused on political and local issues with important socio-economic impacts, such as the landing of a living person on the moon or the cold war. The focus similarly remains on political and local issues; the news [[mass media]] now comes under criticism for over-emphasis on "non-news" and "gossip" such as celebrities' personal social issues, local issues of little merit, as well as biased sensationalism of political topics such as terrorism and the economy. The dominance of celebrity and social news, the blurring of the boundary between news and reality shows and other popular culture, and the advent of citizen journalism may suggest that the nature of 'news' and news values are evolving and that traditional models of the news process are now only partially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues] News Values. URL Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsworthiness does not only depend on the topic, but also the presentation of the topic and the selection of information from that topic.

Although newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = "The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880–1930"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society | volume = 22 | issue = | year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 15, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1416548614|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Shipley Hiles &amp; Amanda Hinnart, "Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: "Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words."&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: "The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead. […] we need to consider adopting what I like to think of as a much wider 'radical impartiality'—the need to hear the widest range of views—all sides of the story."&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt;

==Social organization of news production==
===News organizations===
Viewed from a [[sociology of knowledge|sociological perspective]], news for mass consumption is produced in hierarchical organizations. Reporters, working near the bottom of the structure, are given significant autonomy in researching and preparing reports, subject to assignments and occasional intervention from higher decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Owners at the top of the news hierarchy influence the content of news indirectly but substantially. The professional norms of journalism discourage overt censorship; however, news organizations have covert but firm norms about how to cover certain topics. These policies are conveyed to journalists through socialization on the job; without any written policy, they simply learn how things are done.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 139–140, 146–152. "One method management could use to control its journalists would be to establish rules and regulations. This bureaucratic form would not be very efficient […] A more efficient method for controlling behavior in nonbureaucratic organizations, such as news organizations, is through professionalism. Professionalism "''makes the use of discretion predictable.'' It relieves bureaucratic organizations of responsibility for devising their own mechanisms of control in the discretionary areas of work (Larson, 1977: 168) (emphasis in original)."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists comply with these rules for various reasons, including job security.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 111–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are also systematically influenced by their education, including [[journalism school]].&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

News production is routinized in several ways. News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. "Rituals of objectivity", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scholarly frame for understanding news production is to examine the role of information [[Gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeepers]]: to ask why and how certain narratives make their way from news producers to news consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela J. Shoemaker, "A New Gatekeeping Model", from ''Gatekeeping'' (1991); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 57. "Simply put, gatekeeping is the process by which the billions of messages that are available in the world get cut down and transformed into hundreds of messages that reach a given person on a given day."&lt;/ref&gt; Obvious gatekeepers include journalists, news agency staff, and wire editors of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideology, personal preferences, source of news, and length of a story are among the many considerations which influence gatekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Although social media have changed the structure of news dissemination, gatekeeper effects may continue due to the role of a few central nodes in the social network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas John Erneste, "Toward a Networked Gatekeeping Theory: Journalism, News Diffusion, and Democracy in a Networked Model"; Dissertation accepted at University of Minnesota, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

New factors have emerged in internet-era newsrooms. One issue is "click-thinking", the editorial selection of news stories—and of journalists—who can generate the most website hits and thus advertising revenue. Unlike a newspaper, a news website has detailed data collection about which stories are popular and who is reading them.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Nguyen, "Online News Audiences: The challenges of web metrics", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The drive for speedy online postings, some journalists have acknowledged, has altered norms of fact-checking so that verification takes place after publication.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Redden, "[http://research.gold.ac.uk/6540/ The Mediation of Poverty: The News, New Media and Politics]"; Dissertation accepted at Goldsmiths, University of London, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists' sometimes unattributed echoing of other news sources can also increase the homogeneity of news feeds.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt; The digital age can accelerate the problem of [[circular reporting]]: propagation of the same error through increasingly reliable sources. In 2009, a number of journalists were embarrassed after all reproducing a fictional quotation, originating from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Timmer, "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research/ Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research: A sociology student placed a fake quote on Wikipedia, only to see it show up …]"; ''Ars Technica'', 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

News organizations have historically been male-dominated, though women have acted as journalists since at least the 1880s. The number of female journalists has increased over time, but organizational hierarchies remain controlled mostly by men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of British news organizations estimate that more than 80% of decision-makers are men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have found '[[Old boy network|old boys' networks]]' in control of news organizations in the United States and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, newsrooms tend to divide journalists by gender, assigning men to "hard" topics like military, crime, and economics, and women to "soft", "humanised" topics.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with institutions===
For various reasons, news media usually have a close relationship with the state, and often church as well, even when they cast themselves in critical roles.&lt;ref name=Fang14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmon90&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship seems to emerge because the press can develop symbiotic relationships with other powerful social institutions.&lt;ref name=Salmon90 /&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] wire service developed a "bilateral monopoly" with the [[Western Union]] telegraph company.&lt;ref name=Starr177&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annteresa Lubrano, ''The Telegraph: How Technology Innovation Caused Social Change''; New York: Garland, 1997; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IVWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 72]–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news agencies which rose to power in the mid-1800s all had support from their respective governments, and in turn served their political interests to some degree.&lt;ref name=OBB23 /&gt; News for consumption has operated under [[Statism|statist]] assumptions, even when it takes a stance adversarial to some aspect of a government.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5. "Free of an extended view of the history of press-government relations, it is easy to maintain a romantic image of the journalist, when unchained by repressive regulation, as a staunch adversary of government; it is easy to overlook the basic pro-authoritarian role that has been played by those who spread news: their success in occupying the minds of the governed with a belief in the importance, if not the inevitabiltiy, of a system of government."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, a large proportion of routine news production involves interactions between reporters and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, "The Sociology of News Production", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 14. "One study after another comes up with essentially the same observation, and it matters not whether the study is at the national, state, or local level—the story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, journalists tend to adopt a hierarchical view of society, according to which a few people at the top of organizational pyramids are best situated to comment on the reality which serves as the basisi of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 62–63. "To clarify, H.S. Becker (1967) employs the notion of a 'hierarchy of credibility' to specify how, in a system of ranked groups, participants will take it as given that the members of the highest group are best placed to define 'the way things really are' due to their 'knowledge of truth'. Implicit in this assumption is the view that 'those at the top' will have access to a more complete picture of the bureaucratic organization's workings than members of lower groups whose definition of reality, because of this subordinate status, can only be partial and distorted."&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, therefore, news tends to normalize and reflect the interests of the power structure dominant in its social context.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 34–37. "In sum, a considerable body of research supports the argument that inter-organizational- and institutional-level forces, realized in a journalistic culture of 'objectivity,' fostered by, and in the service of, progressive liberal capitalism, constrain what journalists report. News thus exhibits an identifiable and widely shared form and a content broadly consonant with the social structures and values of its political-economic context."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rival and may surpass governments in their influence on the content of news.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Leuven | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Joye | first2 = Stijn | title = "Civil Society Organizations at the Gates? A Gatekeeping Study of News Making Efforts by NGOs and Government Institutions"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Press/Politics | volume = 19 | issue = 2| year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State control===
{{Main|State media}}

Governments use international news transmissions to promote the national interest and conduct [[political warfare]], alternatively known as [[public diplomacy]] and, in the modern era, [[international broadcasting]]. International radio broadcasting came into wide-ranging use by world powers seeking cultural integration of their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 4–6, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government used BBC radio as a diplomatic tool, setting up Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese services in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; American propaganda broadcasters include [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], [[Crusade for Freedom|set up during the Cold War]] and still operating today.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States remains the world's top broadcaster, although by some accounts it was surpassed for a time circa 1980 [[Radio Moscow|by the Soviet Union]]. Other major international broadcasters include the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, North Korea, India, Cuba, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 129–133, 132, 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world (and especially, formerly, in the Soviet bloc), international news sources such as the [[BBC World Service]] are often welcomed as alternatives to domestic state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have also funneled programming through private news organizations, as when the British government arranged to insert news into the Reuters feed during and after World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 21, 55. "The Reuters news service would be broadcast from Rugby with an insertion written by the Foreign Office. The secret agreement provided that both Leafield and Rugby Radio would carry 720 000 words per year, at a cost of three and a half pence per word. During and after the Second World War, these two radio stations transmitted news whose content had been falsified with the intention of deceiving the enemy."&lt;/ref&gt; Past revelations have suggested that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies create news stories which they disseminate secretly into the foreign and domestic media. Investigation into the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] pursued in the 1970s found that it owned hundreds of news organizations (wire services, newspapers, magazines) outright.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet news warfare also involved the creation of front groups, like the [[International Organization of Journalists]]. The Russian [[KGB]] heavily pursued a strategy of [[disinformation]], planting false stories which made their way to news outlets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasts into Iraq before the [[Gulf War|Second Gulf War]] mimicked the style of local programming.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see&lt;/ref&gt; The US also launched Middle East Broadcasting Networks, featuring the satellite TV station [[Alhurra]] and radio station [[Radio Sawa]] to beam 24-hour programming to Iraq and environs.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see: Josh Getlin and Johanna Neuman, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/10/news/war-iraqmedia10 Vying for Eyes, Ears of Iraq]"; ''Los Angeles Times'', 10 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Al Jazeera]], a TV and internet news network owned by the government of [[Qatar]], has become one of the foremost news sources in the world, appreciated by millions as an alternative to the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; State-owned [[China Central Television]] operates 18 channels and reaches more than a billion viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's [[Press TV]] and Russia's [[Russia Today]], branded as RT, also have multiplatform presences and large audiences.

As distinct from [[advertising]], which deals with marketing distinct from news, [[public relations]] involves the techniques of influencing news in order to give a certain impression to the public. A standard public relations tactic, the "third-party technique", is the creation of seemingly independent organizations, which can deliver objective-sounding statements to news organizations without revealing their corporate connections.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations agencies can create complete content packages, such as [[Video News Release]]s, which are rebroadcast as news without commentary or detail about their origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Video news releases seem like normal news programming, but use subtle [[product placement]] and other techniques to influence viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations releases offer valuable newsworthy information to increasingly overworked journalists on deadline.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;Jamie Matthews, "Journalists and their sources: The twin challenges of diversity and verification", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; (This pre-organized news content has been called an [[information subsidy]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtin | first1 = Patricia A. | title = Reevaluating Public Relations Information Subsidies: Market-Driven Journalism and Agenda-Building Theory and Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Public Relations Research | volume = 11 | issue = 1| year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist relies on appearances of autonomy and even opposition to established interests—but the public relations agent seek to conceal their client's influence on the news,. Thus, public relations works its magic in secret.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye /&gt;&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen /&gt;

Public relations can dovetail with state objectives, as in the case of the [[Nayirah (testimony)|1990 news story]] about Iraqi soldiers taking "babies out of incubators" in Kuwaiti hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], both the federal government and the secessionist Republic of Biafra hired public relations firms, which competed to influence public opinion in the West, and between them established some of the key narratives employed in news reports about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rothmyer, "What really happened in Biafra? Why did themes such as mass starvation and genocide alternately surface and fade? A study of media susceptibility to public relations manipulation." ''Columbia Journalism Review'' 9.3, Fall 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the position of the public relations industry has grown stronger, while the position of news producers has grown weaker. Public relations agents mediate the production of news about all sectors of society.&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen&gt;Kevin Moloney, Daniel Jackson, &amp; David McQueen, "News journalism and public relations: a dangerous relationship", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==News consumption==
Over the centuries, commentators on newspapers and society have repeatedly observed widespread human interest in news.&lt;ref name=Stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 1–2, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite members of a society's political and economic institutions might rely on news as one limited source of information, for the masses, news represents a relatively exclusive window onto the operations by which a society is managed.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), pp. 93–94. "Because political events and issues in modern societies typically take place in specialized locations, most citizens experience politics vicariously. […] For elites, information from the media becomes just one of many sources of data. Because of their political involvement and interest and their vast base of prior knowledge, elites treat media coverage as foreground, or sources of new and/or specific information. […] Nonelites, on the other hand, are not so interested in politics, and they have relatively little prior knowledge about political issues. For nonelites, media coverage is not only a source of new data, but their only source of information."&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular people in societies with news media often spend a lot of time reading or watching news reports.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers became significant aspects of national and literary culture—as exemplified by James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which derives from the newspapers of June 16 (and thereabouts), 1904, and represents the newspaper office itself as a vital part of life in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brandon Kershner, ''The Culture of Joyce's Ulysses''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010; see Chapter Five, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yc7HAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79 Newspapers and Periodicals: Endless Dialogue]". Also see: James Broderick, "'Give Us This Day Our Daily Press': Journalism in the Life and Art of James Joyce", Dissertation accepted at City University of New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1945 study by sociologist [[Bernard Berelson]] found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike, New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news, describing themselves as "lost", "nervous", "isolated", and "suffering" due to the withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berelson, "[http://simson.net/ref/1948/What_missing_the_newspaper_means.pdf What 'missing the newspaper' means]", in ''Communications Research 1948–1949'', ed. Lazarsfeld &amp; Stanton; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1949; quoted in Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life, with specific programming anticipated at different times of day.&lt;ref name="Allen47"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to find the news boring, too serious, or emotionally disturbing. They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

People exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories—and get their "real news" from television.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and cultural cohesion===
An important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.&lt;ref name=Starr24&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 24. "Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it."&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 17. "The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group."&lt;/ref&gt; News thus plays a role in [[nation-building]], the construction of a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, "Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 156–160. "In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent—Israel's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968—gave it much weight in setting the collective agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photojournalism|Images connected with news]] can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s photograph ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]] and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; [[Kevin Carter]]'s photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture;&lt;ref name=Zeiler31 /&gt; etc.

With the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 6–7. "But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to ''these'' events, communally experienced at ''this'' moment, through global communications networks. […] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people."&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28–31. "A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence—regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sphere===
This collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=Starr24 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.&lt;ref name="Allen47"/&gt;

This idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140–144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179–185.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News events===
As the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 685–686. "In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events—at least as listener if not as spectator—as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = "The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to "rally" behind its current leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a "crisis", and influenced a presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.&lt;ref&gt;Danie Du Plessis, "What's News in South Africa?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. "Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response."&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, "What's News in the United States?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families—such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, "What's News in Jordan?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

News coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 233–234. Also see: Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Setting the collective memory agenda: Examining mainstream media influence on individuals' perceptions of the past"; ''Memory Studies'' 7.4, October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News making===
News making is the act of making the news or doing something that is considered to be newsworthy. When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University – Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"/&gt; The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.

Models of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.

News Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.

===Psychological effects===
{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}

Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Schuster, et al., "A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terr | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Rees, "The Trauma Factor", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
The content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. "Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.&lt;/ref&gt;

News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. "When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues."&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Home Week''' or '''Old Home Day''' is a practice that originated in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]] similar to a harvest holiday or festival.  In its beginning in the 19th–20th century it involved a municipal effort to invite former residents of a village, town, or city—usually individuals who grew up in the municipality as children and moved elsewhere in adulthood—to visit the "Old Home", the parental household and home town. Some municipalities celebrate the holiday annually, while others celebrate it every few years.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the practice has spread to other parts of [[North America]] and has become a broader celebration with an emphasis on local culture and history. From the [[Wilmington, Vermont]] town web site:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Town of Wilmington | authorlink = Wilmington, Vermont | title = Old Home Week 2010 | url = http://www.wilmingtonvermont.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B7F6E5A89-A189-4E95-8300-50B76E0DC660%7D | accessdate = 2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Old Home Week is a town event held every 10 years. It is best described as a town reunion, a celebration of Wilmington's citizens, past, present and future, and a honoring of its history. Events traditionally include a parade, a town dinner, class and family reunions and tours of local points of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…Old Home Week is a decennial celebration and gathering of friends and acquaintances, all sharing the common experience of having resided and/or attended school, in Wilmington. It is also a celebration for all those who now live in and love their town.  Nobody is an outsider during Old Home Week.|40px|40px}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">An '''online newsroom''' (also known as a '''pressroom''', '''mediaroom''', '''press center''' or '''media center''') is a [[website]], [[web page]] or site section that contains distributable information about a corporation or organization. The online newsroom was initially created for corporate communicators and [[public relations]] firms to target traditional [[News media|media]] outlets, fundamentally newspapers, magazines, radio stations and television stations. Multiple public relations audience interests are now supported, including media relations, investor and analyst relations, community relations, and consumer [[social media]] relations.

Most online newsrooms provide [[press releases]] and kits, photographs, logos, audio, video, executive biographies, contact information, events, company history and awards and honors. Sometimes, they also contain industry news feeds.

Increasingly companies are aggregating their presence on various social media sites into their online newsrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 Communicate magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225210651/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 |date=2012-02-25 }} Hold the Front Page, Communicate magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some newsrooms may accommodate interactive forums for product evangelists, disgruntled consumers and organizational spokespeople to engage in ongoing online conversation about the company or organization and its products, services or philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The first known online newsroom was developed in 1995 by the [[American Institute of Physics]] for the Acoustical Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acoustics.org/press/130.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first known [[social media newsroom]] product was developed in 1998 by ''TEKgroup International'', Inc. for [[Ford Motor Company]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Since this time, other companies have either developed or partnered with technical companies to offer a standalone, branded online newsroom solutions. Additionally, some companies offer an online newsroom component as a component of a larger software package that integrates the online newsroom with a media contact database and [[media monitoring service]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4062">The '''Summit of Ohrid 2013''' was a planned meeting of [[political leader]]s of countries in [[South Eastern Europe]] as well as representatives of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]] that would be held on 1 June in the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] city of [[Ohrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitel.com.mk/vesti/makedonija?page=2 Sitel Television - Ohrid Summit {{mk icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; On the 29th of May the [[President of the Republic of Macedonia]] [[Gjorge Ivanov]] in a press in the President's residence ''Villa Vodno'' made a statement that he would cancel the international meeting because of the forgive mixing of Balkan nationalism and prejudices.
{{Quote|Macedonia has acted fully in line with the SEECP regulations. Unfortunately, old Balkan prejudices and complexes have surfaced in the run-up to the summit and I will not let Macedonia pay the price.

Before the cancellation of the Summit all of the Balkan countries political leaders were invited.

'''The Poppy Fields''' were a fictitious teenage group, invented by the [[Wales|Welsh]] rock band, [[The Alarm]]. The Poppy Fields scored a hit with the release of "[[45 RPM (song)|45 RPM]]" that would become The Alarm's first hit in over a decade. [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] revealed the truth on live radio as [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] was conducting a 2004 broadcast of their then current chart countdown. The story was highlighted by international news outlets with several headlines being published globally.

Immediately after exposing the hoax, the music video for "45 RPM" was replaced by an edited version that included The Alarm's members alongside the hyped members of The Poppy Fields.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt; Peters had enticed a young band called the Wayriders to lip-sync the song for the music video while posing as members of the nonexistent group.&lt;ref name="amusic" /&gt; The events surrounding this hoax have spawned the cinematic release of ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'', its soundtrack, The Alarm ''Vinyl Tour 2013'', and the subsequent announcement of a 2013 tour by The Alarm in support of the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="mnews" /&gt;

== Hoax ==

In an interview with [[BBC News]] Online, [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] said "[[The Alarm]], most famous for their 1983 hit '[[68 Guns]]', were not always taken seriously by DJs" because of a combination of the age of the band's members and a perception that their image was outdated. Peters said, "The Alarm as an entity have been going for 20-odd years and history can go against you &amp;ndash; we wanted to break the barrier down." He continued by saying that "[The Alarm members] wanted to stir up the water a little bit, break the mould" and have the song judged on its own merits and musical value, instead of judgement being based on the perception of the band.&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; Peters told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "We noticed that a lot of bands suffer when they attempt comebacks because people generally don't believe they can ever be as good as they once were. We wanted to make sure we are judged purely on the strength of the music, and not by our old hairstyles."&lt;ref name="BBCNewsWales" /&gt;

=== The Poppy Fields ===

With The Alarm's decision to perpetrate the hoax, Mike Peters gained the cooperation of a group of young musicians from [[Chester]] called the Wayriders&lt;ref name="bbcnews" /&gt; to lip-sync The Alarm's material and pass it off as their own. The first release by the fictitious band was promoted as a cover of The Alarm's 1983 hit, "[[68 Guns]]".&lt;ref name="encofpm" /&gt; In fact it was The Alarm all along, and instead of a cover, it was a re-released version. The demo enticed executives in music production to record an album from the band called ''In The Poppy Fields'' which saw its advance release of the single, "45 RPM" entering Britain's top 30 chart. Critical reviews of the band echoed the promoters' official introduction of the band as a tribute to bands like [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]], with even more modern acts like [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] being compared.&lt;ref name="musicomh" /&gt; The truth of the song's origin was not revealed until after the song entered the charts at number 24,&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; a credit originally earned by The Poppy Fields from unsuspecting patrons who had accepted the act as fresh and new.&lt;ref name="11-30" /&gt;

== ''Vinyl'' ==

Filming for ''[[Vinyl (2012 film)|Vinyl]]'' began in the [[Denbighshire]] resort town of [[Rhyl]] in August 2010.&lt;ref name="BBCNews2" /&gt; ''Vinyl''{{'}}s soundtrack features new songs by [[The Alarm]] specifically composed for the film including the cinematic anthem, "Free Rock And Roll", recorded by The Alarm with ''Vinyl''{{'}}s leading actor, [[Phil Daniels]],&lt;ref name="BBCNews3" /&gt; in a song with The Alarm's lead vocalist and founding member, Mike Peters. The song was released as an EP single on 28 January 2013 in tandem with a national television campaign featuring both the film's cast and members of The Alarm.&lt;ref name="alarm" /&gt;

'''''The Sound of Music Live!''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by NBC on December 5, 2013. Produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], the special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. The television special starred [[country music|country]] singer and ''[[American Idol]]'' winner [[Carrie Underwood]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], and was performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].

Spearheaded by NBC chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]], the network positioned the special as being a live [[event television|television "event"]]. In preparing for the broadcast, Meron and Zadan emphasized the logistical challenges that they would face due to the live aspects of the special, and the fact that ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was an adaptation based on the musical itself and not the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]]. Meron felt that if the telecast were successful, the concept could become "another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." By her request, Underwood's casting as Maria was personally endorsed by [[Julie Andrews]], who starred in the 1965 film.

The production was met with mixed reviews; much of its criticism was directed towards the casting of Carrie Underwood to play Maria, whom critics (including the real-life [[von Trapp family]]) believed was not experienced enough in theatre to portray such an iconic role. While her vocal performance was praised, her acting was described by critics as "amateur", "lifeless" and lacking emotion. The production was a ratings success for NBC; with a total of 18.62 million live viewers, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' brought the network its highest Thursday night viewership for an entertainment program since the [[Goodnight, Seattle|series finale]] of ''[[Frasier (TV series)|Frasier]]'' in 2004, and prompted NBC to sign Zadan and Meron on to produce more live musicals for the network in the future.

==Plot==
Maria Rainer, a [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in [[Salzburg]], is contemplating the day she has spent in the mountains ("The Sound of Music").  When she returns to the Abbey, she learns from the Mother Abbess that she is to be the new governess for the von Trappe children.  Before she leaves the Abbey, Mother Abbess asks her to teach her the song that she's always singing ("My Favorite Things"). When Maria arrives at the von Trappe house, she is greeted coldly by the Captain and introduced to the children, who enter with military precision. Maria  finds that the Captain has emotionally closed himself off since the death of his wife and decides to teach his children the basics of singing to gain their trust and acceptance.

A month, later the captain returns home with Elsa Schraeder, whom he is courting, and their friend Max Detweiler, who is looking for the perfect local singing group to perform at the annual Kaltzberg Festival. When his children arrive dressed in clothes Maria had made from her old bedroom curtains he is outraged and embarrassed. Maria then confronts him and tells him how he does not know or understand his children and that they need him but this only upsets him more and he orders her to return to Nonnberg Abbey. However, upon hearing his children sing to Schraeder, his eyes are open to the truth Maria had been speaking and he embraces his children and ask Maria to stay on as governess.

He then throws a grand party for Schraeder and when the band plays the [[Ländler]], the captain's youngest son asks Maria to teach him the dance and the captain steps in to help. As the two dance an unspoken attraction begins to arise in the two and Maria puts a stop to the dancing. However, this unspoken attraction did not go unnoticed by Brigitta who confronts Maria on this. Though Maria strongly denies it she begins to realize that Brigitta is telling the truth. Then, Schraeder calls the children out to say good night to the guests and Max is instantly smitten with the idea to have the children sing in the festival and during all the hustle and bustle Maria sneaks off unnoticed and returns to the Abbey, where she confides in the Mother Abbess that she has fallen in love with the captain but that she is ready to take the orders of [[poverty, obedience and chastity]]. The Mother Abbess denies her this and encourages her to take face her problem head-on and to find the life she was born to live.

Maria then returns to the von Trapp home and is warmly greeted by the children, who no longer feel the joys of singing due to her sudden departure. When she finds out that the captain intends to marry Schraeder she decides to see her duties through until arrangements can be made for a new governess. However, the political differences between Schraeder and the captain cause the two to realize that they have no future together and she leaves. Meanwhile, the captain confronts Maria and the two admit their feelings for each other. The two agree to marry at the Abbey and while the two are on honeymoon, [[Anschluss|Germany invades Austria]].

When they return, the captain is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy and report immediately to [[Bremerhaven]]. Maria, thinking quickly, hands the Admiral the program for the Kaltzberg Festival showing that the von Trapp Family Singers are scheduled to perform, so the captain couldn’t possibly leave right away. They are granted permission to perform. During the finale, Max announces that a guard of honor is waiting to escort the captain away as soon as the concert is over. Maria leads the family in one more song to which they escape to one by one and flee to the Abbey. The Nazi soldiers search the Abbey for the von Trapps to no avail, as the family decides to flee Austria over the mountains with Maria's help.&lt;ref name="Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/the-sound-of-music-%E2%80%93-music-from-the-nbc-television-event-2013|title=The Sound of Music – Music from the NBC Television Event 2013|work=[[Masterworks Broadway]]|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and promotion==
On June 30, 2012, NBC's chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]] announced the network's plans to broadcast a live adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-NBC-Craig-ZadanNeil-Meron-to-Present-Live-Broadcast-of-THE-SOUND-OF-MUSIC-20120629#ixzz2CoUEezC5|title=NBC &amp; Craig Zadan/Neil Meron to Present Live Broadcast of THE SOUND OF MUSIC!|author=BWW News Desk|date=June 30, 2012|work=''broadwayworld.com''|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2012, the network announced that [[country music]] and [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', winner performer Carrie Underwood would star as Maria von Trapp in the production. In a statement, Greenblatt justified Underwood's involvement, saying that "[Maria] was an iconic woman who will now be played by an iconic artist."&lt;ref name=Bricker/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC musical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrie Underwood to Star as Maria von Trapp on TV's The Sound of Music|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20652388,00.html|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2013, NBC revealed the full cast of the special, and released a promotional image depicting Underwood as Maria von Trapp, wearing blond braids and a [[dirndl]], referencing one of [[Julie Andrews]]' "most iconic moments" from the [[The Sound of Music (film)|film adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strecker|first=Erin|title=NBC to re-air 'Sound of Music Live!' on Saturday|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date=December 10, 2013|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/10/sound-of-music-live-encore/|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eby&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/carrie-underwood-stars-maria-sound-music-live-poster-article-1.1458571|title=Carrie Underwood dons dirndl for NBC's 'The Sound of Music Live!' poster|first=Margaret|last=Eby|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=September 17, 2013|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being cast, Underwood personally asked Andrews for her endorsement of the role and the production, stating that "whenever I do a cover of somebody's song or whatever, I always get permission of the artist first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/134782/Carrie-Underwood-Reveals-Julie-Andrews-Gave-Sound-Of-Music-Live-TV-Special-Her-Seal-Of-Approval|title=Carrie Underwood Reveals Julie Andrews Gave 'Sound Of Music Live!'

Produced on a budget of around $9 million, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was broadcast live from a soundstage built at Grumman Studios in [[Bethpage, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/carrie-underwood-s-sound-of-music-special-to-air-live-from-bethpage-1.6528060|title=Carrie Underwood's 'Sound of Music' special to air live from Bethpage|last1=Amodio|first1=Joseph|date=December 2, 2013|website=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC, as well as producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], emphasized that the production was not a remake of the film, but an adaptation of the musical itself; Meron iterated that "the audience will discover, within the first few minutes of watching the show, that they are not seeing a TV version of the movie. They'll know right away it's ''The Sound of Music'', but it's a different ''Sound of Music'' than they are accustomed to seeing on film." Meron felt that if successful, the broadcast could "open the door to another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." He also praised the involvement of Underwood as the star of the production, believing that she was a quick learner, and "has all of the qualities of Maria." Greenblatt was highly supportive of the project, as he was, in the words of Zadan, a "passionate devotee of theater". Zadan considered the production to be "one of the profoundly complicated, amazing experiences we’ve ever had", noting the additional challenges created by the live broadcast.&lt;ref name=variety-smlcomplex&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live’: Producers Call It a ‘Profoundly Complicated, Amazing Experience’|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/sound-of-music-live-a-profoundly-complicated-amazing-experience-1200925997/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thq-somliveproduction&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC's 'Sound of Music' Producers on Live Show Fears and Big Expectations (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbcs-sound-music-producers-live-661941|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]| last=Ng|first=Philiana|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted by NBC as a "three-hour holiday event",&lt;ref name="Bricker"/&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was aired as part of a push by NBC to air more live entertainment specials. Among its most popular programs in recent years have been those with live components (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''); NBC's Jennifer Salke believed that the increased level of [[social networking service|social network]] interaction possible in a live broadcast, along with the feeling of being part of an "event", would encourage viewers to watch the special live instead of [[Video on-demand|on-demand]] or from a recording. NBC's previous attempt at event television, ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', was met with mixed reviews and viewership, but NBC did indicate that [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s advertising throughout the series brought a higher level of [[Brand awareness|awareness]] to the brand.&lt;ref name=adage-nbclive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Plots Aggressive Live Programming Strategy|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-plots-aggressive-live-programming-strategy/245473/|work=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|last=Poggi|first=Jeanine|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television special was also the first live musical special in almost fifty years on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Sound of Music: Music from the NBC Television Event|type=[[Compact disc]] [[liner notes]]|year=2013|publisher=[[Sony Masterworks|Masterworks]]|page=7|id=88843 79814 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail chain [[Walmart]] served as the presenting sponsor for ''The Sound of Music Live!''. NBC also produced five themed Walmart commercials to air throughout the special, featuring scenes of a family using products from the store set to songs from ''The Sound of Music''. The five ads were timed to air during the commercial break following the scene where the song was featured; NBC's advertising chief Dan Lovinger considered the ads to be a way to "enhance the excitement" of the presentation for families.&lt;ref name=variety-walmartads&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Ads for NBC’s "Sound of Music" Will Sound Just Like the Show|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/walmart-ads-for-nbcs-sound-of-music-will-sound-just-like-the-show-1200922060/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Prior to the broadcast, members of the real-life von Trapp family were critical of casting Underwood to play Maria, agreeing with the notion that she would be a good singer but a poor actor. They suggested that [[Anne Hathaway]], who played [[Fantine]] in the [[Les Misérables (2012 film)|2012 film adaptation]] of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], would have been a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Michael|title=Who the Von Trapps Wish Could Replace Carrie Underwood in ‘The Sound of Music Live’|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/who-the-von-trapps-wish-could-replace-carrie-underwood-in-the-sound-of-music-live/|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' received mixed reviews from entertainment critics, commending the show for its scope and supporting cast while questioning Underwood's acting capabilities.

Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote: "Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as alive as those damned hills, every time she was asked to stand on top of things and belt. But whether it was because of nerves or lack of experience, her acting was painfully lifeless and amateur throughout the first two thirds of the lengthy ordeal. The singer, it seems, is a proud graduate of the school of 'If I don't blink, they'll think I'm acting!'"&lt;ref name=db-somlreview&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live!’ Review: The Hills Are Barely Alive| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-review-the-hills-are-barely-alive.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'' liked Underwood's performance, commenting that not only could she sing, but "she is a luminous stage presence who had the guts to take on one of the most iconic roles of the stage or screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/columnists/verne-gay/sound-of-music-and-carrie-underwood-largely-a-success-1.6550556|title = 'Sound of Music' -- and Carrie Underwood -- largely a success|date = December 5, 2013|accessdate =December 6, 2013|work = [[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|last = Gay|first = Verne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the production "as lifeless as [its] alpine backdrops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV Review: '' 'The Sound of Music Live!'

He also panned Moyer, criticizing his vocal performance and describing "his attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness" as "mildly constipated" and "clenched." However, he lauded Benanti, Borle and McDonald's "strong" performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sound-music-live-tv-review-663346|title = The Sound of Music Live!: TV Review|date =December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last = Bernardin|first = Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC's Bob Greenblatt considered the production to be a success, and signed Meron and Zadan to produce another live musical for the 2014 holiday season. Greenblatt felt that there were enough recognizable, family-friendly musicals to make events like ''The Sound of Music Live!'' an annual tradition, and he indicated that NBC received e-mails and phone calls from various theatrical rightsholders, expressing interest in having their musicals adapted in a similar fashion, In January 2014, NBC announced that it would broadcast a live version of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' in December 2014, and at NBC's [[upfronts]] in May 2014, Greenblatt announced that NBC had also obtained rights to produce an adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'', although the network did not announce any timeframe for the production.&lt;ref name=nyt-morelive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html?ref=television&amp;_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-nbcmusicman&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Announces 'Music Man' Live TV Production|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6084818/nbc-announces-music-man-live-tv-production|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=January 19, 2014 |title=NBC Announces ''Peter Pan'' for Next Live Production |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/19/nbc-announces-peter-pan-for-next-live-production/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that ''The Music Man'' project was put on hold for a live performance of ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/30/wiz-nbc The Wiz is NBC's next live musical] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved October 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the concept also spread to competing networks: in April 2014, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced that it would produce a [[Grease: Live|live production]] of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', which aired in January 2016.&lt;ref name=billboard-foxgrease&gt;{{cite web|title='Grease' Live Coming to Fox TV|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070137/grease-live-coming-to-fox-tv|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC aired ''[[Hairspray Live!]]'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.
