'''Administratium''' is a well-known [[in-joke]] in [[science|scientific]] circles and is a [[parody]] both on the [[bureaucracy]] of [[academia|scientific establishments]] and on descriptions of newly discovered [[chemical element]]s. 

In 1991, Thomas Kyle (the supposed discoverer of this element) was awarded an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]], making him one of only three fictional people to have won the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V111/N40/ignobe.40n.html |title=Ig Nobel Prizes Debut |publisher=The Tech |first=Alice |last=Gilchrist |issue=40 |volume=111 |date=October 4, 1991 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spoof article was written by [[William DeBuvitz]] in 1988 and first appeared in print in the January 1989 issue of ''The Physics Teacher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315075433/http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/administ.htm |title=Administratium. New chemical Element Discovered |first=William |last=DeBuvitz |publisher= The Physics Teacher |date=January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread rapidly among university campuses and research centers; many versions surfaced, often customized to the contributor's situation.

A similar joke concerns '''Administrontium''' which was referenced in print in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebeltz.net/resume/jir.html |title=Physics Non-Department First to Photograph New Element. |first=Ellin |last=Beltz |publisher=NEIU Independent |date=June 21, 1993 |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation on the same joke is '''Bureaucratium'''. A commonly heard description describes it as "having a negative [[half-life]]". In other words, the more time passes, the more massive "Bureaucratium" becomes; it only grows larger and more sluggish. This refers to the bureaucratic system, which is generally perceived as a system in which bureaucratic procedures accumulate, and whatever needs to get done takes increasingly longer to get done as soon as it touches the bureaucracy.

'''Anorexia mirabilis''', also known as '''holy anorexia''' or '''inedia prodigiosa''', is an [[eating disorder]], similar to that of [[anorexia nervosa]], that was common in the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, largely affecting Catholic nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everything2.com/node/1027402 |title=''Anorexia Mirabilis'' (idea) |date=April 2001 |publisher=The Everything Development Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espi Forcen|first=Fernando|date=2013-04|title=Anorexia Mirabilis: The Practice of Fasting by Saint Catherine of Siena in the Late Middle Ages|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=170|issue=4|pages=370–371|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12111457|pmid=23545792|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers claim they're motivated to restrict their food intake in order to achieve a holier state and would often engage in rituals designed to cause themselves pain and suffering.

== Overview ==

=== Description ===
Anorexia mirabilis is primarily characterized by the refusal to eat, resulting in [[starvation]], [[malnutrition]], and oftentimes, [[death]], but differs from [[anorexia nervosa]] in that the disease is associated with religion as opposed to personal aesthetics. Though anorexia mirabilis is, by definition, connected to religion, particularly [[Catholicism]], sufferers have been known to defy the orders of their religious superior to cease [[fasting]] and their refusal to eat sometimes preceded their involvement in religious activities. Additionally, sufferers engaged in worrisome and bizarre behaviors designed to cause them pain, so that they might be reminded of Jesus Christ's suffering, and desired to appear unattractive in hopes of avoiding marriage and sexual contact.

=== History ===
The earliest reported sufferer of anorexia mirabilis is [[Wilgefortis|St. Wilgefortis]], a legendary princess who reportedly lived sometime between the 8th century and 10th century in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], who starved herself and took a vow of chastity to avoid an arranged marriage. She asked for God to make her ugly and she subsequently grew excessive facial and body hair, which is a common symptom of malnutrition in women. Her suitor rejected her based on her appearance and so, as punishment for sabotaging the union, her father, the king of Portugal, had her [[crucified]]. For her suffering, she was venerated in the Catholic Church.

Though the disease was most prominent during the Middle Ages, modern cases do exist. Notably, in 2014, medical researchers published an article about the case of an unidentified woman in her sixties, born in Chicago, Illinois, who'd suffered from anorexia mirabilis. The woman entered a convent at the age of 13 and began to restrict her eating in hopes of achieving sainthood.

=== Notable cases ===

*[[Marie of Oignies|'''Marie of Oignies''']] (1177–1213) went to great lengths to cause herself physical pain, wanting to suffer as [[Jesus Christ]] had. She deprived herself of sleep and, when she did eat, which was very little, she favored [[bread]] so stale that it would cause her [[gums]] to bleed. She additionally made the choices to live in poverty despite being from a wealthy family and abstain from sex despite being married. Like other sufferers of anorexia mirabilis, she eventually refused to eat any food other than [[Communion wafer|communion wafers]] and died in her thirties, at the age of 36.&lt;ref&gt;Spearing, Elizabeth. Medieval writings on female spirituality. New York: Penguin Books, 2002. pg 105&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wilgefortis|'''Wilgefortis of Portugal''']] was a legendary Portuguese [[Infante|infanta]] who took a vow of virginity and began to starve herself to avoid marriage. She reportedly prayed to be made ugly, which resulted in her growing hair all over her body, which people likely assumed to be a work of God but is actually a common symptom in those with anorexia nervosa. She was ultimately crucified and later venerated as a saint within the Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Amelia A.|last2=Nguyen|first2=Mathew|date=2014|title=A Case Study of Anorexia Nervosa Driven by Religious Sacrifice|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4106065/|journal=Case Reports in Psychiatry|volume=2014|pages=1–4|doi=10.1155/2014/512764|issn=2090-682X|pmc=4106065|pmid=25105049}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Catherine of Siena|'''Catherine of Siena''']] (1347–1380) was known to [[Fasting|fast]] for long periods of time and, towards the end of her life, when her disease was at its worst, the only food she consumed was a single [[communion wafer]] given to her as part of the daily [[Eucharist]]. She defied orders from her religious superiors to eat, claiming she was too ill to do so, and in the month before she died, at the age of 33, she lost the use of her legs and her ability to swallow. In addition to restricting her food intake, Catherine was known to use insert sticks into her [[throat]] in order to activate her [[gag reflex]] and induce [[vomiting]], as someone with [[bulimia nervosa]] would do, and was known to drink the [[pus]] from the [[Ulcer|ulcers]] of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/millennium/m2/egan.html|title=Power Suffering|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Columba of Rieti|'''Columba of Rieti''']] (1467–1501) bears a number of similarities to that of Catherine of Siena, including the cutting of her hair to avoid an [[arranged marriage]] and the refusal to eat prior to her involvement in religious work. Also like Catherine, towards the end of her life, Columba restricted her food consumption to only what was given to her as part of the daily [[Eucharist]] and died in her early thirties, at the age of 34. Additionally, she wore a [[hairshirt]] and slept on thorns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://catholicsaints.info/miniature-lives-of-the-saints-blessed-columba-of-rieti/|title=Miniature Lives of the Saints – Blessed Columba of Rieti|date=2015-02-24|work=CatholicSaints.Info|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Jane''' (born c. 1948) was a woman from [[Chicago]] who began to restrict her eating at the age of 13 in hopes of being a nun and later, a saint. Her weight worried those at the convent and she was dismissed from her religious training due to concerns over her health. Her malnutrition caused [[amenorrhea]] and likely affected her development as she grew to be only 4' 10" tall but did not suffer from any form of [[dwarfism]]. At the age of 66, she weighed only 60 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Amelia A.|last2=Nguyen|first2=Mathew|date=2014|title=A Case Study of Anorexia Nervosa Driven by Religious Sacrifice|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4106065/|journal=Case Reports in Psychiatry|volume=2014|pages=1–4|doi=10.1155/2014/512764|issn=2090-682X|pmc=4106065|pmid=25105049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparing ''anorexia mirabilis'' and "anorexia nervosa" ==
''Anorexia mirabilis'' has in many ways, both similarities to and clear distinctions from the more modern, well-known "[[anorexia nervosa]]".

In anorexia nervosa, people usually starve themselves to attain a level of thinness, as the disease is associated with body image distortion. In contrast, ''anorexia mirabilis'' was frequently coupled with other [[asceticism|ascetic]] practices, such as lifelong [[virginity]], [[flagellant]] behavior, the donning of [[hairshirt]]s, sleeping on beds of thorns, and other assorted penitential practices. It was largely a practice of [[Catholic]] women, who were often known as "miraculous maids".

The anorexia nervosa of the 20th century has historical correlates in the religiously inspired cases of ''anorexia mirabilis'' in female saints, such as [[Catherine of Siena]] (1347–1380) in whom fasting denoted female holiness or humility and underscored purity. The investigation of anorexia nervosa in the 20th century has focused on the psychological, physiological, and various other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=eclecTechs/Ashton Services |url=http://www.womenshealthsection.com/content/gynmh/gynmh010.php3 |title="Eating disorders", Women's Health and Education Center", Springfield, Massachusetts |publisher=Womenshealthsection.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Caroline Walker Bynum]] (''Holy Feast and Holy Fast''), ''anorexia mirabilis'', rather than misdiagnosed anorexia, was a legitimate form of self-expression with motives set in contrast to the modern disease paradigm.  She considers cases such as that of [[Julian of Norwich]] and other Christian anchorites, as using fasting as a legitimate means for communing with Christ.&lt;ref name=grey&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbjournal.org/grey |title=Grey, Stephanie Houston. "A Perfect Loathing: The Feminist Expulsion of the Eating Disorder", KB Journal, Volume 7, Issue 2, Spring 2011, Clemson University |publisher=Kbjournal.org |date=2003-09-21 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joan Jacobs Brumberg]] (''Fasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa'') suggests that ''anorexia mirabilis'' no longer exists not because the motives of those who starve themselves have changed, but because the paradigms for coding these behaviors have shifted. If a young woman were to make the decision to self-starve as a means to communicate with Christ, healthcare professionals would code her as anorexia nervosa regardless of her motives.&lt;ref name=grey/&gt;

Whether or not there is historical continuity between ''anorexia mirabilis'' and anorexia nervosa is a subject of debate with both medieval historiographers and the psychiatric community. Some have argued that there is historical continuity between the two conditions,{{sfn|Bell, 1987}} while others maintain that ''anorexia mirabilis'' should be comprehended as a distinct medieval form of female religious piety within the historical context of such societies.{{sfn|Bynum, 1988}}

== Historical instances ==
Anorexia mirabilis was frequently accompanied by behaviors most medical professionals today would find worrisome and dangerous. [[Angela of Foligno]] was known to eat the scabs of the poor and [[Catherine of Siena]] was known to drain the pus from of sick individuals into a cup to drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513022649/http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1998/italian-html/Morrison,%20Molly.htm|title=NARRATING THE NATIONAL IDENTITY: MYTH, POWER, AND DISSIDENCE|date=2008-05-13|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women notoriously refused all food except for the holy [[Eucharist]], signifying not only their devotion to God and Jesus, but also demonstrating, to them, the separation of body and spirit. That the body could exist for extended periods without nourishment gave people of the time a clear picture of how much stronger, and therefore how much more important, the spirit was. It mattered not in popular opinion that the reported periods of female [[fasting]] were impossibly long (from months to many years) and simply added to the allure of this very specifically female achievement.

[[File:AngelaFoligino.jpg|thumb|[[Angela of Foligno]]]]
Both [[Angela of Foligno]] (1248–1309) and [[Catherine of Siena]] (1347–1380) were reportedly ''anorexia mirabilis'' sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol8is1/reda.html |title=Anorexia And The Holiness Of Saint Catherine Of Siena |publisher=Albany.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both refused food, but drank the [[pus]] from the sores of the sick. Angela of Foligno is reported to have said it was as "sweet as the Eucharist", and also to have eaten the [[Wound healing|scabs]] and [[lice]] from those same patients, though precious little else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1998/italian-html/Morrison,%20Molly.htm Connecting with the God-Man]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513022649/http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1998/italian-html/Morrison%2C%20Molly.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time of Catherine of Siena, celibacy and fasting were held in high regard. Ritualistic fasting was both a means to avoid [[gluttony]] (one of the [[seven deadly sins]]), and to atone for past sins. Catherine initially fasted as a teenager to protest an [[arranged marriage]] to her late sister Bonaventura's husband. Bonaventura herself had taught this technique to Catherine, refusing to eat until her husband showed better manners. Fasting then was a means of exercising some control, taking power back for the individual and as such it is similar to one of the underlying factors in anorexia nervosa today. This, women could gain more freedom and respect remaining virgins than they would becoming wives. Catherine managed to pursue her interests in theology and papal politics, opportunities less likely available to a wife and mother. 
&lt;ref name=pittock/&gt; She purportedly lived for long intervals on practically no food save the Eucharist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03447a.htm |title=Gardner, Edmund. "St. Catherine of Siena." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 6 May 2013 |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1908-11-01 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to an untimely death at thirty-three years from starvation and emaciation.&lt;ref name=pittock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Alexandra%20Pittock%20Anorerxia%20Nervosa%20and%20Spirituality.pdf |title=Pittock, Alexandra. "How are anorexia nervosa and spirituality connected, and what implications does this have for treatment?", Royal College of Psychiatrists |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any additional food she was forced to eat she would expel through vomiting induced by pushing a twig or small branch down her throat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1027393 ''Anorexia Mirabilis''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie of Oignies]] (1167–1213) reportedly lived as a hermit, wore only white, cut off pieces of her body to expunge her desire, and both she and [[Beatrice of Nazareth]] claimed that not only did the smell of meat make them vomit, but also that the slightest whiff of food would cause their throats to close up entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saintm9r.htm |title=Blessed Mary of Oignies |publisher=saints.sqpn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064816/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintm9r.htm |archivedate=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cns-web.bu.edu/~satra/kaatvds/bynumpaper.htm |title=Gender in Medieval Christian Mysticism |publisher=Boston University |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gang of would-be rapists got as far as removing the clothing of [[Columba of Rieti]] (1467–1501), but they retreated as she had mutilated her breasts and hips so thoroughly with spiked whipping chains that they were unable or unwilling to continue. Columba did eventually starve herself to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domcentral.org/study/ashley/osanna.htm B.M.Ashley – Italian Dominican Women Mystics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320094220/http://www.domcentral.org/study/ashley/osanna.htm |date=March 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date= May 2013}}&lt;ref name="brumberg"&gt;{{cite book |last= Brumberg |first= Joan Jacobs |title= Fasting Girls: The History of Anorexia Nervosa |date=October 2001| pages = 43–61  |chapter = From Sainthood to Patienthood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Giles Tremlett has suggested that [[Catherine of Aragon]] was anorexic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-1326591/Was-Henry-Vllls-wife-anorexic-Catherine-Aragons-secret-problem.html |last=Tremlett|first= Giles |title=Was Henry VIII's first wife anorexic? |publisher=Daily Mail |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these women claimed that they possessed at least some measure of spiritual enlightenment from their asceticism. They variously claimed to feel "inebriation" with the [[Blood of Christ|sacramental wine]], "hunger" for God, and conversely, that they sat at the "delicious banquet of God".

[[Margaret of Cortona]] (1247–1297) believed she had extended communications with God himself. Columba of Rieti believed her spirit "toured the [[Holy Land|holy land]]" in visions, and virtually every one of these women was apparently possessed of some level of psychic prowess. These women's exercises in self-denial and suffering did yield them a measure of fame and notoriety. They were said to alternately be able to make a feast out of crumbs, exude oil from their fingertips, heal with their saliva, fill barrels with drink out of thin air, lactate even though virginal and malnourished, and perform other [[miracle]]s of note.&lt;ref name="brumberg" /&gt;

The practice of ''anorexia mirabilis'' faded out during the [[Renaissance]], when it began to be seen by the Church as heretical, socially dangerous, or possibly even Satanically inspired. It managed to survive in practice until nearly the 20th century, when it was overtaken by its more popularly known counterpart, ''anorexia nervosa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.easterneronline.com/media/storage/paper916/news/2004/02/25/EagleLife/Speaking.About.Eating.Disorders-2367510.shtml Speaking about eating disorders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207032015/http://media.www.easterneronline.com/media/storage/paper916/news/2004/02/25/EagleLife/Speaking.About.Eating.Disorders-2367510.shtml |date=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary accounts of ''anorexia mirabilis'' do exist, most notably that of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] girl in [[Colombia]], as reported by medical anthropologist Carlos Alberto Uribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Virginidad, anorexia y brujería: el caso de la pequeña Ismenia|url = http://antipoda.uniandes.edu.co/view.php/39/1.php|website = ANTÍPODA {{!}} Revista de Antropología y Arqueología Nº 3|accessdate = 2015-10-31|author = Carlos Alberto Uribe Tobón|author2 = Rafael Vásquez Rojas|author3 = Santiago Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russian bread and salt.jpg|thumb|Bread and salt, a traditional greeting in some Slavic countries.]]
'''Bread and salt''' is a welcome [[greeting]] ceremony in several [[Slavs|Slavic]] and other European cultures and in Middle Eastern cultures. The tradition, known by local [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: ''Хлеб і соль''; {{lang-bg|Хляб и сол}}; {{lang-mk|Леб и сол}}; {{lang-hr|Kruh i sol}}; {{lang-sr|Хлеб и со}} / ''Hleb i so''; {{lang-pl| Chleb i Sól}}; {{lang-sk|Chlieb a soľ}}; {{lang-cz|Chléb a sůl}}; {{lang-sl|Kruh in sol}}; {{lang-ru|Хлеб-соль}}, {{lang-ua|Хліб і сіль}} was also adopted by three non-Slavic nations — [[Lithuanians]], [[Latvians]] (both Baltic) and [[Romanians]] (Latin) — all three of which are culturally and historically close to their Slavic neighbours ({{lang-lt|Duona ir druska}}. {{lang-lv|Sālsmaize}} and {{lang-ro|Pâine și sare}}). It is also common in Albania ({{lang-sq|bukë, kripë e zemër}}), Armenia ({{lang-hy|աղ ու հաց}}, ''agh u hats''), the [[Jewish diaspora]], and the [[Middle East]]. This tradition has also been observed in [[human spaceflight|spaceflight]].&lt;ref name=TDC&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunn|first1=Marcia|title=The Daily Courier (Yavapai, AZ)|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&amp;dat=19950317&amp;id=gyYOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6611,2108414|work=news.google.com|date=March 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika&gt;{{cite web|last1=McHale|first1=Suzy|title=Ceremonies {{!}} RuSpace|url=http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/ceremonies.html|website=suzymchale.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural associations==

[[File:Buka_e_misrit_dhe_buka_pogaçe.jpg|thumb]]
===Albania===
Bread, salt and heart ({{lang-sq|bukë, kripë e zemër}}) is a traditional Albanian way of honoring guests, it dates back from the [[Kanun_(Albania)|Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini]] Chapter 18 - para.608: "The Guest shall be welcomed with Bread, salt and heart". Heart in the context is related with hospitality, the concept is based on giving the most expensive thing of that time which was salt to the awaited guest. Nowadays it is not commonly practiced during daily life.

===Belarus, Russia and Ukraine===
[[File:US Navy 060703-N-2468S-001 Vice Adm. Jonathan Greenert, commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet, takes part in a cultural exchange ceremony during a routine port visit to Vladivostok, Russia.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Navy|US Naval officer]] takes part in a bread and salt ceremony after arriving in [[Vladivostok]], Russia, July 3, 2006.]]
When important, respected, or admired guests arrive, they are presented with a [[loaf]] of [[bread]] (usually a [[korovai]]) placed on a ''[[rushnyk]]'' ([[embroidery|embroidered ritual cloth]]). A salt holder or a [[salt cellar]] is placed on top of the bread loaf or secured in a hole on the top of the loaf. On official occasions, the "bread and salt" is usually presented by young women dressed in national costumes (e.g., [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]]).

The tradition gave rise to the Russian word that expresses a person's hospitality: ''"khlebosolny"'' (literally: "bready-salty"). In general, the word "bread" is associated in [[Russian culture]] with hospitality, bread being the most respected food, whereas salt is associated with long friendship, as expressed in a Russian [[saying]] "to eat a [[pood]] of salt (together with someone)". Also historically the [[Russian Empire]] had a high [[salt tax]] that made salt a very expensive and prized commodity (see also the [[Moscow uprising of 1648]]).

[[File:Biden Kyiv Bread.jpg|thumb|[[Vice President of the United States|American Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] dips a piece of bread in salt as part of a welcoming ceremony upon his arrival in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], July 20, 2009.]]
There also is a traditional Russian greeting "Khleb da sol!" (''Хлеб да соль!'' "Bread and salt!"). The phrase is to be uttered by an arriving guest as an expression of good wish towards the host's household. It was often used by beggars as an implicit hint to be fed, therefore a mocking rhymed response is known:  "Khleb da sol!" &amp;mdash; "Yem da svoy!" (''Хлеб да соль'' &amp;mdash; ''ем да свой!'' "Bread and salt!" &amp;mdash; "I am eating and it is my own!").

[[File:Southgate bread and salt.jpg|thumb|[[Gareth Southgate]] and [[Harry Kane]] taking part in a bread and salt ceremony after arriving in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, 13 June 2018]]
In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], it is customary to greet the [[bishop]] at the steps of the church when he arrives for a pastoral visit to a church or [[monastery]] with bread and salt.

===Bulgaria===
Bread and salt ({{lang-bg|хляб и сол}}, transliterated ''hlyab i sol'') is a traditional Bulgarian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed. The bread and salt is commonly presented to guests by a woman.  Bulgarians usually make a certain type of bread for this occasion called ''[[Pogača|pogacha]]'', which is flat, fancy, and decorated. Regular bread is not usually used, although it may have been historically, but ''pogacha'' is much more common in this custom.

Usually, guests are presented with the ''pogacha'', and the guest is supposed to take a small piece, dip into the salt and eat it. This custom is common for official visits regardless of whether the guest is foreign or Bulgarian. One notable example of this custom is when the Russians came to liberate Bulgaria from the Ottomans at the end of the 19th century. A common scene from that period was of a Bulgarian village woman welcoming Russian soldiers with bread and salt as a sign of gratitude.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
This tradition is still practiced in the Czech Republic (''chléb a sůl'') and Slovakia (''chlieb a soľ'') for special occasions, for example, when presidents from other countries are visiting. It is not commonly practiced during daily life.

===Poland===
In Poland, welcoming with bread and salt ("''chlebem i solą''") is often associated with the traditional hospitality ("''staropolska gościnność''") of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]''), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century [[Polish poet]], [[Wespazjan Kochowski]], wrote in 1674: "O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!"&lt;!--"O dobryż chleb, gdy jest z solą dany gościom z dobrą wolą"--&gt; Another poet who mentioned the custom was [[Wacław Potocki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Wacław Potocki - 'Chlebem, czapką, solą'|url = http://www.republika.pl/o_chlebie/potocki.html|website = |accessdate = 2015-06-13|publisher = republika.pl|archivedate = March 4, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080304214957/http://www.o_chlebie.republika.pl/potocki.html|language = Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish [[proverb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Chlebem i solą.

===Republic of Macedonia===
In the [[Republic of Macedonia]], this tradition still is practiced occasionally as a custom expressing hospitality. A certain type of bread, similar to that in Bulgaria and also by the same name — ''[[pogača]]'' (from [[Latin]] ''panis focacius'') is prepared.

The famous Macedonian and ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] ethno-jazz-rock group of even more famous world music guitarist, [[Vlatko Stefanovski]], had the name "[[Leb i Sol]]", which means "bread and salt" and speaks itself about this term of hospitality as something basic and traditional.

===Romania===
As in Slavic countries, bread and salt is a traditional Romanian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed.

===Serbia===
Bread and salt (''hleb i so'') is a traditional welcoming of guests,&lt;ref name="Albala2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Albala|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTo6c_PJWRgC&amp;pg=RA3-PA329|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37626-9|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; being customary to offer it before anything else,&lt;ref name="ZamurovićSlani2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dragoljub Zamurović|author2=Ilja Slani|author3=Madge Phillips-Tomašević|title=Serbia: life and customs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXAMAQAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=ULUPUDS|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bread having an important place in Serbian tradition, used in rituals.&lt;ref name="GallHobby2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Timothy L.

It is part of the state protocol, in use since the [[Principality of Serbia]], often used when welcoming foreign representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogača i so kroz vekove čuvaju goste|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:559524-Pogaca-i-so-kroz-vekove-cuvaju-goste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania===
In Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, bread and salt were traditionally given as a symbol of blessing for a new home. Instead of white bread, dark fiber-rich rye bread was used.

===Germany===
Bread and salt are given away for different reasons:
* to the wedding for a lasting alliance between spouses
* to move into a house to wish sedentary, prosperity and fertility.

In northern Germany and Bohemia (Czech Republic) bread and salt are traditionally put into the [[diaper]] of a newborn. In Transylvania bread and salt are served to protect against weather demons.

===Arab culture===
Arab culture also have a concept of "bread and salt" (خبز وملح or عيش وملح) but not in the context of welcoming, but as an expression of alliance by eating together, symbolizing the rapprochement between two persons. Eating bread and salt with a friend is considered to create a moral obligation which requires gratitude. This attitude is also expressed by Arab phrases such as "there are bread and salt between us" (بيننا خبز وملح or بيننا عيش وملح), and "salt between them" (بينهما ملح) which are terms of alliance.

===Jewish culture===
The practice exists also among Jews in the Diaspora and in Israel. The ceremony of [[Kiddush]] includes dipping a piece of [[Challah]] in salt.  Bread and salt are also used in welcoming ceremonies and given to the welcomed persons.  It is common in Israel for a landlord or real estate agent to leave bread and salt in the home to welcome new tenants, as these should be the first things brought into a new home.

It is an important part of the culture.  It is given on all good occasions: during weddings, house warming parties, and childbirth.

===Iranian culture===
{{clarify span|In the [[Iranian culture]] when a guest is welcomed into the home, it's said that they have eaten Bread and salt, and this leads to loyalty of the guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86+%D9%88+%D9%86%D9%85%DA%A9 | title=نان و نمک | publisher=Dehkhoda Dictionary | accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|date=February 2016}}

===United Kingdom===
In Northern England and Scotland the tradition is observed on New Year's Day, where the first individual to enter a house may be required by tradition to bring bread, salt and coal.

===In Space===
With the advent of the [[Soviet space program]], this tradition has spread into space, where appropriately small packages of bread and salt are used nowadays.&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika/&gt; It was observed at the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] and the [[Salyut programme]], when [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and salt tablets were used in the spaceship. &lt;!--as described in [[Soyus 27]] article--&gt; Bread chunks and salt were a welcome at the [[Mir]] space station,&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika/&gt; a tradition that was extended on the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=Kosmonavtika/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Feast-of-bread-and-salt-awaits-space-station-crew/2005/04/17/1113676650147.html |title=Feast of bread and salt awaits space station crew - World |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bread and salt are also a welcome for cosmonauts returning to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/146225/capsule_brings_3_astronauts_back_to_earth/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

{{in popular culture|date=August 2018}}
The custom of serving bread and salt to guests is a recurring reference in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, where the welcome ritual serves as not only as a [[Westeros]]i tradition of hospitality but also a formal assurance of "guest right", a sacred bond of trust and honor guaranteeing that nobody in attendance, hosts and guests alike, shall be harmed.  Violating the guest right is widely considered among the highest moral crimes, an affront worthy of the worst [[damnation]], rivaled only by kinslaying. [[Game of Thrones]], the associated television series, prominently features the tradition in season three, episode 9, "The Rains of Castamere." Rival noble houses Stark and Frey are meeting to discuss a marriage alliance. The Starks fear betrayal by the Freys, but their worries are assuaged when the most important members of each house eat bread and salt from the same platter, establishing guest right, although the Freys eventually break the oath by murdering most of the Starks present at the wedding.

In Season 2, Episode 4 of [[Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)|Peaky Blinders]], Alfie Solomons offers [[Charles Sabini]] bread and salt as Sabini offers a white flag of truce. 

[[Rudyard Kipling]] referenced bread and salt in a number of works. In ''[[The Ballad of East and West]]'', leavened bread and salt is mentioned as binding an oath of blood brothership.  At the beginning of ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' Puck establishes his credentials with the child protagonists by asking them to sprinkle plenty of salt on their shared meal. ""That'll show you the sort of person I am."

In [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]'s historical novel Outcast, bread and salt is referred to as a sign of belonging to a tribe: "You are my people, my own people, by hearth fire and bread and salt".

In the ''Count of Monte Cristo'' by Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 72 is titled "Bread and Salt." The character Mercedes attempts to coax the main character into eating fruit, as part of an Arabian custom to ensure that those who have shared food and drink together under one roof would be eternal friends. 

In D.R. Merrill's 2014 science fiction novel ''Lamikorda'' the Alplai greet the leaders of the Terran colony vessel with a ritual meal of foods representing their major cultures, including bread from the Saakh; one of the Terrans then presents a small container of [[sea salt]], which is graciously accepted and added as a symbol of their friendship.

Bread and salt are given as a housewarming gift in one scene of the 1946 film ''[[It's A Wonderful Life]]''.

Animals that are held by humans and prevented from escaping are said to be in '''captivity'''.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions, 1911 CHAPTER 27 1 and 2 Geo 5; "...the expression “captive animal” means any animal (not being a domestic animal) of whatsoever kind or species, and whether a quadruped or not, including any bird, fish, or reptile, which is in captivity, or confinement, or which is maimed, pinioned, or subjected to any appliance or contrivance for the purpose of hindering or preventing its escape from captivity or confinement..."; Protection of Animals Act 1911; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/27&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually applied to wild animals that are held in confinement, but may also be used generally to describe the keeping of [[domesticate]]d [[animal]]s such as [[livestock]] or [[pet]]s. This may include, for example, animals in [[farm]]s, private homes, [[zoo]]s and laboratories. Animal captivity may be categorized according to the particular motives, objectives and conditions of the confinement.

==History==

Throughout history not only domestic animals as pets and [[livestock]] were kept in captivity and under human care, but also wild animals. Some were failed domestication attempts. Also, in past times, primarily the wealthy, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and kings collected wild animals for various reasons. Contrary to domestication, the ferociousness and natural behaviour of the wild animals were preserved and exhibited. Today's zoos claim other reasons for keeping animals under human care: [[conservation biology|conservation]], [[education]] and [[science]].

[[Image:Mexican wolf lounging.jpg|right|thumb|An [[endangered]] [[Mexican wolf|Mexican gray wolf]] is kept in captivity for breeding purposes.]]

== Behavior of animals in captivity ==
Captive animals, especially those not domesticated, sometimes develop [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]].

One type of abnormal behaviour is ''[[stereotypical behavior]]s'', i.e. repetitive and apparently purposeless motor behaviors. Examples of stereotypical behaviours include pacing, self-injury, route tracing and excessive self-grooming. These behaviors are associated with stress and lack of stimulation. Many who keep animals in captivity attempt to prevent or decrease stereotypical behavior by introducing stimuli, a process known as [[Behavioral enrichment|environmental enrichment]].

A type of abnormal behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or [[eye poke]] that may result in injuring oneself.&lt;ref name=Rommeck&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rommeck |first1=Ina |first2=Kristen |last2=Anderson |first3=Allison |last3=Heagerty |first4=Ashley |last4=Cameron |first5=Brenda |last5=McCowan |title=Risk factors and remediation of self-injurious and self-abuse behavior in rhesus macaques |journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science |year=2009 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10888700802536798 |doi=10.1080/10888700802536798|pmc=4443667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed across a range of primate species, especially when they experience [[social isolation]] in infancy.&lt;ref name=Hosey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosey |first1=Geoff R. |first2=Lindsay J. |last2=Skyner |title=Self-injurious behavior in zoo primates |journal=International Journal of Primatology |year=2007 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1431–1437 |doi=10.1007/s10764-007-9203-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10764-007-9203-z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in [[primates]]) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. [[Hair plucking]] is a jerking motion applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt;

The proximal causes of self-injurious behavior have been widely studied in captive [[primates]]; either social or nonsocial factors can trigger this type of behavior. Social factors include changes in group composition, stress, separation from the group, approaches by or aggression from members of other groups, [[conspecific]] male individuals nearby, separation from females, and removal from the group.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; [[Social isolation]], particularly disruptions of early mother-rearing experiences, is an important risk factor.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Studies have suggested that, although mother-reared [[rhesus macaques]] still exhibit some self-injurious behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Erwin |first2=G. |last2=Mitchell |first3=Terry |last3=Maple |title=Abnormal behavior in non-isolate-reared rhesus monkeys |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1973 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=515–523 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; nursery-reared rhesus macaques are much more likely to self-abuse than mother-reared ones.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Nonsocial factors include the presence of a small cut, a wound or irritant, cold weather, human contact, and frequent zoo visitors.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; For example, a study has shown that zoo visitor density positively correlates with the number of gorillas banging on the barrier, and that low zoo visitor density caused gorillas to behave in a more relaxed way. Captive animals often cannot escape the attention and disruption caused by the general public, and the stress resulting from this lack of environmental control may lead to an increased rate of self-injurious behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Deborah L. |title=A note on the influence of visitors on the behavior and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2005 |volume=93 |issue=1-2 |pages=13–17 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(05)00181-4/pdf |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of self inflicted harm, some animals exhibit harm towards others and internal psychological harm. This can be exhibited in various forma, such as Orca whales, which never have killed a human in the wild, killing two of its own trainers. Psychological tics can also be identified, ranging from swaying to head bobbing to pacing. Continuous inbreeding is also bringing out mental disadvantages, such as crossed eyes and infertility.

Studies suggest that many abnormal captive behaviors, including [[Self-injurious behavior#Other animals|self-injurious behavior]], can be successfully treated by pair housing. Pair housing provides a previously single-housed animal with a same-sex social partner;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Kate C. |first2=Mollie A. |last2=Bloomsmith |first3=Brooke |last3=Oettinger |first4=Kimberly |last4=Neu |first5=Caroline |last5=Griffis |first6=Valérie |last6=Schoof |first7=Margaret |last7=Maloney |title=Benefits of pair housing are consistent across a diverse population of rhesus macaques |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2012 |volume=137 |issue=3-4 |pages=148–156 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.09.010 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(11)00304-2/pdf |subscription=yes|pmc=4307811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this method is especially effective with primates, which are widely known to be [[social animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.L. |last=Weed |first2=P.O. |last2=Wagner |first3=R. |last3=Byrum |first4=S. |last4=Parrish |first5=M. |last5=Knezevich |first6=D.A. |last6=Powell |title=Treatment of persistent self-injurious behavior in rhesus monkeys through socialization: A preliminary report |journal=Contemporary Topics in Laboratory Animal Science |year=2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=21–23 |pmid=14510519 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social companionship provided by pair housing encourages social interaction, thus reducing abnormal and anxiety-related behavior in captive animals as well as increasing their [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]].&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28684">'''Celebratory gunfire''' (also called '''aerial firing''' or '''happy fire''') is the shooting of a [[firearm]] into the air in celebration.  It is culturally accepted in parts of the [[Balkans]], the [[Middle East]], the Central Asian region of [[Afghanistan]], and the South Asian region of [[Pakistan]].  In regions such as [[Puerto Rico]] and continental areas of the [[United States]] it is practiced illegally, especially on holidays like New Year's Eve.&lt;ref name="dawn"/&gt;

Common occasions for celebratory gunfire include [[New Year's Day]] as well as religious holidays such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]].&lt;ref name=SETimes/&gt; The practice may result in random death and injury from [[stray bullet]]s. Property damage is sometimes another result of celebratory gunfire; shattered windows and damaged roofs are often found after such celebrations.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;

==Falling-bullet injuries==
[[Image:Telop-mkd.jpg|thumb|right|"Bullets are not greeting cards. Celebrate without firearms." From the IANSA Macedonian poster campaign, December 2005]]
Bullets fired into the air usually fall back with [[terminal velocity|terminal velocities]] much lower than their [[muzzle velocity]] when they leave the barrel of a firearm.  Nevertheless, people can be injured, sometimes fatally, when bullets discharged into the air fall back down to the ground.  Bullets fired at angles less than vertical are more dangerous as the bullet maintains its [[Trajectory of a projectile|angular ballistic trajectory]] and is far less likely to engage in tumbling motion; it therefore travels at speeds much higher than a bullet in [[free fall]].

A study by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that 80% of celebratory gunfire-related injuries are to the head, feet, and shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a2.htm |title=New Year's Eve Injuries Caused by Celebratory Gunfire --- Puerto Rico, 2003 |accessdate=2007-07-31 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Puerto Rico]], about two people die and about 25 more are injured each year from celebratory gunfire on New Year's Eve, the CDC says.&lt;ref name=Abdul-Alim/&gt; Between the years 1985 and 1992, doctors at the [[King/Drew Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], treated some 118 people for random falling-bullet injuries.

Firearms expert [[Julian Hatcher]] studied falling bullets in the 1920s and calculated that .30 [[caliber]] rounds reach terminal velocities of &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;90&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(300&amp;nbsp;feet per second or 186&amp;nbsp;miles per hour)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatcher, Julian Sommerville|title=Hatcher's Notebook |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |year= 1962|isbn=0-8117-0795-4|page= 514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A bullet traveling at only &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;61&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(200&amp;nbsp;feet per second)&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;100&amp;nbsp;m/s&amp;nbsp;(330&amp;nbsp;feet per second)&lt;/span&gt; can penetrate human skin.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58890-308-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stewart, Michael J. |title=Head, Face and Neck Trauma: Comprehensive Management |publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers |location=New York |year= 2005|isbn=1-58890-308-7|page= 189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[International Action Network on Small Arms]] (IANSA) ran education campaigns on the dangers of celebratory gunfire in [[Serbia and Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
In Serbia, the campaign slogan was "every bullet that is fired up, must come down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/C00FD2BC-CD6E-4774-A127-F38C1133CC4F.html |title=Serbs Told To Keep Guns Quiet On New Year's Eve – RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property damage==
Bullets often lodge in [[roof]]s, causing minor damage that requires repair in most cases. Normally, the bullet will penetrate the roof surface through to the roof deck, leaving a hole where water may run into the building and cause a leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsboadvertisingservice.com/library1.htm#BULLETS |title=Professionals Topics Library : Roofs &amp; Bullets |accessdate=2007-08-02 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817004232/http://www.fsboadvertisingservice.com/library1.htm#BULLETS |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The number of complaints regarding random shooting in [[Dallas, Texas]], on New Year's Eve declined from approximately 1,000 in 1999 to 800 each in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt;
*In early 2008, increased partisanship in [[Lebanon]] led to the practice of firing celebratory gunfire in support when politicians appeared on local television, leading to multiple deaths and to calls from these leaders to end the practice.&lt;ref name=Fallout/&gt;

==Notable incidents==
&lt;!-- Notable incidents should involve either multiple fatalities, tracing the bullet to the shooter, change in policy or procedure, or some other form of notability above and beyond a random injury. --&gt;

The non-fiction U.S. [[cable television]] program ''[[MythBusters]]'' on the [[Discovery Channel]] covered this topic in [[MythBusters (2006 season)#Episode 50 .E2.80.93 .22Bullets Fired Up.22|Episode 50: "Bullets Fired Up"]] (original airdate: April 19, 2006). [[Special-effects]] experts [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]] conducted a series of experiments to answer the question: "Can celebratory gunfire kill when the bullets fall back to earth?"

Using [[pig]] carcasses, they worked out the terminal velocity of a falling bullet and had a mixed result, answering the question with all three of the show's possible outcomes: Confirmed, Plausible and Busted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode_06.html |title=Discovery Channel :: Mythbusters: Episode Guide |accessdate=2007-07-31 |work=StarPhoenix |publisher=CanWest Interactive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823212625/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode_06.html |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They tested falling bullets by firing them from both a [[handgun]] and a [[rifle]], by firing them from an [[air gun]] designed to propel them at terminal velocity, and by dropping them in the desert from an instrumented balloon.

They found that while bullets traveling on a perfectly vertical trajectory tumble on the way down, creating turbulence that reduces terminal velocity below that which would kill, it was very difficult to fire a bullet in a near-ideal vertical trajectory. In practice, bullets were likely to remain spin-stabilized on a ballistic trajectory and fall at a potentially lethal terminal velocity. They also verified cases of actual deaths from falling bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/04/episode_50_bullets_fired_up_vo_1.html |title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 50: Bullets Fired Up, Vodka Myths III |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charities that this event raised money for were:
*[[Ronald McDonald House]]
*[[Yellow Ribbon]] (Prevention of Youth Suicide)
*Child Cancer Foundation

==Performances==
These are among some of the acts performed at the Cirque Rocks event.
*[[Plate Spinning]]
*Holland's Motorcycle Globe of Death
*Sunchasing
*[[X-Games]] bikers - - Chad Kagy, Ryan Nyquist, Jamie Bestwick and Scott Cranmer.
*[[Trampolining]]
*Cage of Death
*Ramashov [[Russian swing]]s
*Troupe Mayarov Fast Track Tumbling
* Motorcycle Foot Jugglers from Russia
* The Flying Wallendas (the world's greatest high wire act)

Cirque Rocks was a contemporary circus event and therefore did not use any performing animals.

==Disappearance==
On August 29, 2006, it was reported that a [[China|Chinese]] performer associated with the Chasing Sun chair balance act failed to turn up for her flight back to [[China]]. No further details are apparent and her disappearance remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://welshmandownunder2.blogspot.com/2010/02/cirque-rocks-2006.html welshmandownunder, Cirque Rocks, February 6, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical lycanthropy''' is defined as a rare [[psychiatric]] syndrome that involves a [[delusion]] that the affected person can transform into, has transformed into, or is a non-human [[animal]].&lt;ref name=Garlipp&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garlipp P, Gödecke-Koch T, Dietrich DE, Haltenhof H |title=Lycanthropy--psychopathological and psychodynamical aspects |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=19–22 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14674954 |doi=10.1046/j.1600-0447.2003.00243.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0001-690X&amp;date=2004&amp;volume=109&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is associated with the [[mythology|mythical]] condition of [[lycanthropy]], a [[supernatural]] affliction in which humans are said to physically [[shapeshift]] into wolves. It is purported to be a rare disorder.&lt;ref name="Degroot"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.J.M. |last=Degroot |title=Religious System of China |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |pages=484 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal or have already transformed into an animal. It has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany [[psychosis]] (the [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]] that typically involves delusions and [[hallucination]]s) with the [[Shapeshifting|transformation]] only seeming to happen in the mind and [[behavior]] of the affected person.

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keck PE, Pope HG, Hudson JI, McElroy SL, Kulick AR |title=Lycanthropy: alive and well in the twentieth century |journal=Psychol Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=113–20 |date=February 1988 |pmid=3363031 |doi=10.1017/S003329170000194X}}&lt;/ref&gt; on lycanthropy from the [[McLean Hospital]] reported on a series of cases and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which lycanthropy could be recognised:

* A patient reports in a moment of lucidity or reminiscence that they sometimes feel as an animal or have felt like one.
* A patient behaves in a manner that resembles animal behavior, for example howling, growling, or crawling.

According to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of [[mental illness|mental]] or [[neurology|neurological illness]] associated with its behavioral consequences.

It also seems that lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation; a wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A review&lt;ref name=Garlipp/&gt; of the medical literature from early 2004 lists over thirty published cases of lycanthropy, only the minority of which have [[wolf]] or [[dog]] themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into a [[hyena]], [[cat]], [[horse]], [[bird]] or [[tiger]] has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into [[frog]]s, and even [[bee]]s, has been reported in some instances. In Japan, transformation into [[fox]]es and dogs was usual ([[:ja:狐憑き]], [[:ja:犬神]]).

A Case Report |journal=Psychopathology |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=344–7 |year=1989 |pmid=2639384 |doi=10.1159/000284617}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to horse, and then finally cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as "unspecified".

There is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and [[Cotard delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Nejad, A. G., Toofani, K. (2005). "Co-Existence of Lycanthropy and Cotard's Syndrome in a Single Case". ''Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica'' 111: 250–252.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ophidianthropy'' refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake. Two case studies have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Kattimani, S, Menon, V., Srivastava, M.K. &amp; Aniruddha Mukharjee, A. (2010). [http://www.priory.com/psychiatry/ophidianthropy.htm "Ophidianthropy: The Case of a Woman Who 'Turned into a Snake{{'"}}] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416100712/http://www.priory.com//psychiatry/ophidianthropy.htm |date=2014-04-16 }}.

==Proposed mechanisms==
Clinical lycanthropy is a rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic episode caused by another condition such as [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]] or [[clinical depression]].

However, there are suggestions that certain [[neurological]] conditions and [[culture|cultural]] influences may result in the expression of the human-animal transformation theme that defines the condition.

===Neurological factors===
One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the [[human brain|brain]] known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see [[proprioception]] and [[body image]]). A [[neuroimaging]] study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings.&lt;ref name="Moselhy 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moselhy HF |title=Lycanthropy: New Evidence of its Origin |journal=Psychopathology |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=173–176 |year=1999 |pmid=10364725 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=psp32173 |doi=10.1159/000029086 |access-date=2009-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615022547/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=psp32173 |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related disorders==
In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals.&lt;ref name="Nejad 2007"&gt;Nejad, A. G. (2007). ''Belief in Transforming Another Person into a Wolf: Could it be a Variant of Lycanthropy?'' Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 115: 159–161.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been termed "lycanthropic intermetamorphosis"{{r|Moselhy 1999}} and "lycanthropy spectrum".{{r|Nejad 2007}} A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug [[MDMA]] (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a [[boar]], a [[donkey]] and a [[horse]].&lt;ref&gt;Nasirian ''et al''. (2009).

''Addiction and Health'' 1: 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Catherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the [[Bible]] refer to [[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar]]'s behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as a being manifestation of clinical lycanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kroeger, Catherine Clark |title=The Women's Study Bible: New Living Translation |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-529125-4 |edition=Second |author2=Evans, Mary J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKT7ftnh0xYC&amp;pg=PA1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of [[Odysseus]]'s crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larner |first=Andrew J |title=Neurological Signs: Lycanthropy |journal=Advances in Clinical Neuroscience and Rehabilitation |date=September–October 2010 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=50 |accessdate=6 January 2012 |url=http://www.acnr.co.uk/SO10/ACNRSO10_50_neuro_signs.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030105014/http://www.acnr.co.uk/SO10/ACNRSO10_50_neuro_signs.pdf |archive-date=30 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, it is believed that the king of [[Armenia]] [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]] also suffered from this disorder. He was cured by [[Gregory the Illuminator]]. As a sign of gratitude, Tiridates proclaimed [[Christianity]] as the state religion during 301, thus making Armenia the first Christian state.

According to [[Persian literature|Persian tradition]], the [[Buyid]] prince [[Majd ad-Dawla]] was suffering from an illusion [[Boanthropy|that he was a cow]]. He was cured by [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://article.tebyan.net/72602/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612031430/http://article.tebyan.net/72602/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%87-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A2%D9%86-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%AE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7 |archive-date=2017-06-12 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to [[Melancholia]] or an "excess of black bile".{{sfn|Sconduto|2008|p=131}} During 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves suffered from an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, "a dry tongue and a great thirst" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes.{{sfn|Sconduto|2008|p=131}} Even King [[James VI and I]] in his 1597 treatise ''[[Daemonologie]]'' does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but "an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to 'counterfeit' the actions of these animals".{{sfn|Sconduto|2008|p=156}} The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, N. (2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19571">'''Critical consumption''' is the conscious choice of buying or not buying a specific product according to ethical and political beliefs. The critical [[consumerism|consumer]] recognizes the importance of considering some characteristics of the product and its realization, such as environmental [[sustainability]] and respect of workers’ rights. Indeed, critical consumers take full responsibility for the [[environmental impact|environmental]], social and political effects of their choices. The critical consumer can sympathize with certain [[social movement]] goals and contributes towards them through modifying their consumption behavior.

Work on critical consumption has differed in the terms used to refer to boycotting and buycotting actions. The more prominent include [[Ethical consumerism|ethical consumption]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=it&amp;lr=&amp;id=iFtkiRK8ZoMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=Harrison,+R.,+Newholm,+T.+and+Shaw,+D.+(2005)+The+Ethical+Consumer,+London:+Sage.&amp;ots=5pr9vRtHho&amp;sig=SVmSshVUkiRyKAVBhWGtd__r9cA#v=onepage&amp;q=Harrison%2C%20R.%2C%20Newholm%2C%20T.%20and%20Shaw%2C%20D.%20(2005)%20The%20Ethical%20Consumer%2C%20London%3A%20Sage.&amp;f=false Harrison, R., Newholm, T. and Shaw, D. (2005) The Ethical Consumer, London: Sage.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[political consumerism]],&lt;ref&gt;Micheletti, M. (2003) Political Virtue and Shopping, New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[sustainable consumption]], more linked with policy, has also increased in usage.&lt;ref&gt;Spaargaren, G. (2003) ‘Sustainable consumption: A theoretical and environmental policy perspective’, Society and Natural Resources 16: 687/701.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often consumer and citizen are considered as different because consumers only show self-interest, whereas citizens denote expanded self-interest. The general idea is that, consumers ‘buy what they want—or what they have been persuaded to want—within the limits of what they can get.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10460-005-6042-4 Berry, W. (1989). The pleasures of eating. The Journal of Gastronomy, 5, 125–131.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citizenship]], on the other hand, carries duties or responsibilities along with various rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.662.5395&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Wilkins, J. F. (2005). Eating right here: Moving from consumer to food citizen. Agriculture and Human Values, 22, 269–273]&lt;/ref&gt; Since consumers are seen also as citizens they have to behave in a community-oriented, moral and political way, rather than as a self-interested one.

== Political use of consumption ==

A specificity of critical consumption is the political use of consumption, which is the consumers’ choice of “''producers and products with the aim of changing ethically or politically objectionable institutional or market practices''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bridgingdifferences.mcgill.ca/en/Youth.pdf Micheletti, M., Stolle, D. "Concept of Political Consumerism" in ''Youth Activism - An International Encyclopedia'' (2006), Lonnie R. Sherrod (ed.), Westport: Greenwood Publishing.]&lt;/ref&gt; Their choices depend on different factors as non economic issues that concern personal and family well-being, issue of fairness, justice, ethical or political assessment. Main forms and tools of political use of consumption are [[boycotting]], "buycotting" ([[anti-boycott]]ing) and also [[culture jamming]] or [[adbusting]].

Political consumerism can be considered as an alternative form of political engagement, especially for young generations. In addition, market-based political strategies of young citizens go beyond boycotting and “buycotting”; they also started to participate in [[internet campaign]]s becoming active consumers. Their individual choices become political movements able to challenge political and economic powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naomiklein.org/no-logo/publication-info Klein, N. (2000), No Logo, Knopf Canada: Picador.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VidaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=Merlucci,+A.+(1988),+‘‘Social+Movements+and+the+Democratization+of+Everyday+life’’+in+J.+Keane+(ed.)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A2pidAlVOu&amp;sig=DZHNKpWdu42Y08WYjNckh2NDNKk&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtoPj-3 Merlucci, A. (1988), ‘‘Social Movements and the Democratization of Everyday life’’ in J. Keane (ed.), Civil Society and the State: New European Perspective, London: Verso.]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as a political actor, the consumer “is seen as directly responsible not only for him or herself but also for the world”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users2.unimi.it/rsassatelli/wp-content/uploads/Sassatelli-Critical-consumerism-BrewerTrentmann-2006.pdf Sassatelli, R. (2006) "Virtue, Responsibility and Consumer Choice. Framing Critical Consumerism"]&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of political consumerism takes into account social transformations like globalization, the ever-increasing role of the market and individualization.

New Brunswick, Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that consumes are becoming increasingly politicized according to the boycott and buycott principles. In particular, Scandinavian people seems to be more committed in political consumerism, for example [[Sweden]] increased his average of boycotting episodes from 15 percent in 1987 to 29 percent in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Petersson, Olof, Hermansson, J6rgen, Micheletti, Michele, Teorell, Jan and Westholm, Anders (1998). Demokrati och medborgarskap.Stockholm: SNS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that even if a growing number of citizens are turning to the market to express their political and moral concerns,  it is difficult to assess whether political consumerism can also be considered as a meaningful or effective form of political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://profs-polisci.mcgill.ca/stolle/Data_files/FinalIJPS2005.pdf Micheletti, M., Stolle, D., Hooghe, M, (2005) Politics in the Supermarket: Political consumerism as form of political participation. International Political Science review]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Background ==

[[File:Boston Tea Party.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston Tea Party]] was an important example of boycotting against England |253x253px]]
The chase for a fair consumption has deep roots in consumption history, starting for example with the [[American Revolution]]. Sympathizers of the American cause, in those years, refused to buy English goods, to support colons rebellion. This act of conscious choice can be seen as the beginning of both critical and political consumption. Traces of these two concepts can be found at the turn of the nineteenth century, in the [[United States]], where the [[National Consumers League|National Consumer League]] promoted the so-called “[[Whitelist]]s”, in which all the companies that treated fairly their employees were listed.

At the end of the century, also the first forms of political activism in consumption took place in the United States and Europe, like the “Dont Buy Jewish” boycotts. Several organizations were born in those times and in the following centuries, asking the consumers to join the mobilizations as active subjects.

A variety of discourses about the “duty” and the “responsibilities” of social actors arose after the 1999 [[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]]. People were explicitly asked to think that to shop is to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users2.unimi.it/rsassatelli/wp-content/uploads/Sassatelli-Critical-consumerism-BrewerTrentmann-2006.pdf Sassatelli, R. (2006) Virtue, Responsibility and Consumer Choice. Framing Critical Consumerism, 219]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boycotting and "Buycotting" ==
[[Boycott]]ing and "buycotting" ([[Anti-boycott]]), as a particularly self-conscious form of consumption, are expressions of an individual’s political, ethical or environmental stance. Both boycotting and "buycotting" are discrete acts of critical consumption and they are mutually contingent. In fact, if the use-value or utility of a product is important, then it is difficult to view them as separate actions.
[[File:La2-buynothing.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]] demonstration in San Francisco, November 2000]]
'''Boycotting''' refers to abstaining from buying, avoiding specific products or brands to punish companies for undesirable policies or business practices. "'''Buycotting'''" is a term coined by Friedman (1996); it refers to “positive buying” that aims to foster corporations that represent values – fair trade, environmentalism, sustainable development – that consumers choose to support.

When one boycotts a product or service, it does not mean that he abstains from consuming at all, but that he may select an alternative product or service. Equally, a choice to "buycott" could be understood as including a rejection or boycott of the non-ethical alternative. This interdependence is useful to explain the traditional pairing of boycotting and "buycotting" in much analysis of consumer politics.

One of the rising types of boycotting is the ad hoc one, which underlines the importance of consumers as political subjects. These initiatives show that critical consumption is really impacting in special occasions, gaining much more visibility than everyday boycotts. An example of this type of events is the [[Buy Nothing Day|Buy Nothing Day (BND)]].

== Sustainability ==
The notion of [[sustainability]] has both a temporal dimension demonstrated by the trade-off between present and future generations, and a justice dimension which considers the different distribution of harm and benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Gamborg, C., &amp;Sandøe, P. (2005a). Applying the notion of sustainability—Dilemmas and the need for dialogue. In S. Holm &amp; J. Gunning (Eds.), Ethics, Law and Society (pp. 123–130). Hants: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the term sustainability, notions of sustainable [[resource consumption]] by [[recycling]], [[environmental protection]], [[animal welfare]], [[social justice]], and climate responsibilities are gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Gamborg, C., &amp;Sandøe, P. (2005b). Sustainability in farm animal breeding. A review. Animal Production Science, 92(3), 221–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Although the "good" purposes of critical consumerism there are some critics and pitfalls connected to this practice of consumption: 
* [[Fair trade]] protocols invite to respect all the communities and their cultures, workers’ rights and so on. At the same time, however, it appears as a hegemonic tool to impose a western culture of which the right standards must be.
* It requires a huge production of green and ethical products, but it is difficult to realize in the small-scale local production.
* People live in an asymmetrical world in terms of information. They take decisions just with the use of few elements.
* “A ‘paradox of sustainability’ arises because more substantive approaches to sustainability may be too complex to effectively motivate appropriate social responses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/23760319/Agricultural_sustainability_what_it_is_and_what_it_is_not Thompson, P. B. (2007). Agricultural sustainability: What it is and what it is not. International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability, 51, 5–16.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, all human food consumption has some kind of impact—hence there will always be some kind of prioritization”.

=== Criticism related to political use of consumption ===

* The idea that every person could be a potential political consumer is not true: ethical products can cost much more than traditional ones and people may not afford so expensive products (e.g. [[organic products]]).
* It is important to consider that people often buy products to express themselves. People who don’t care about ethical consumption will keep on buying products they like, not depending on political consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1992_num_80_1_1564_t1_0249_0000_3 De Certeau, M. (1990). L'invention du quotidien, 1. Arts de faire. Paris, Gallimard.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Shaw and Newholm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.10008/abstract Shaw, D. and T. Newholm (2002). "Voluntary Simplicity and the Ethics of Consumption." Psychology and Marketing 19(2): 167-185.]&lt;/ref&gt; even though single individuals take decisions and choices, political consumption can also be seen as a mass phenomenon. Consumes depend on consumers’ social environment. Moreover, [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://monoskop.org/images/e/e0/Pierre_Bourdieu_Distinction_A_Social_Critique_of_the_Judgement_of_Taste_1984.pdf Bourdieu, P. (1984). Distinction: a social critique of the judgement of taste. Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that consumption is determined by the belonging to a specific [[social class]] which determines our [[habit]]s and what we like.

== Examples ==
There are many examples of critical consumerism:
[[File:Rosaparks.jpg|thumb|235x235px|[[Rosa Parks]] with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]], 1955]]
* Montgomery boycott was a political and social protest campaign against the policy of [[racial segregation]] on the public transit system of Montgomery, [[Alabama]]. The campaign started on December 5, 1955 - when [[Rosa Parks]], an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to leave her seat to a white person. After that episode, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations.
* A well-known effective boycott took place against [[Nestlé]] (1977–84) for its marketing campaign of breast milk substitute or infant formula, in the third world. This boycott mobilized consumers on a global-scale and it brought Nestlè to the [[World Health Organization]] and United Nations International Children Emergency Fund ([[UNICEF]]) negotiating table. In 1981, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was adopted. However, political consumerist groups were not satisfied with the Code implementation and reinstated the boycott in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Yam, Naomi Bromberg (1995). "The Nestle Boycott: The Story of the WHO/UNICEF Code for Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes," Mothering (winter): 56-63.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nike, Inc.|Nike inc.]] has been accused for many years of exploiting children labour to produce [[footwear]] and [[apparel]], even though the company has always denied such charge. However, the brand has been highly damaged by both political consumption activism and the publicity it has received on the media. [[Watchdog group|Watchdog groups]] have forced Nike to raise wage levels, changing its sourcing of soccer balls to avoid child labor, raising the minimum age of its factory workers abroad, and insist that all outsourced footwear suppliers adopt US occupational safety andhealth standards for indoor air quality.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Richard M. (2003). "The Promise and Perils of Globalization: The Case of Nike", MIT IPC Working Paper 02-008. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are also several examples of culture consumption association. One of the best known is the “[[No Sweat (organisation)|No Sweat]]" movement that is a broad-based no-profit organization which fights for the protection of [[sweatshop]] labourers, fights against child labour, forced overtime, poverty wages, unsafe conditions, harassment of women workers and intimidation of trade unionist, not only in developing countries, but also in Britain and the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Cultural dissonance''' (education, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and cultural studies) is an  uncomfortable sense of discord, disharmony, confusion, or conflict experienced by people in the midst of change in their cultural environment. The changes are often unexpected, unexplained or not understandable due to various types of cultural dynamics.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"&gt;[http://adt.curtin.edu.au/theses/available/adt-WCU20020610.140633/  English speaking migrant children in educational and cultural transition.] Curtin University of Technology. (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies into cultural dissonance take on a wide socio-cultural scope of analysis that inquire into [[economics]], [[politics]], [[values]], [[learning styles]], cultural factors, such as [[language]], [[tradition]], [[ethnicity]], [[cultural heritage]], cultural [[history]], educational formats, classroom design, and even socio-cultural issues such as [[ethnocentricism]], [[racism]] and their respective historical legacies in the cultures.

==Research==
Research topics in cultural dissonance tend to be [[interdisciplinary]] drawing from a wide range of disciplines and applying the findings to equally diverse fields and industries.

Edward J. Hedican wrote an article in the Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology at the [[University of Guelph]], [[Ontario]]. In it he  noted the possibility of alleviating acculturative pressures, and their disruptive effects on the sense of aboriginal sense of worth and identity. He proposed, "...the development of interethnic communication or ethnopolitics of community competence. This, in turn, will lead to increased native control over educational, economic, &amp; political institutions, decreased cultural dissonance, &amp; a more positive native identity." (Hedican)

Paul Bohannan wrote an "anthropological treatise" outlining "Seven organizing principles unique to humans: contract, role, ranking property, markets, networks, &amp; public relations. These characteristics are built on to analyze dyads, triads, &amp; chains, to show how innovation, as well as how cultural dissonance can lead to cultural traps." (Bohannan)

=== Education ===
Winifred L. Macdonald concluded in her thesis that, "... shared markers of language and ethnicity were not sufficient to ensure that the cultural differences in education systems were not experienced by the families." 
Macdonald also observed that cultural dissonance is sometimes said to inhibit socio-cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"/&gt;

Susan Black, an education research consultant, wrote an article in the ''[[American School Board Journal]]'' of the [[National School Board Association]] that summarized some of the actions recommended by some researchers in education-related cultural dissonance. The recommendations for educators included:
# Recognize [[ethnocentrism]]
# Know and understand the student's [[cultural heritage]]
# Understand social, economic and political issues and [[value (ethics)|values]] in different cultures
# Adopt the attitude that students—all students—can [[learn]]
# Create genuinely caring classrooms where all students are appreciated and accepted.

Other general findings include: 
*Geneva Gay (University of Washington in Seattle, Washington), proposed that differences can erupt into cultural clashes
*Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory notes that many anecdotal case studies show how culturally responsive practices improve students' behavior and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Susan. American School Board Journal; Jan 2006, Vol. 193 Issue 1, p34-36, 3p&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-generation immigrants ===
In their book ''Children of Immigration'', Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco discuss dissonance as it relates to [[Latino]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco, [http://www.hepg.org/her/booknote/112 "Children of Immigration"], Harvard University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez Orozco found that second-generation [[Hispanics]] face more acute forms of cultural dissonance than their first generation parents. They also noticed that second-generation individuals also face "special difficulties" that lead to "three general patterns of adjustment"
# attempts to [[:wikt:synthesize|synthesize]] two cultural traditions
# [[Passing (sociology)|passing]] as a member of the dominant group
# developing of defensive identity such as [[gang]] membership

=== Refugees of war ===
Suárez-Orozco also compared the experience of exiles from [[Cuba]] being reunited with family members with the "...alienated refugees from war-torn Central America..." as they worked through their own adjustment issues, and concluded that Central Americans had to deal with more cultural dissonance than their Cuban counterparts.

=== Law enforcement ===
Larry A. Gould wrote a paper for [[Northern Arizona University]]
"his research reports on the link between feelings of spirituality &amp; how Navajo police officers tend to enforce European-based law. Previous research suggests that a link exists between the officers' depth of feeling of spirituality &amp; the officers' attitude toward the effectiveness traditional methods of social control; however, this research goes a step further &amp; examines the impact of cultural dissonance on the stressors faced by Navajo police officers. The enforcement behavior of the Navajo officers was used as a proxy for the intensity of their feelings concerning the usefulness of traditional vs European-based forces of social control; the underlying assumption being tested is that self-determination is not only a state of law but a state of psychological being. A snowball method of sample development was used to select officers for intensive interviews. The findings suggest that the officers' feeling of spiritual connectedness to his/her culture is inversely related to the strictness of the enforcement of European-based laws. In other words, the more spiritual the officer, the less likely the officer is to rely solely on European-based laws, &amp; the greater the reliance on other methods of problems solving. The finding also suggest that in addition to the stressors normally encounter by all police officers, Navajo officers faced additional stressors that are specific to indigenous officers policing in indigenous communities. 1 Table, 41 References. Adapted from the source document." (Gould)

=== In sports ===
Tracy Taylor wrote a paper for the ''[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]]''. In it she wrote "...This research investigates issues of cultural diversity &amp; inclusiveness in women's netball in Australia using the rhetoric of exclusion. Women &amp; girls from culturally diverse backgrounds spoke of reinforced difference &amp; cultural assimilation in their netball experiences. Women born in other English-speaking countries recalled feelings of inclusion &amp; limited cultural dissonance &amp; indicated that netball helped them feel as part of their new community &amp; gain social capital via participation. Although experiences of explicit exclusion or racial discrimination were virtually nonreported, some women felt a strong sense of cultural conformity to Anglo-centric expectations of behavior. The women's stories &amp; experiences suggest that women from culturally diverse backgrounds have found few opportunities to express their cultural distinctiveness through mainstream Australian sports such as netball. The conclusion reached after this examination is that the rhetoric of exclusion is pervasive in Australian netball &amp; unlikely to change in the near future. 1 Table, 76 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]" (Taylor)

==Cultural dissonance in popular culture==
Side 2 of the [[Firesign Theatre]]'s 1968 album, ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', features a humorous 18-minute radio drama of a traveler experiencing cultural dissonance on his arrival in a foreign country. For example, the traveler struggles to communicate his wish to send a telegram, only to be informed that yes, his telegram has been sent, at considerable cost, and that he will be receiving it in about an hour.

'''[[Culture]] [[speculation]]''' is the practice of engaging in or [[Promotion (marketing)|promoting]] an area or [[region]] through either direct [[investment]] or [[Population transfer|relocation]] in order to attract a pool of culture or cultured individuals.  For example, the return of a [[jazz]] club owner to [[New Orleans]] with the intent of kindling a "jazz [[renaissance]]" from the recently displaced musicians would be an example of culture speculation.

'''Dark tourism''' (also '''black tourism ''' or '''grief tourism''') has been defined as [[tourism]] involving travel to places historically associated with [[death]] and [[tragedy (event)|tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Lennon"/&gt; More recently, it was suggested that the concept should also include reasons tourists visit that site, since the site's attributes alone may not make a visitor a "dark tourist".&lt;ref name=Rami/&gt; '''Thanatourism''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir5BZWeOoiAC&amp;pg=PA266 |   title=Heritage, Museums and Galleries: An Introductory Reader|author=Gerard Corsane|year= 2005|page= 266|isbn= 978-0415289467|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the ancient Greek word ''[[thanatos]]'' for the personification of death, refers more specifically to peaceful death; it is used in fewer contexts than the terms ''dark tourism'' and ''grief tourism''. The main attraction to dark locations is their historical value rather than their associations with death and suffering.&lt;ref name=Rami /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonomad.com/features/0704/dark-tourism.html|work=gonomad.com|title=Shedding Light on Dark Tourism|author= Courtney C.

==Field of study==
While there is a long tradition of people visiting recent and ancient settings of death, such as travel to [[gladiator]] games in the Roman [[colosseum]], attending public executions by [[decapitation]], and visiting the [[catacombs]], this practice has been studied academically only relatively recently.
Travel writers were the first to describe their tourism to deadly places. [[P. J. O'Rourke]] called his travel to [[Warsaw]], [[Managua]], and [[Belfast]] in 1988 'holidays in hell',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Rourke|first=P. J.|title=Holidays in Hell|year=1989|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=978-0330306836}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Chris Rojek talking about 'black-spot' tourism in 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojek|first=Chris|title=Ways of Escape: Modern Transformations in Leisure and Travel|year=1993|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0333475782|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ways_of_escape.html?id=Ex1HAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 March 2014|quote=(P 142)The leisure forms constructed around black spots certainly give signs of repetition-compulsion and seeking the duplication of experience. (p170) The gravity and solemnity of Black Spots have been reduced by moves to make them more colorful and more spectacular than other sights on the tourist trail. For example, in 1987 the government of Thailand unveiled plans to restore the famous Death Railway …}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the 'milking the macabre'.&lt;ref name=Dann&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Tourism: The Next Decade|year=1994|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|location=Oxford|pages=55–67|last=Dann|first= G|chapter=Tourism the nostalgia industry of the future|editor=W. Theobald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic attention to the subject originated in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]: The term 'dark tourism' was coined in 1996 by Lennon and Foley, two faculty members of the Department of Hospitality, Tourism &amp; Leisure Management at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]],&lt;ref name="Lennon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foley|first=Malcolm|author2=J. John Lennon|title=JFK and dark tourism: A fascination with assassination|journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies|year=1996|volume=2|issue=4|pages=198–211| doi=10.1080/13527259608722175|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13527259608722175#preview|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'thanatourism' was first mentioned by A. V. Seaton in 1996, then Professor of Tourism Marketing at the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seaton|first=AV|title=Guided by the dark: from thanatopsis to thanatourism|journal=Int Journal of Heritage Studies|year=1996|volume=2|issue=4|pages=234–244|doi=10.1080/13527259608722178|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeXWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=thanatourism#v=onepage&amp;q=thanatourism&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 March 2014|isbn=9781136394966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, there have been many studies on definitions, labels, and subcategorizations, such as  [[Holocaust tourism]] and slavery-heritage tourism, and the term continues to be molded outside academia by authors of travel literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writings On The Dark Side Of Travel|date=March 15, 2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0857453419| editor=Jonathan Skinner}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little [[empirical research]] on the perspective of the dark tourist.&lt;ref name=Rami&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rami Khalil Isaac |author2=Erdinç Çakmak |title=Understanding visitor's motivation at sites of death and disaster: the case of former transit camp Westerbork, the Netherlands|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2013|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/13683500.2013.776021}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dark tourism has been formally studied from three main perspectives by a variety of different disciplines:

===Hospitality and tourism===
Scholars in this interdisciplinary field have examined many different aspects. Lennon and Foley expanded their original idea &lt;ref name="Lennon"/&gt; in their first book, deploring that "tact and taste do not prevail over economic considerations” and that the "blame for transgressions cannot lie solely on the shoulders of the proprietors, but also upon those of the tourists, for without their demand there would be no need to supply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark tourism: The attraction of death and disasters|year=2000|publisher=Thomson Learning|location=London|author=Lennon, J.|author2=Foley, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
Philip Stone and Richard Sharpley from the Department of Tourism and Leisure Management of the [[Lancashire Business School]] at the [[University of Central Lancashire]], UK have looked through the lens of the market place at dark tourism; they have coined the term 'product of dark tourism', and discuss its supply, demand, and consumption by the 'dark tourist'. Stone and Sharpley have published prolifically in this area, although not conducted empirical research, and founded an Institute for Dark Tourism. 
In 2005 Stone suggested that "within contemporary society people regularly consume death and suffering in touristic form, seemingly in the guise of education and/or entertainment", and sounded a call for research on "Dark Tourism Consumption" to "establish [[consumer behavior]] models that incorporate contemporary socio-cultural aspects of death and dying."&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=P|title=Dark Tourism Consumption – A call for research|journal=E-Review of Tourism Research|year=2005|volume=2|issue=5|pages=109–117|quote=contemporary society with its ...late capitalism broad defining features include an increased commercial ethic and commodification; a de-differentiation of time and space through global technological communication; and an introduction of anxiety and doubt over the project of modernity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 paper Stone discussed "the dark tourism product range", arguing that "certain suppliers [of dark tourism] may [...] share particular product features, perceptions and characteristics, which can then be loosely translated into various 'shades of darkness'." His typology of death-related tourist sites consists of seven different types, ordered from light to dark: dark fun factories, dark exhibitions, dark dungeons, dark resting places, dark shrines, dark conflict sites and dark camps of [[Genocide|genocide.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=P|title=A dark tourism spectrum: Towards a typology of death and macabre related tourist sites, attractions and exhibitions|journal=Tourism|year=2006|volume=54|issue=2|pages=145–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Stone and Sharpley hypothesized, that coming together in places associated with grief and death in dark tourism represents immorality, so that morality may be communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Consuming dark-tourism a thanatological perspective|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|year=2008|volume=35|issue=2|pages=574–595|author1=Stone, P.  |author2=Sharpley, R|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2008.02.003|url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/3995/1/1-s2.0-S0160738308000261-main.pdf__tid%3D90f05cc0912e830dc006127480a0a0f0%26acdnat%3D1344587777_cab3d67ccfefbcd5c8d9192d03f7182f}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===The exploitation of the deceased===
Whether a tourist attraction is educational or exploitative is defined by both its operators and its visitors.&lt;ref name="jeju"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=776|title=Exploitation or healthy interest? An analysis of dark tourism.|author= Darryl Coote|date= 2010-06-12|publisher=Jeju Weekly|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism operators motivated by greed can "milk the macabre"&lt;ref name=Dann /&gt; or reexamine tragedies for a learning experience. Tourists consuming dark tourism products may desecrate a place and case studies are needed to probe who gains and loses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNSFAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq|title=Contemporary issues in tourist development|editor1=Richard W. Butler |editor2=Douglas G. |page =122|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134623600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanatourism and slum-tourism have been described as re-interpreting the pastime according to the needs of financial elite.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli R (2016) Thana Tourism and the Cinematic Representation of Risk. Abingdon, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Misinformation===
[[Chris Hedges]] described the "[[Alcatraz]] narrative as presented by the [[National Park Service]]" as "[[whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]]", because it "...ignores the savagery and injustice of America's system of mass incarceration". By omitting challenging details, the park service furthers a "[[Disneyfication]]", per Hedges.&lt;ref name=hedges&gt;{{cite news|author1=Chris Hedges|title=Alcatraz: A Prison as Disneyland|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/alcatraz_a_prison_as_disneyworld_20141130|work=Truthdig.com|publisher=Zuade Kaufman|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example destinations==
Destinations of dark tourism include: castles and battlefields such as [[Battle of Culloden#Culloden battlefield today|Culloden]] in Scotland and [[Bran Castle]] and [[Poienari Castle]] in Romania; former [[prison]]s such as [[Beaumaris Prison]] in [[Anglesey]], Wales and the [[Jack the Ripper]] exhibition in the [[London Dungeon]]; sites of [[natural disaster]]s or [[Anthropogenic hazard|man made disaster]]s, such as [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum website|url=http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/index_e2.html|work=[[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=1 March 2014|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chernobyl]] in Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chernobylpripyat.com/ |publisher=chernobylpripyat.com |title=Chernobylzone |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225173644/http://www.chernobylpripyat.com/ |archivedate=February 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrainianweb.com/chernobyl_ukraine.htm|title=Chernobyl Tours|publisher= Ukrainianweb.com|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chernobyl-tour.com/english|publisher=Chernobyl-TOUR|title=Chernobyl tour, official provider of Chernobyl exclusion zone|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the commercial activity at [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York one year after [[September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/28/1023864657451.html|work=2002 The Age Company Ltd|author=Jayson Blair|date=June 29, 2002|title=Tragedy turns to tourism at Ground Zero|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes sites of human atrocities and [[genocide]], such as the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.auschwitz.org/m/|title=Memorial Museum Auschwitz Birkenau|publisher=[[Państwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau]] w Oświęcimiu|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] in China, the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] in Cambodia; the sites of the [[Jeju Uprising]] in South Korea&lt;ref name="jeju" /&gt; and the Spirit Lake Internment Camp Centre near [[Trécesson, Quebec|La Ferme, Quebec]] as an example of [[Ukrainian Canadian internment|Canada's internment operations]] of 1914–1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch of Quebec Internment Spirit Lake Interpretive Centre|url=http://www.internmentcanada.ca/PDF/articles/Spirit_Lake.pdf.|work=press release|publisher=[[Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund]]|accessdate=February 28, 2014|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launch of ''Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research'' ==
In late 2017, the online journal ''Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research'' was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shop by|journal=Current Issues in Dark Tourism Research|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the online journal is to bring affordable 'dark tourism' scholarship direct to students, researchers, and the media. The journal is unique in that it pays royalty fees to authors and, as a result, is a new model for contemporary academic publishing. Authors and scholars may submit their own related research for publication in the journal. A broad range of 'dark tourism and difficult heritage' research will be available in the journal, in the form of articles, case studies, and commentaries. The editor of the journal is Dr Philip Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Works of Dr Philip Stone|url=https://works.bepress.com/philip_stone/|website=Bepress|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design theory''' is a subfield of [[design research]] concerned with various theoretical approaches towards understanding and delineating design principles, design knowledge, and design practice.

== History ==

Design theory has been approached and interpreted in many ways, from personal statements of design principles, through constructs of the [[philosophy of design]] to a search for a [[design science]].

The essay "Ornament and Crime" by [[Adolf Loos]] from 1908 is one of the early 'principles' design-theoretical texts. Others include Le Corbusier's ''Vers une architecture'',&lt;ref name="Corbusier 1923"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture" (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Papanek]]'s ''Design for the real world'' (1972).

In a 'principles' approach to design theory, the [[De Stijl]] movement promoted a geometrical abstract, "ascetic" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the [[Bauhaus]] movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.

For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/cephad-centre-philosophy-design/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

An example of early design science was Altshuller's ''Theory of inventive problem solving'', known as [[TRIZ]], from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 ''The sciences of the artificial'' began a more scientific basis to the study of design. &lt;ref name="simon1996"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon|title='The Sciences of the Artificial|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=0-262-69191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the further development of fields such as [[design methods]], [[design research]], [[design science]] and [[design thinking]] has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.

'''Doors Open Days''' or simply '''open days''' provide free access to buildings not normally open to the public. The first Doors Open Day took place in France in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;http://us.france.fr/en/events/european-heritage-days-5&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2015}} and the concept has spread to other places in Europe (see [[European Heritage Days]]), North America,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doorsopenontario.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_39_1.html About Doors Open Ontario Retrieved 25 February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228053418/http://www.doorsopenontario.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_39_1.html |date=February 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] and elsewhere.

Doors Open Days promotes architecture and heritage sites to a wider audience within and beyond the country's borders. It is an opportunity to discover hidden architectural gems and to see behind doors that are rarely open to the public for free.

== Heritage Open Days in England== 
[[Heritage Open Days]] established in 1994 celebrate English architecture and culture allowing visitors free access to historical landmarks that are either not usually open to the public, or would normally charge an entrance fee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doors open days in Scotland==
Doors Open Days is organised by the [[Scottish Civic Trust]]. Alongside Scottish Archaeology Month,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottisharchaeologymonth.com scottisharchaeologymonth.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the open days form [[Scotland]]'s contribution to [[European Heritage Days]].  This joint initiative between the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]] aims to give people a greater understanding of each other through sharing and exploring cultural heritage.  49 countries across [[Europe]] take part annually, in September.

During [[Glasgow]]'s  year as [[European City of Culture]] in 1990, organisers ran an Open Doors event.  Its popularity encouraged other areas to take part the following year and were coordinated by the [[Scottish Civic Trust]].  Doors Open Days now take place throughout Scotland thanks to a dedicated team of area coordinators.  These coordinators work for a mixture of organisations:  [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]], civic trusts, [[cultural heritage|heritage]] organisations and archaeological trusts.

[[Scotland]] is one of the few participating countries where events take place every weekend in September, with different areas choosing their own dates.  More than 900 [[buildings]] now take part. In 2008, over 225,000 visits were made generating £2million for the Scottish economy.  It is estimated that 5,000 or more [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s give their time to run activities and open doors for members of the public.

Doors Open Days was supported in 2009 by Homecoming Scotland 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homecomingscotland2009.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a year-long initiative that marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of Scotland’s national poet, Robert Burns.  It was funded by the Scottish Government and part financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund.  Its aim was to engage Scots at home as well as motivate people of Scottish descent and those who simply love Scotland, to take part in an inspirational celebration of Scottish culture and heritage.

== Open house in Australia==
{{Commons category|Open days in Australia}}
Open House events are organised in Australia in partnership with Open House Worldwide. The first Open House event took place in [[Open House Melbourne|Melbourne]] in 2008. This was followed by [[Brisbane Open House|Brisbane]] in 2010, and [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 2012.

''Elfland Catacombs'' is one of the earliest examples of [[hypertext fiction]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . It was published by Winterhearth company in 1981{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, several years before [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[Afternoon, a story]]'' (which is generally thought to be "the first hypertext fiction"). Author Alan Lance Andersen created ''Elfland Catacombs'' as a children's fantasy adventure, using the [[Commodore BASIC]] computer language. The plot involved the reader visiting an aunt in the border country of Scotland and becoming lost after crossing into Elfland with the help of an elf named Jennings. Numerous plot paths led to different endings — some happy and others not quite so pleasant. Unlike the many computer game style adventures of the period, this was a true electronic storybook with hypertextual links. Paul Jordan Hollander later converted it from the obsolete Commodore Basic into HTML files. 
Whatever its literary or technological merits may have been, "Elfland Catacombs" had little or no influence on the development of hypertext fiction. It was distributed on 5" floppy disk in Central Iowa; indeed, it appears to have been almost entirely forgotten outside of Iowa. It is not mentioned in Bolter and Joyce's seminal Hypertext 87 essay on "Hypertext and Creative Writing", nor in Ted Nelson's _Literary Machines_, George P. Landow's _Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary Literary Criticism and Technology_, nor in J. Yellowlees' Douglas 1991 doctoral dissertaion on hypertext fiction .  It has never been cited in the Proceedings of the ACM Hypertext Conference.  In contrast, Joyce's [[Afternoon, a story]] has been the subject of numerous reviews, essays, studies, and dissertations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6178">The '''empirical study of literature''' is an interdisciplinary field of research which includes the [[psychology]], [[Sociology of literature|sociology]], [[Philosophy]], the contextual study of literature, and the [[History of literature|history]] of [[Reading (process)|reading]] [[Literature|literary]] [[Text (literary theory)|texts]].

The [[International Society for the Empirical Study of Literature]] and Media (IGEL) is one learned association which brings together experts in this field. Major journals in the field are ''[[Poetics (journal)|Poetics: Journal of Empirical Research on Culture, the Media and the Arts]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/poetics/|title=Poetics|work=Publisher's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Poetics Today: International Journal for Theory and Analysis of Literature and Communication]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poeticstoday.dukejournals.org/|title=Poetics Today|work=Publisher's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Scientific Study of Literature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/ssol/main|title=SSOL|work=Publisher's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empirical study of literature attracts scholarship particularly in the areas of reception and audience studies and in cognitive psychology when it is concerned with questions of reading. In these two areas research and studies based on the framework are steadily growing. Further fields where the framework in various revised and expanded versions attracts scholarship is (comparative) cultural studies and pedagogy. One of several dictionary definitions of the field is as follows:

“Movement within the study of literature concerned with the study of literature as a social system of [inter]actions. The main question is what happens to literature: it is written, published, distributed, read, censored, imitated, etc. The empirical study of literature originated as a reaction to, and an attempt at, solving the basic problem of hermeneutics; that is, how the validation of literary interpretation can be demonstrated. From reception theory it had already become clear that interpretations are not only tied to the text, but also, and even to a great extent, to the reader — both in terms of the individual and of social conventions. This led to the theory of radical (cognitive) constructivism, based on the thesis that the subject largely construes its empirical world itself. The logical consequence of all this, to be seen in the work of Siegfried J. Schmidt, is the separation of interpretation and the strictly scientific study of literature based on radical constructivism. The literary system of actions is observed from the outside — not experienced — and roughly characterized as depending on two conventions (hypotheses) that are tested continually. These conventions are the aesthetic convention (as opposed to the convention of facts in the daily language of reference) and the polyvalence convention (as opposed to the monovalency in the daily empirical world). Thus, the object of study of the empirical study of literature is not only the text in itself, but the roles of action within the literary system, namely, production, distribution, reception, and the processing of texts. The methods used are primarily taken from the social sciences, reception theory, cognitive science, psychology, etc. In general the steps to be taken in empirical research are the formation of a hypothesis, putting it into practice, testing, and evaluation. More concretely, for the study of reader response a wide array of techniques are used, ranging from protocol techniques and thinking aloud protocol to pre-structured techniques, such as the semantic seven point scale (C. Osgood) and the classification technique (card sorting), and forms of content analysis, discourse analysis, association techniques, etc. Some objections often raised to the empirical study of literature are the triviality of many of its research results such as confirmation of what was already known or suspected or its reductionism (artificiality of the framework and set-up, and limitation to reader response instead of the study of the text). It is clear, however, that the empirical study of literature by its specific approach of the object and its focus on methodology is an outstanding way to explore the socio-cultural aspects of the literary system. It makes an irreplaceable contribution to the development of a more rational, scientific, and socially relevant study of literature.” &lt;ref&gt;Hendrik van Gorp, R. Ghesquiere, D. Delabastita and J. Flamend: „Empirische literatuurwetenschap.“ In: ''Lexicon van literaire termen: stromingen en genres, theoretische begrippen, retorische procédés en stiljfiguren''. By Hendrik van Gorp, R.

'''Epiphanies''' are used as a literary device within literature that is when a character has a sudden insight or realisation that changes his or her understanding of themselves or their comprehension of the world. Literary epiphanies are, "puzzled but privileged moments, sudden gifts of vision, when one’s feeling of aliveness intensifies and the senses quicken.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plotz|first=John Milton Gabriel|date=1999|title=Patterns of Epiphany: From Wordsworth to Tolstoy, Pater, and Barrett Browning (review)|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=42|issue=2|pages=366–369|doi=10.1353/vic.2000.0028|issn=1527-2052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term epiphany as a literary device was not given that term until the author [[James Joyce]] gave it that term to the short stories he wrote between 1898 and 1904 which was central to his early work.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Joyce derived the word from the Greek word 'epiphany' that means the manifestation of a deity or a sudden realisation.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jamesjoyce.ie/epiphanies/|title=Epiphanies|work=The James Joyce Centre|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term epiphany as a literary device has become popular among English speakers.

== Etymology ==
Epiphany as a word is derived from the ancient Greek word ''epiphaneia'' "manifestation, striking appearance, festival held in commemoration of the appearance of a god at some particular place."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/epiphany|title=epiphany {{!}} Origin and meaning of epiphany by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has religious connotations in the early fourteenth century meaning "festival of the manifestation of Christ to the gentiles" and in the New Testament meaning an "advent manifestation of Christ."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Christians denoted from epiphany the meaning of a "visible manifestation of a hidden divinity either in the form of a personal appearance, or by some deed of power by which its presence may be known." &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Citation|last=Walzl|first=Florence L.|title=The Liturgy of the Epiphany Season and the Epiphanies of Joyce|date=2011-03-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5744/florida/9780813035291.003.0002|work=Foundational Essays in James Joyce Studies|pages=24–48|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=9780813035291|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a verb the word means "to display or show forth" and when used in the passive voice it translates to "shine forth." &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

I have tried to present it to the indifferent public under four of its aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life. The stories are arranged in this order. I have written it for the most part in a style of scrupulous meanness and with the conviction that he is a very bold man who dares to alter in the presentment, still more to deform, whatever he has seen and heard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/804496624|title=James Joyce A to Z : the essential reference to the life and work|last=Nicholas.|first=Fargnoli, A.|isbn=9780195110296|oclc=804496624|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Epiphanies are a main literary device employed within the fifteen short stories in ''Dubliners'' and tend to circulate around moments of realisation of despair and disillusionment.

[[Araby (short story)|Araby]] is the third short story in ''Dubliners'' that centres around the narrator recollecting on an experience of when he was a young boy where he experienced a moment of epiphanic disillusionment. The story narrates in first person a young boy who is infatuated with a girl who remains unnamed and is referred to as, "Mangan's sister."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=author.|first=Joyce, James, 1882-1941,|title=Dubliners|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/965806639|isbn=9781520068497|oclc=965806639|access-date=2018-10-09|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator is infatuated with her even though he has never truly spoken to her, yet he claims that her name was, ''"like a summons to all my foolish blood.''"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=author.|first=Joyce, James, 1882-1941,|title=Dubliners|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/965806639|year=2017|isbn=9781520068497|oclc=965806639|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the narrator learns of how Mangan's sister wishes to go to Araby, which is a [[bazaar]] that she cannot go to due to other religious obligations the narrator believes that if he can bring her back a gift that she would return his feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, when the time came to go to the bazaar the narrator is delayed because he needs his uncle to lend him some money although the uncle forgot about it and so the narrator heads out late to the bazaar.

Upon arrival to the bazaar, most of the stalls are closed as he is late. The narrator is confronted by what he is seeing in front of him and he turns away from Araby after his vision and expectations of it are destroyed with the banal reality of it that is presented to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Harry|date=1965|title="Araby" and the Writings of James Joyce|journal=The Antioch Review|volume=25|issue=3|pages=375–410|doi=10.2307/4610703|issn=0003-5769|jstor=4610703}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, he becomes disillusioned with his idealisation of Mangan's sister as well. In the last sentence this notion is captured: "''Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where his realisation becomes an epiphanic moment. He now views the world differently as he now realises his own vanity and stupidity as he now has more self-awareness of himself.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Eveline ===
[[Eveline]] centres around the character of the same name who has been given a chance to escape her life with a man called Frank who is in love with her, however, Eveline's family is the cause of her paralysis. Her mother and brother have died, one of her brothers is always away and her father is an abusive drunkard. It could be assumed that her father's nature would provide greater reason for her to leave but when the opportunity arises for her to escape she simply cannot as she states that "it was impossible" as she realises her situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eveline feels with Frank that, ''"all the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing...No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish."'' This is Eveline's epiphany that she cannot escape even though she wanted to she cannot leave behind her familial ties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== A Little Cloud ===
[[A Little Cloud]] is a part of the Dubliners short story collection centring around the protagonist, Little Chandler who reunites with an old friend, Ignatius Gallaher  who is a more worldly man than himself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Little Chandler wishes to change his life, but the harsh reality of Dublin intrudes upon his hopes and in his moment of epiphany when he realises that it is useless to try to change his reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/823326430|title=James Joyce's Epiphany and Virginia Woolf's "Moment of Importance"|last=MA|first=Jin|date=2011|publisher=Canadian Academy of Oriental and Occidental Culture|oclc=823326430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little Chandler's first epiphany begins when he reunites with Gallaher who is successful in the world after he left Dublin. During this conversation between the two men is when Little Chandler realises and starts to believe that the only way to be successful in life is to leave Dublin.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Little Chandler then returns home to a house full of hate and regret where he his wife controls him and he does not love her and who made him give up what he does love - poetry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Upon his return home, he looks into a photograph of his wife as he looks, "coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly," back to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/james-joyces-short-story-quot-little-cloud-quot-44153|title=In James Joyce's short story "A Little Cloud", what is the epiphany?  (the revelation of the main character and or the reader????) {{!}} eNotes|website=eNotes|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He feels a deep rush of despair and regret for marrying his wife as he realises that, "''dull resentment against his life awoke within him''."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His child begins to cry and wail whilst Little Chandler was pondering his life and he finds he does not know what to do to make the child stop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wife eventually rushes in and scolds Little Chandler: ''"'What have you done to him?'''" This is when the final epiphany starts to form itself as he looks into her eyes and his "''heart closed together''" upon gazing into her cold eyes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The last sentence capsulises the epiphany as, "''Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the paroxysm of the child's sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.''"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The tears of remorse that begin to fill up his eyes are symbolic of his emotion of regret for his life and the uselessness his feels in never being able to change the trajectory of his life in the way that he wants.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The Dead ===
The short story [[The Dead (short story)|''The Dead'']] express the paralysis of the epiphany Joyce’s character Gabriel experiences in discovering his wife’s grief over her first love. The line "''It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life,''” provides a tonal shift from Gabriel lusting after his wife to being dumbstruck by the realisation that he may not be enough for his wife. When Gretta (wife) listens to D’Arcy singing ''The Lass of Aughrim'', she is reminded of her first love’s death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gabriel realises that while he has been lusting after her she has been comparing him to another man. This section of the story is influenced by Joyce’s love of Irish music.

== William Wordsworth's "Spots of time" ==
[[William Wordsworth]] was a [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] in the 1800s. He became a renowned poet with his collaboration with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Samual Taylor Coleridge]] when they wrote the collection of poems together, the ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''. In Wordsworth's time, epiphanies had not yet been given that term and were referred to by Wordsworth as "spots of time."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDuff|first=Sangam|date=2015|title=Death and the Limits of Epiphany: Wordsworth's Spots of Time and Joyce's Epiphanies of Death|journal=James Joyce Quarterly|volume=53|issue=1–2|pages=61–73|doi=10.1353/jjq.2015.0056|issn=1938-6036}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an agreement that the modern term for the literature device "epiphany" began with Romanticism and in particular with the works of William Wordsworth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wordsworth's innovation of "spots of time" in his poems have affected modern fiction and the modern short story.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langbaum|first=Robert|date=1983|title=The Epiphanic Mode in Wordsworth and Modern Literature|journal=New Literary History|volume=14|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.2307/468689|issn=0028-6087|jstor=468689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Prelude ===
The main plot points of ''[[The Prelude]]'' centre around the exploration of epiphany through what Wordsworth is trying to express as being vital to the history of his imagination.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Jonathan|date=1959-03|title=Wordsworth and the "Spots of Time"|journal=ELH|volume=26|issue=1|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/2872079|issn=0013-8304|jstor=2872079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two central themes to ''The Prelude'' are of childhood and memory and the adventures that Wordsworth has had as a child in the [[Lake District]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These memories are how he recollects on these moments of his childhood in his adult life is where his 'spots of time' or epiphanies as they are more commonly referred to, arise from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/william-wordsworth/0/steps/9853|title=Wordsworth's 'Spots of Time'|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Book Twelve of The Prelude: Imagination and Taste, How Impaired and Restored ====
In the twelfth book of ''The Prelude'', Wordsworth in his poem elaborates on the experience of the rejuvenating virtue that is given to him through his epiphanic moments that he recalls from childhood experience.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=1770-1850.|first=Wordsworth, William,|title=The prelude : the 1850 text|date=2013|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/973775028|publisher=Naxos|isbn=9781843797340|oclc=973775028|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are in our existence spots of time,/ That with distinct pre-eminence retain,/ A renovating virtue, whence--depressed/ By false opinion and contentious thought,/ Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,/ In trivial occupations, and the round/ Of ordinary intercourse--our minds/ Are nourished and invisibly repaired;/ A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,/ That penetrates, enables us to mount,/ When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen./ This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks/ Among those passages of life that give/ Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,/ The mind is lord and master--outward sense/  The obedient servant of her will. Such moments/ Are scattered everywhere, taking their date/ From our first childhood."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The language Wordsworth uses within this excerpt suggests that he has had many 'spots of time' that he could draw upon from his memory that could give him strength as they release to him a sense of epiphany in his new realisation of seeing the world in a recollection of youth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Notable Authors that use Epiphanies ==
The use of epiphanies as a stylistic and structural device in narrative and poetry came to prominence in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was a popular literary device of the modern author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/technique/epiphany4.html|title=Epiphanies and Time|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology|image=[[File:Cultura material (Museu Valencià d'Etnologia).jpg|250px]]}}
'''Ethnology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἔθνος'', ''ethnos'' meaning "nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ethno-|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethno-?q=ethno|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the branch of [[anthropology]] that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different [[peoples]] and the relationships between them (cf. [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[social anthropology|social]], or [[sociocultural anthropology]]).&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=ethnology|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnology?q=ethnology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific discipline==
{{further information|Ethnicity}}
Compared to [[ethnography]], the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.

[[File:AFKollar 1779.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Adam František Kollár]], 1779]]
The term ''ethnologia'' (''ethnology'') is credited to [[Adam František Kollár|Adam Franz Kollár]] (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his ''Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates'' published in [[Vienna]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Zmago Šmitek and Božidar Jezernik, "The anthropological tradition in Slovenia." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. ''Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” &lt;ref&gt;Kollár, Adam František  − Historiae jurisque publici regni Ungariae amoenitates, I-II. Vienna., 1783&lt;/ref&gt;

Kollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual [[History of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]] and his roots among its [[Slovak people|Slovaks]], and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the more distant [[Balkans#Population composition by nationality and religion|Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghiţă Geană, "Discovering the whole of humankind: the genesis of anthropology through the Hegelian looking-glass." In: Han F. Vermeulen and Arturo Alvarez Roldán, eds. Fieldwork and Footnotes: Studies in the History of European Anthropology.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of [[human history]], and the formulation of [[culture|cultural]] [[universal (metaphysics)|invariants]], such as the [[incest taboo]] and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about "[[human nature]]", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers ([[Hegel]], [[Marx]], [[structuralism]], etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] doctrine, with ''[[cultural anthropology]]'' becoming dominant especially in the [[United States]], and ''[[social anthropology]]'' in [[Great Britain]].  The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.

[[File:Levi-strauss_260.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]]]
The 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the [[Western world]]), such as the notion of the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".  This term was used in conjunction with "savages", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the "[[noble savage]]". Thus, [[civilization]] was opposed in a dualist manner to [[barbary]], a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared [[ethnocentrism]]. The progress of ethnology, for example with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structural anthropology]], led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear [[progress (history)|progress]], or the pseudo-opposition between "societies with histories" and "societies without histories", judged too dependent on a limited view of [[history]] as constituted by accumulative growth.

Lévi-Strauss often referred to [[Montaigne]]'s [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] on [[cannibalism]] as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a [[structuralism|structural method]], at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the [[incest taboo]]. However, the claims of such cultural [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including [[Marx]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Derrida]], [[Althusser]], and [[Deleuze]].

The French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, [[Paul Rivet]], [[Marcel Griaule]], [[Germaine Dieterlen]], and [[Jean Rouch]].

{{main|Political Economy in anthropology}}
'''''Europe and the People Without History''''' is a book by [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Eric Wolf]].  First published in 1982, it focuses on the expansion of European [[society|societies]] in the [[Modern Era]]. "Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A global history==
The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from [[World-systems theory|World Systems theory]] in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, [[Fur trade in North America|fur]] and [[Slave trade in Africa|slave trades]].  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American south and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mode of production analysis==
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">In any [[narrative]], the '''focal character''' is the [[Character (arts)|character]] on whom the [[audience]] is meant to place the majority of their interest and attention. They are almost always also the [[protagonist]] of the story; however, in cases where the "focal character" and "protagonist" are separate, the focal character's emotions and ambitions are not meant to be empathized with by the audience to as high an extent as the protagonist (this is the main difference between the two character terms). The focal character is mostly created to simply be the "excitement" of the story, though not necessarily the main character about whom the audience is emotionally concerned. The focal character is, more than anyone else, "the person on whom the spotlight focuses; the center of attention; the man whose reactions dominate the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For example, in [[Gaston Leroux]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the protagonist is [[Christine Daaé]] (the audience is concerned mostly with her emotions, aims, and well-being), while the focal character is the "[[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Phantom]]" (the audience is concerned mostly with the [[Attractiveness|allure]] of his actions and reactions&amp;mdash;though to some degree, later on, his emotions as well). In another example, in "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], the protagonist of the story is unnamed and does not have a great effect on the story, though he is present. He does not show much emotion throughout the story, and the reader is not as interested in him. The focal character of the story is Roderick Usher, whom the reader cares for more greatly and follows his condition and emotions more.

The focal character is also not necessarily the same thing as the [[viewpoint character]], through whose perspective the story is seen. In Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s works of [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Doctor Watson|Watson]] is the viewpoint character, but the story revolves around Holmes, making him the focal character.

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

==Art music==
{{main|Art music}}
[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music 2'' (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

==Tales and myths of impalement==

===Europe===

====Vampires and other undead====
The idea that the vampire "can ''only'' be slain with a stake driven through its heart" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]] and the more recent [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]] and [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]] series' all incorporate that idea.&lt;ref&gt;For popularity claim and example:[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155602/Vampire-skeletons-impaled-iron-stakes-say-arent-just-film-fantasy.html Thought vampires were just film fantasy? Skeletons impaled on iron stakes say otherwise]&lt;/ref&gt; In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, ''among several'', to "kill" a [[vampire]], or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment.&lt;ref&gt;''Barber'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In one story, an [[Istria]]n peasant named [[Jure Grando]] died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was [[decapitation|decapitated]], and the vampire terror was put to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Caron'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Roumanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a [[vrykolakas]]. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elementshealthspace.com/masthead/ Bio on Cronkite]&lt;/ref&gt; describes an odd grave found at [[Mytilene]], at [[Lesbos]], a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronkite''(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse [[draugr]], or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/[[tumulus|tumuli]]. The approved methods of killing a draugr are "to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes".&lt;ref&gt;''Andrews'' (1913), p.603. Several examples in the essay on grave robbery and encounters with draugr there and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. [[Edward Payson Evans]] tells the following story, from the city [[Kadaň]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Evans'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=delFlcGFniYC&amp;pg=PA196 p.196]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|In 1337, a herdsman near the town of Cadan came forth from his grave every night, visiting the villages, terrifying the inhabitants, conversing affably with some and murdering others. Every person, with whom he associated, was doomed to die within eight days and to wander as a vampire after death. In order to keep him in his grave, a stake was driven through his body, but he only laughed at this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost, saying: "You have really rendered me a great service by providing me with a staff, with which to ward off dogs when I go out to walk"}}

====Literary treatment of impalement====
A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in [[Ivo Andrić]]'s novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of impalement in book can be accessed here: [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Bridge+on+the+Drina+%28excerpts%29.-a0165021314 The Bridge on the Drina]&lt;/ref&gt; Andrić was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;On status as Nobel Laureate, predominantly on basis of Bridge, see: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans.html A Reader's Guide to the Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anecdotes of the impaled====
Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to [[Saint Barbara]]. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky.
All day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to ''de-impale'' himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Vierholz'' (1737) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jrY_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA493 p.&amp;nbsp;493–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a "Ladies' Journal", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there.&lt;ref&gt;''Damengesellschaft'' (1785) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3pMSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.&amp;nbsp;95–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
In [[British Columbia]], a folk tale from the [[Lillooet people|Lillooet People]] is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.&lt;ref&gt;The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband, through a clever ruse. ''Teit'' (1912), p. 339–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among tribes living around the [[Titicaca]], tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the [[Incas]], a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandelier'' (1904), impalement incident at p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martyrdom of al-Hallaj===
The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as "I am God". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance "I am God" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like "I am God". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last.&lt;ref&gt;Lit.Soc. Bombay (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=12soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111–113]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he ''does'', however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case.&lt;ref&gt;''Cantemir'' (1734), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3NUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632, under [[Murad IV]] (r.1623–40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;The French had been accused of bringing a Muslim woman on board a ship, ''Browne'' (1751) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=248&amp;id=XjYLAAAAYAAJ p.248]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it.&lt;ref&gt;''Sherwood, Jones'' (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=722&amp;id=8esTAAAAIAAJ p.722]&lt;/ref&gt; Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under [[Mustafa II]]: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Percy'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0k4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 p.147]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian sub-continent===
In the Hindu [[Draupadi]] cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re-enactments during holidays/festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=diPh4qYtjPUC The Cult of Draupadi]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Shaivite]] story from India, under the old [[Pandyan Dynasty]], ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King [[Koon Pandiyan]] had 8000 [[Jainism|Jains]] [[Impalement of the Jains in Madurai|impaled in Madurai]]. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sastri|1976|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roy|1984|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in "lurid mural representations" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Paul Dundas|Dundas]]'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C p.127] The author mentions as an example the temple to the war god [[Murugan]] in [[Kalugumalai]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] in [[Madurai]], around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of [[Meenakshi]]. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''AES'' (1904), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybyzrkuQaUEC&amp;pg=PA52 p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representations of impaled members of a different religion than Hinduism seems not to be confined to the Jains, but also to Buddhists. In a temple at Trivatur, not far from Madras (present name [[Chennai]]), for example, the walls "are covered with sculptures representing the execution of Buddhists by the most horrible tortures, the martyrs being impaled alive and left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey." ''Elliot'' (1869), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NRISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109] This presumably commemorates an alleged persecution of Buddhists in the 2nd century BC under Hindu King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], as narrated, for example, in 2nd century AD text [[Ashokavadana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the [[Pala Empire]], Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the [[Wise Men of Gotham]], bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[William Wilson Hunter|Hunter]]'' (1875) [https://archive.org/details/astatisticalacc00unkngoog p.313]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the [[Arthashastra]] states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire "by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible:&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (1922), p.422&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Or if invisibility is desired, having fasted three nights one should, on the day of the star Pushya, sprinkle with the milk of goats and sheep, barley planted in soil placed in the skull of a man who has been killed by a sword or has been impaled.}}
The [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Mandavya]], when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord [[Yama]], the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as [[Vidura]], the son of a mere serving maid.&lt;ref&gt;Combined from two slightly variant accounts, ''Ward'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294 p. 294–95] and ''Garbe'' (1913), p. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

A tale from [[Kashmir]] of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: "To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with [[Yogini]]s (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and "lustful for a man", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and "spent the rest of the night sporting with him". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as [[Aryaraja]], and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown'' (1919), p. 425–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Asia===
In the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as [[John Bowring]] relates from [[Siam]], those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=306&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.306]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale popular in Siam was about [[Devadatta]], a wily antagonist to [[Buddha]] seeking to undermine [[Gautama]]'s position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the [[Avici]], being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=313&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.313] For rather similar, vivid depictions of the sufferings in Hell from Buddhist temples in [[Cambodia]], see ''Vincent Jr.'' (1878), p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusions of impalement==
The 1980 Italian film, ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]], graphically depicts impalement.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]]; [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=sergio&gt;{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the "impaled" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the [[special effect]] was done: the actress sat on a [[bicycle seat]] mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of [[balsa]] wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=sergio/&gt;

In stage magic, the ''[[Impaled (illusion)|illusion of impalement]]'' is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.wellingtonent.com/products/impaled.html Impaled]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some [[dervish]] orders performed such acts already in the 18th century. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], traveling the Middle East 1761–67 on a Danish funded expedition, saw such a display at [[Basra]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Pinkerton'' (1811), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HWEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 p.172]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"The scene was in the open air, and in the court of the mosque, which was illuminated with only three lamps. Several Mullahs and dervises began with singing some passages out of the Koran. They continued to sing, with the accompaniment of some drums; and, during the music, the other dervises arose, took the sharp pointed irons, and did as if they were piercing their bodies, and even driving the irons with mallets into their flesh. Next appeared the principal actor, who, assuming an air of inspiration, directed the music to proceed, and to be raised to higher animation, in, order to assist his enthusiasm, or rather to stun the ears of the spectators. In his extacy, he threw up his turban in the air, loosened his hair; for this order of dervises wear their hair; and pierced his body with five lances: then mounting upon a low building, upon which a pole, sixteen feet long, and shod with a sharp iron point, had been set up, he impaled himself upon the pole, and was carried in this condition through the square. It was an affecting sight, to see a lean man, with a long beard, and dishevelled hair, wounded all over with spikes, and then carried about spitted upon a pole. I said, as I went away, to a Mullah of my acquaintance, that the dervise performed his tricks by means of a broad belt which he carried in his long wide drawers. The Mullah replied, that he had suspected some such art, but avoided mentioning his suspicions, lest he might draw upon himself the enmity of the order of [[Sheikh Bedreddin|Bed-reddin]]; for that one of his brethren had experienced great persecution from those dervises, in consequence of presuming to hint his doubts of the reality of their miracles."}}

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015). Physician behavioral adaptability: A model to outstrip a "one size fits all" approach. ''Patient Education &amp; Counseling'', ''98''(10), 1243-1247. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2015.07.028&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cross-cultural empathy: the ability to visualize with the imagination the situation of another person from an intellectual and emotional point of view. Demonstrating empathy includes the abilities of connecting emotionally with people, showing compassion, thinking in more than one perspective, and listening actively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ying Chung, R., &amp; Bemak, F. (2002). The Relationship of Culture and Empathy in Cross-Cultural Counseling. ''Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development'', ''80''(2), 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., &amp; Pope, m.

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015).

** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures are Denmark, Jamaica, Ireland, and Singapore.

=== [[Power (social and political)|Power]] distance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Refers to the degree in which cultures accept unequal distribution of power and challenge the decisions of power holders;
* Depending on the culture, some people may be considered superior to others because of a large number of factors such as wealth, age, occupation, gender, personal achievements, family history, etc.
** High power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe that social and class hierarchy and inequalities are beneficial, that authority should not be challenged, and that people with higher social status have the right to use power;
*** Cultures with high power distance are Arab countries, Guatemala, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
** Low power distance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Believe in reducing inequalities, challenging authority, minimizing hierarchical structures, and using power just when necessary;
*** Low power distance countries are Austria, Denmark, Israel, and New Zealand.

=== Short-term versus Long-term Time Orientation ===
''See also:'' [[Chronemics]]
* Short-term or Monochronic Orientation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Cultures value tradition, personal stability, maintaining "face," and reciprocity during interpersonal interactions;
** People expect quick results after actions;
** Historical events and beliefs influence people's actions in the present;

** Cultures believe that past results do not guarantee for the future and are aware of change;
** Polychronic cultures are China, Japan, Brazil, and India.

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;
* the [http://idiinventory.com/ Inter-cultural Intercultural Developmental Inventory]

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004).

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">A '''language code''' is a [[code]] that assigns letters or numbers as identifiers or classifiers for [[language]]s.  These codes may be used to organize library collections or presentations of data, to choose the correct localizations and translations in computing, and as a shorthand designation for longer forms of language-name.

== Difficulties of classification ==
Language code schemes attempt to classify the complex world of human languages, dialects, and variants. Most schemes make some compromises between being general and being complete enough to support specific dialects.

For example, most people in Central America and South America speak Spanish.  Spanish spoken in Mexico will be slightly different from Spanish spoken in Peru.  Different regions of Mexico will have slightly different dialects and accents of Spanish.  A language code scheme might group these all as "Spanish" for choosing a keyboard layout, most as "Spanish" for general usage, or separate each dialect to allow region-specific idioms.

== Common schemes ==

Some common language code schemes include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">[[File:Breton dialectes.svg|thumb|[[Lower Brittany]] (in various colours) and [[Upper Brittany]] in grey]]

The '''language boundary in Brittany''' is the [[language border]] between the part of [[Brittany]] where [[Breton language|Breton]] (a [[Celtic language]]) is spoken and the area in Brittany where [[Gallo language|Gallo]] (a [[Romance language]]) is spoken. The existence of this linguistic border led to differentiate the Celtic-speaking [[Lower Brittany]] (West) from the Romance-speaking [[Upper Brittany]] (East).

The farthest eastern extension of the Breton language was in the ninth century, when the linguistic border was located near [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]]. Breton declined inexorably in favor of the Gallo gradually moving westward along a [[Binic]]-[[Guérande]] line. The border can now be traced along a line from [[Plouha]] to [[Rhuys]]. The linguistic unification of France, completed after [[World War II]], made somewhat obsolete the linguistic aspect of the distinction between Upper and Lower Brittany, although many people still consider it valid in terms of [[toponymy]], culture and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Fañch Broudic, À la recherche de la frontière. La limite linguistique entre Haute et Basse-Bretagne aux xixe et xxe siècles, Brest, Ar Skol Vrezoneg, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
[[File:Dialectes Breton.png|thumb|right|Decline of the Breton language from the 10th to the 20th century.]]
[[File:Distribution relative des brittophones en 2004.png|thumb|Percentage of Breton-speaking people as of 2004, according to the [[Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg|Office de la langue bretonne]]. Dark red represents 25-30%, white represents 0-2%.]]

Place-names are one form of evidence for the linguistic boundary during the [[Early Middle Ages]], suggesting that it was much farther to the east than it is now, near [[Nantes]] and [[Rennes]]. For example, [[Pleugueneuc]], in [[Ille-et-Vilaine]], combines the Breton element ''plou'' (parish) with the name 'Guehenoc'.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jackson, ''[http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/zcph.1961.28.1.272 Linguistic Geography and the History of the Breton Language]'' (1961), online at reference-global.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction of two Brittanys was made at least as early as the 15th century, when the names used were ''Britannia gallicana'' (Gallic Brittany) and ''Britannia britonizans'' (Brittonic Brittany).&lt;ref name=cc&gt;John T. Koch (ed.), ''Celtic Culture: a historical encyclopedia'', Volumes 1-5 (2006), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, it appears that Lower Brittany had a separate [[tax|fiscal]] status. Since then, the boundary between them has changed slowly as a result of the long retreat of the Breton language.&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Abalain, ''Histoire de la langue bretonne'' (1995), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ''[[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]]'', the boundary between the two was generally in line with the province's division into nine [[episcopal see|bishoprics]], with those of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rennes|Rennes]], [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Dol]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nantes|Nantes]], [[Ancient Diocese of Saint-Malo|St Malo]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint-Brieuc|St Brieuc]] considered to form Upper Brittany, while [[Ancient Diocese of Tréguier|Tréguier]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Vannes]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quimper|Quimper]] and [[Diocese of Saint-Pol-de-Léon|Saint-Pol-de-Léon]] formed Lower Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Volume 4 (1894), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1588, the [[historian]] [[Bertrand d'Argentré]] defined the boundary as running from the outskirts of [[Binic]] southwards to [[Guérande]], leaving the towns of [[Loudéac]], [[Josselin]], and [[Malestroit]] in Upper Brittany. In 1886, [[Paul Sébillot]] noted that the boundary was deeper into what had been Breton territory, the line then running from [[Plouha]] on the north coast to [[Batz-sur-Mer]] in the south, on the [[Bay of Biscay]].

The boundary between 'Upper' and 'Lower' Brittany is now a purely imaginary line and has no administrative or other status. However, having been based on linguistic areas, the boundary does correspond very roughly to administrative borders. The town of [[Ploërmel]] is one point where the two meet.

In area, Upper Brittany now takes in something over half of the 35,000 square kilometres of the whole of Brittany, but it has some 2.5 million people, compared with Lower Brittany's 1.6 million. In the early 20th century, about 60% of the population had lived in the Breton-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Kelly-Holmes, Minority language broadcasting: Breton and Irish (2001), p.32 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5cI4wWJjTisC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[cultural heritage|cultural-heritage]] sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a [[natural disaster]], sorted by country.

Cultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types—tangible and [[intangible heritage]]. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites, as well as movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is meant by "cultural heritage"?|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|website=[[UNESCO]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316203151/http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|archivedate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stenning|first1=Stephen|title=Destroying cultural heritage: more than just material damage|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/destroying-cultural-heritage-more-just-material-damage|website=[[British Council]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145358/http://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/destroying-cultural-heritage-more-just-material-damage|archivedate=24 September 2015|date=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectable heritage is dealt with in [[art destruction]], whilst the destruction of movable [[industrial heritage]] remains almost totally ignored.

Deliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|that carried out by ISIL]], is regarded as a form of [[cultural genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Lizzie|title=Destruction of Middle East's heritage is 'cultural genocide'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middle-east/articles/Destruction-of-Middle-Easts-heritage-is-cultural-genocide/|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sehmer|first1=Alexander|title=Isis guilty of 'cultural cleansing' across Syria and Iraq, Unesco chief Irina Bokova says|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/unesco-chief-irina-bokova-accuses-islamist-groups-of-cultural-cleansing-isis-a6679761.html|accessdate=7 April 2016|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* During the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]], large-scale looting occurred in various archaeological sites including [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], ancient site of [[Ai-Khanoum]], the [[Buddhist]] monastery complex in Tepe Shortor which dates back to the 2nd century CE, and the National Kabul Museum. These sites were ransacked by various pillagers, including the pro-Russian government forces, destitute villagers, and the local crime rings.

Yet they were neither Persians nor Turks; they were Turkic-speaking Shiite subjects of Safavid dynasty of the Iranian Empire – in other words, the ancestors of people, whom we would now call “Azerbaijanis”.

* [[Azure Window]] , was a 28-metre-tall (92&amp;nbsp;ft) limestone natural arch on the island of Gozo in Malta. It was located in Dwejra Bay in the limits of San Lawrenz, close to the Inland Sea and the Fungus Rock. It was one of Malta's major tourist attractions. The arch, together with other natural features in the area of Dwejra, is featured in a number of international films and other media representations. The formation was anchored on the east end by the seaside cliff, arching over open water, to be anchored to a free standing pillar in the sea to the west of the cliff. It was created when two limestone sea caves collapsed. Following years of natural erosion causing parts of the arch to fall into the sea, the arch and free standing pillar collapsed completely during a storm on March 2017.

===World War II===
The resulting carnage and the aftermath of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]] (followed by the [[Manila massacre]]) is responsible for the near total obliteration and evisceration of irreplaceable cultural, and historical heritage &amp; treasures of the "Pearl of the Orient" (an international melting pot and a living monument of the meeting and confluence of Spanish, American and Asian cultures). Countless government buildings, universities and colleges, convents, monasteries and churches, and their accompanying treasures, all dating back to the 16th century and in a variety of style, were wiped out and ruined by both Japanese and inadvertently the American forces battling for the control of the city.

The most devastating damage happened at the ancient walled city of [[Intramuros]], as a result of the assault from 23–26 February, until its total liberation on 4 March, Intramuros was a shell of its former glory (except [[San Agustin Church (Manila)|the church of San Agustin]], the sole survivor of the carnage). Outside the walls, large areas of the city had been levelled.

After the Liberation, as part of rebuilding Manila, most of the buildings damaged during the war were either demolished in the name of "Progress", or rebuilt in a manner that bears no resemblance to the original; replacing European architectural styles during the Spanish and early American era with modern American- and imitation-style architecture. Only a few surviving old buildings remain intact, though even those that remain are continuously endangered to deterioration &amp; neglect, political mismanagement brought on by graft and corruption, rapid urbanization &amp; economic redevelopment, low public awareness &amp; ignorance.

===2013 Bohol earthquake===

Several historic buildings were damaged or destroyed during the [[2013 Bohol earthquake]], including the [[Loboc Church]], the [[Loon Church]], the [[Maribojoc Church]] and the [[Baclayon Church]].

* During February–March 1944, the Soviet conducted the [[Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush|expulsion of the Chechens and Ingush]] from the [[North Caucasus]] as a part of the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Soviet forced settlement program]] of the non-Russian ethnic minorities. The operation was resulted in the deportation of 496,000 [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] populations, and the death of around quarter of them. It was also accompanied by the destruction of local cultural and societal heritages; names of these nations were erased from the books and records; placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques were demolished; villages were razed; and the historical [[Nakh language]] manuscripts were almost completely destroyed.   
* Around 191,000 [[Crimean Tatars]] faced the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deportation by the Soviets]] in May 1944. This was accompanied by virtual "ethnic cleansing" from the [[Crimea]], with all the [[Tatar]] placenames being replaced with Russian ones, and the Muslim graveyards and religious objects were destroyed or converted into secular places.
* [[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow and [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Izhevsk)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in Izhevsk. Both of these were rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s.
* [[Russian cultural heritage register#Khrushchev's offensive (1959–1964)|In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign]].

'''Margaret Morganroth Gullette''' (born 1941), a Resident Scholar at the Women's Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, is a cultural critic who calls herself an age critic and theorist. She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of [[cultural studies]] of age include four books, the latest of which is ''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997); and ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel''  (1988).

== Early life and education==
Margaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

==Career==
Before becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited ''The Art and Craft of Teaching''. She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]

Working in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, ''The Daughters of Danaus'', and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called ''The Lost Bellybutton'' (1976). [citation needed]

She was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, ''Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe  (LIT Verlag).  She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS).  She was on the Advisory Committee of the ''Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts'', 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.

== Major ideas ==
Mike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her "one of America's foremost critics  of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of [[social constructionism]], and opponent of 'middle ageism'" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an "increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States.  Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as "the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17).  Gullette named the field of "age studies" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to "aging studies."

"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.

"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology" (Ball 2006, 214).  Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes "'the natural' out of context after context" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). "Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self." (Twigg, 2007)

:: "Cultural critics like Gullette (1997, 1999) and Featherstone and Hepworth (1991) have traced the ways in which culture imposes negative meanings on the bodies of older people, which are then read back as the source of those meanings. For Gullette, we are aged not by our bodies but by culture; and the response should be one of challenge and resistance, as the [sub]title of her [1997] book [''Declining to Decline''], ''Cultural Combat'', makes clear" (Twigg, 2007, 298).

"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between "progress narrative," automatically applied to children and younger people; and "decline narrative," automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.

Gullette's term "age autobiography" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of "aging."  "And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted" (Gullette 1993, 46). "The term itself ["the master narrative of aging"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . " (Kunow 2011, 26).  The "master narrative of decline" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while "the portmanteau self" is "an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity"  (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out "one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age":  "The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline" (Port 2012, n26).

Gullette has been called  "one of gerontology's few public intellectuals," who demonstrates "how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8).   "The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like "aging-past-youth," aging-into-the-middle years," and "aging-into-old age" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.

''Staging Age'', edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term "middle ageism" (Gullette 1998, 3–44)  to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to "Boomer-bashing" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as "age ideology," "being aged by culture," and the use of "progress narrative" as a way out of the binary between "positive aging" and "decline narrative"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.

Gullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including 
''A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging'' (2010), 
''Narratives of Life: Mediating Age'' (Munich 2009), 
''Opposing Viewpoints: The Aging Population'' (2009),  
''Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life. Readings'' (2008), 
''Coming of Age: First-Generation Critics Reflect on Age, Aging and the Making of Critical Gerontology'' (2008),  
''There is No Such Thing as a Natural Disaster'' (2006), 
''Our Bodies Ourselves: Menopause'' (2006);  
''Inequalities: Readings in Diversity and Social Life'' (2005),  
''Motherhood to Mothering: The Legacy of Adrienne Rich's Of Woman Born'' (2004), 
''Handbook on the Humanities and Aging'' (2000), 
''Figuring Age: Women, Bodies, Generations'' (1999), 
''Welcome to Middle Age! (And Other Cultural Fictions)'' (1998); 
''Aging and Gender in Literature: Studies in Creativity'' (1993).  
	
Working as a  freelance writer in parallel to her scholarly career, Gullette also publishes in mainstream, feminist, and progressive newspapers, magazines, and blogs.  These include  ''New York Times'' (Week in Review, Magazine, Arts), ''Nation'', ''Ms.'', ''Dissent'', ''Boston Globe'', ''Miami Herald'', ''Chicago Tribune''; ''American Prospect'', ''American Scholar''; and  www.womensenews; www.salon.com, www.theforward.com; www.nextavenue.com, www.ontheissuesmagazine.com  She has been interviewed on "Brian Lehrer," "The Callie Crossley Show," ''CultureShocks'', "The Connection," RadioNation, WBAI, "To the Best of Our Knowledge." 	

== Critical praise ==
"In breadth of vision, scholarly integrity, and the sheer exhilaration of her writing, Gullette's work is essential reading for all who wish to understand the origins of the transformation of midlife in our times and the possibility of real changes in attitudes to ageing--personal and social--under postmodern global capitalism" (Hepworth 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;143). "Gullette's gift for storytelling enthralls readers" (Achenbaum, 2011, 723). Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in ''Agewise'' was called "the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).

== Honors and awards ==
''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the ''Christian Science Monitor''. It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.

Gullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years''.

Her essay, "The Contagion of Euphoria," won the [[Daniel Singer Millennial Prize]] in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in ''Best American Essays'', have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including ''Kenyon Review'', ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', ''American Scholar'', and ''Yale Review''; and in scholarly journals like ''Feminist Studies'', ''Representations'', ''New Political Science'', ''Profession'', and the ''Journal of the History of Sexuality''.  Quotations from her books appear in ''The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years'' (2010).  She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman.  In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.

In 2012 Gullette won the Marigold "Ideas for Good" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives. She has been visiting Nicaragua since 1989, finding funding for adult education programs there.

They would write to [[serial killer]]s they were interested in, and then show off the artwork their [[pen pals]] had created once a year at a specialist show. In 1995, after a few years of exhibitions, the collection, and many other materials, were made into a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Canto | first = Minerva | title = Museum of Death moving to Hollywood | newspaper = The Associated Press State &amp; Local Wire | date = November 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1999, the couple attempted to acquire a large amount of materials from the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] cult suicides. Although they had been able to purchase many items prior to the main police auction, their interest in buying enough merchandise to recreate the scene in its entirety, led to enormous press interest and publicity. They were subsequently evicted by their landlord, and moved to Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="heads"/&gt;

Prior to the new Los Angeles building becoming a museum, the building was the home of [[Westbeach Recorders]], and prior to that, Producers Studio,&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://boulevardrecording.com/about/|title=About us|publisher=Boulevard Recording|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Pink Floyd]] and others recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Dark destinations: The Museum of Death | work=thecabinet.com | date=June 7, 2009 | url=http://www.thecabinet.com/darkdestinations/location.php?sub_id=dark_destinations&amp;letter=m&amp;location_id=the_museum_of_death}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls include deadening agents to help with recordings, which now serve to lend a quiet acoustic setting for the various exhibitions.&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt;

The museum displays a wide variety of art and artifacts surrounding the subject of death. Baby coffins are in one section, letters and artwork from various serial killers in another. There are films regarding [[autopsies]] as well as graphic photographs of crime victims. There is also a room filled exclusively with [[taxidermy]] of various types of animals. The museum's recreation of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] [[mass suicide]] includes the original beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Fox | first = Ben | title = Bidders snap up household items from site of worst mass suicide | newspaper = The Associated Press State &amp; Local Wire | date = November 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most notable item at the museum is the head of [[Henri Désiré Landru|Henri Landru]].&lt;ref name="roadside"/&gt; In 2014 the museum also acquired Thanatron, one of the original [[Euthanasia device|suicide machines]] built by [[Jack Kevorkian]].&lt;ref name="New Orleans"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Mythos''' is the term used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) for the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of an [[Tragedy#Performance_of_Greek_tragedies|Athenian tragedy]]. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.

== Variations on plot ==
“In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Poetics'' 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear.  According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in ''Poetics'' 13 and a different set in ''Poetics'' 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of ''Poetics'' as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”.  A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune.  The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”.  Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four.  Aristotle contends in ''Poetics'' 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to [[hamartia]], “error.”  Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’  ''Poetics'' 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, ''Poetics'' 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent.  “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of [[pathos]]:

1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.

2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.

3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.

4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.&lt;ref name="Rizzoli 11"&gt;Rizzoli 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's mythos vs. the modern interpretation of plot ==
Aristotle’s notion of mythos in ''Poetics'' differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s ''Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion'', Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore, Elizabeth. "Narratological Plots and Aristotle's Mythos." Arethusa 33 (2000): 37-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 40&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to [[Meir Sternberg]], Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg|Sternberg, Meir]]. "Universals of Narrative and Their Cognitivist Fortunes (II)." ''[[Poetics Today]]'' 24 (2003): 517-638.&lt;/ref&gt;). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events.  Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 64&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;1450.a:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.

[[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Mark W. "Introduction to Hegel's Theory of Tragedy." PhaenEx 1 (2006): 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 519&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 524&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as [[Vladimir Propp]], who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 45&lt;/ref&gt; Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 46&lt;/ref&gt; Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in ''Poetics'' because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13469">'''National psychology''' refers to the (real or alleged) distinctive psychological make-up of particular [[nations]], [[ethnic groups]] or peoples, and to the comparative study of those characteristics in [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]] and [[anthropology]].

The assumption of national psychology is that different [[ethnic]] groups, or the people living in a national territory, are characterized by a distinctive "mix" of human [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[values]], [[emotions]], [[motivation]] and [[Skill|abilities]] which is culturally reinforced by [[language]], the [[family]], [[schooling]], the [[State (polity)|state]] and the [[Media (communication)|media]].

==As a scientific discipline==

According to the German pioneer psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]], the attempt to theorize scientifically about national psychology dates from the mid-19th century [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wundt/Folk/intro.htm]. In post-1871 Germany, but especially during the [[Third Reich]], some German professors of linguistics and literature tried to influence [[English studies]] with a politically motivated "cultural science", which Ernst Leisi called the "Nationalpsychologische Methode."&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Leisi, ''Das heutige Englisch: Wesenszüge und Probleme'' (Heidelberg, 1955; rev. ed. 1985), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm presented a new view of contemporary and past English, on the basis of analogies drawn between specific linguistic traits, practices and constituents of the English (and German) national character. But in reality it amounted to little more than a repetition of preconceived notions of [[Alterity|otherness]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Utz, "Criticism and the Nation: The Nationalpsychologische Methode in German Anglistics, 1918-1955," in: ''Moeurs et images. Etudes d'imagologie européenne'', ed. Alain Montandon (Clermont-Ferrand: Centre de Recherches sur les Littératures Modernes et Contemporaines, 1997), pp. 121-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900, national psychology had become an accepted topic of study in the social sciences, at universities in Europe and North America.

==Use==

National psychology plays a role in politics via the [[ideology]] of [[nationalism]]. Politicians will appeal e.g. to "the French people", "the American people", the "Russian people", the idea being that members of a nation have a common [[national identity]], are part of a national community, and share common interests (the "national interest"). Politicians must try to unify and integrate people to work together for common goals, and appealing to their common national characteristics is often part of that.

Closely related is the idea of the [[national character]] which refers to the values, norms and customs which people of a nation typically hold, their typical emotional responses, and what they regard as [[virtue]] and [[vice]] - all factors which determine how they will habitually respond to situations.

Nationalism aims to unite people as members of a nation, and for that purpose, the [[belief]] that they really have common national characteristics is obviously useful, even if those common characteristics cannot be proved beyond a shared language and a similar physical appearance. Friendly rivalry between national sports teams is often used to symbolize national identity, or to express [[patriotism]]. For example, in South Africa sport is "the national religion. Transcending race, politics or language group, sport unites the country – and not just the male half of it."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southafrica.info "Sport in South Africa", retrieved 15 January 2013.[http://www.southafrica.info/about/sport/sportsa.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

National psychology has sometimes been used to explain why economic development occurred in a different way in different countries, or why a particular turn of political events happened as it did.

Reference is sometimes made to the "national [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]" or the "[[soul]]" of a nation, to explain why some public events can trigger a commotion or uproar in a country, or why a particular nation gets particularly enthusiastic or obsessed with a [[sport]] or cultural practice.

The idea is that a nation shares a specific cultural [[mentality]], [[morality]] or [[mindset]], embedded in its [[language]] and [[institutions]], which causes it to react much more strongly, or much less strongly, to particular situations than people of other nations would, and that people from different nations have different problem-solving strategies.

==Criticism of the concept==

However, the validity of the idea of a "national psychology" has been strongly criticized, for political, moral and scientific reasons.

Part of the problem is also that researchers usually interpret another culture from the point of view of the culture they are used to (regarded as "normal"). Even if many people in a country share a common psychological or biological characteristic, other people in that country may not share that characteristic at all. The important ways in which people differ may outweigh the common characteristics which they can all be proved to share.

Psychologists have found in research that when subjects are asked to identify the [[ethnicity]] or nationality of individuals by observing a line-up of different people, they cannot accurately recognize what their ethnicity or nationality is. [[Marketing]] and [[Mass media|Media]] experts have found that at most people can identify a representative [[stereotype]], [[archetype]] or [[caricature]] which ''symbolises'' a particular ethnic group, or characteristic ways of relating which a nation has.

Some additional complications are, that:

*the [[mentality]] of a nation may change over time, through shared experiences, and therefore that the characteristics which are thought to be "typical" of a nation may change over time. In modern society, often the young generation no longer identifies with the ways of the old generation, including their ideas of national identity and norms.
*large-scale [[international migration]] of peoples from different nations means that immigrants take on part of the habits and culture of the country to which they move, while also retaining part of their original culture. In this way, different national cultures are merged or mixed, and a new culture may be formed which has no clear "national" identification.  This, together with the growth of international [[tourism]], also means that people in one country increasingly adopt customs and habits from other countries, so that a ''nationally'' distinctive culture declines.
*When there are fights about identity, when people feel insecure about their identity, or when they try to get their identity accepted by others, a lot of people may claim they have important characteristics in common, or that they differ greatly from others, even although there is in truth little objective evidence for it. A fairly large "national movement" may appear of people sharing a national belief, even although in reality they do not have all that much in common. That is, people's desire to ''feel that they have something in common'', makes them act "as though" it already exists, even though this is not really true.

Because of all these difficulties in defining national psychology, often the most insightful portrayals of it are not really "scientific", but are found rather in the [[metaphors]] of fiction, for example in [[novels]] and [[films]]. These can gives insight into the "typical" emotional and intellectual world of a people, without pretending to apply to all its members.

==Globalization and postmodernity==

Some writers argue that in the era of [[globalisation]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy and Catherine J. Danks, ''Globalization and National Identities. Crisis or Opportunity?'' New York: Palgrave, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; national or ethnic differences can less and less explain why people behave as they do. Increasingly, it seems that many people do not identify with being part of a [[nation]], and just want to be recognized as a [[human being]] with [[human rights]]. They might cherish the place where they were born, without however being particularly [[patriotic]]. Other writers note that appeals to a national identity can be revived and used as a [[xenophobic]] response to perceptions that a country or region is being "taken over" by foreign corporations, or "overrun" by foreign immigrants.

Especially in [[Europe]] but also in many other parts of the world, adherence to a [[religion]] has strongly declined, and therefore the shared view of [[morality]] and [[human nature]] which religious authorities previously provided is no longer accepted. Religion has had a very strong influence on the shaping of national identity, and as this influence has declined, it can no longer define a national psychology as it used to. However, in other parts of the world, religions have increased their influence, and then national identity and religious identity may influence each other quite significantly.

In some strands of [[postmodernism]], nations are no longer viewed as legally enforced territories but as [[imagined communities]] in which national identification becomes increasingly vaguer. Thus, for example, [[Michel Foucault]] claimed that in [[Western world|the West]], "the project of the science of the subject has 
gravitated, in ever-narrowing circles, around the question of sex" (Foucault, ''The history of sexuality'', Vol. 1, Vintage, p.&amp;nbsp;70). This could be understood to mean that people really identify more with [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] than [[nationality]] nowadays.

Nevertheless, despite controversy, the concept of a "national psychology" still persists, insofar as people can observe practically e.g. through [[tourism]] and [[television]] that there are definitely differences in the way people live life, and how they think about it, in different countries, quite apart from differences in physical appearance or language. There are nowadays books on the national character of practically every people on earth.

==Modern studies==
Modern scientific studies of national psychology try to avoid the traps of prejudice and discrimination, mainly focusing fairly strictly on what can actually be measured, tested and proved objectively, but also by taking a positive (or at least neutral) view of national culture. The modern  emphasis is on whether systematic patterns of national differences can be genuinely ''proved'' to exist, what they are, and how they can be explained.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Inkeles, ''National character. A social-psychological perspective''. Transaction publishers, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; To an important extent, this approach is more successful than the old psychology, because much more attempt is made to verify hypotheses with comprehensive evidence, instead of making speculative guesses, or basing theories on anecdotal evidence. Yet researchers often cannot avoid altogether being drawn into disputes about national sentiments, sometimes making it difficult to stay neutral, detached and objective.

'''Nazareth College''' is a [[coeducational]], [[Private colleges|private]], religiously independent college in [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], a suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Founded by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors &lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/academics]&lt;/ref&gt;and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as "Naz" for short. 

==History==
[[File:Nazareth College.JPG|thumbnail|right|Golisano Academic Center, Nazareth College]]

===Founding===
At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [http://www.ssjrochester.org/ Sisters of St. Joseph] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/12190480324/ 402 Augustine Street].

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/news/2017/June/331/chris-baudo-named-women-s-hockey-coach-at-nazareth-college].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = New York Archdiocese Says Marist College 'No Longer Catholic'|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs.

In 2015, the York Wellness and Rehabilitation Institute opened after an extensive renovation/expansion of Carroll Hall consolidated and doubled the size of the clinics associated with the college's School of Health and Human Services and added collaboration space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9623">'''Persian studies''' is the study of the [[Persian language]] and its [[Persian literature|literature]] specifically. It is differentiated from [[Iranian studies]] which is a broader, more interdisciplinary subject that focuses more on the [[History of Iran|histories]] and [[Culture of Iran|cultures]] of all [[Iranian peoples]]. 

== History of Persian Studies in Iran ==
=== Before Islam ===

The study of language in Iran reaches back many centuries before [[Islam]]. The [[Avestan alphabet]], developed during the [[Sassanid Empire]], was derived from the Pahlavi alphabet and remained one of the most [[Phonology|phonologically]] sophisticated alphabets until the modern period. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] liturgies until that point had been orally transmitted, and the ability to set these ancient texts in writing helped to preserve them.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"&gt;Windfuhr, Gernot L. "Notes on Motivations in the Study of Persian." ''Persian Studies in North America: Studies in honor of Mohammad Ali Jazayery.'' Ed. Mehdi Marashi. (Bethesda: Iranbooks, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier than that, however, the invention of the [[Old Persian cuneiform script|Old Persian syllabary]], whose shapes were adapted from preexisting [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform systems]] demonstrates that Iranian peoples could think critically, logically, and imaginatively about their language. 

=== Early Islam ===

The coming of Islam announced the end of the world of [[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]] and the replacement of Zoroastrianism with Islam as the most important faith of the [[Iranian plateau]]. Iran became part of the great Islamic community, the [[Ummah]], and saw the rise of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the new language of [[Arabic literature|literature]] and learning. Iranian-born grammarians, rhetoricians, scientists, philosophers, theologians, contributed to the intellectual vitality of this new and vibrant civilization alongside other Muslims from other nationalities. Among the most prominent are:

* [[Sibawayh]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سیبویه ''Sībawayh'') (c. 760 CE) who wrote one of the first grammars of Arabic
* [[Avicenna]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أبو علي حسین إبن عبد الله إبن سینا ''Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Sīnā'') (c. 980 CE) one of the most celebrated and influential thinkers of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] contributed to astronomy, philosophy, logic, and mechanics, and helped to revive the Persian language by coining new words.
* [[Asadi Tusi]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أبو منسور علي أحمد اسدي طوسي ''Abū Mansūr ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad Asadī Ṭūsī'') (d. 1072 CE) whose dictionary represented an attempt to standardize the Persian language.

Many regions of this [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] saw the almost total replacement the indigenous language by Arabic: the pre-Islamic languages of [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], and [[North Africa]] exist only in isolated communities and have been largely replaced by Arabic. Not so in Iran, where the Persian language continued, albeit with an infusion of Arabic vocabulary, and thrived as the courtly language of the Islamic Orient. In fact it was in the Eastern reaches of the Caliphate, far from the seat of Arab power in Baghdad, where New Persian reemerged as a literary and courtly language.

== European study of Persian ==
=== Early Encounters ===

Persian was the ''lingua franca'' of a wide area, not limited to Iran.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The first Europeans to encounter the Persian language were the envoys and diplomats of early modern European nations sent first to Ottoman Turkey and then to other places. The earliest motivation for the study of Persian was to win converts to Christianity.

* [[Codex Cumanicus]], a glossary of Persian and Cuman Turkish words in Latin.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* a translation of the [[Pentateuch]] into Persian by the Jew Tavus&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* translations from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] of [[Francis Xavier| Francis Xavier's]] ''History of Christ'' and ''History of Peter'' (c. 1602 CE)

=== Study of the living language, 17th century ===

Grammars and dictionaries of the Persian language were first composed in the 17th century during which efforts were made to understand the "Persian of the people." Later on, Persian as it was actually used declined in importance as [[Persian literature#Classical Persian literature|Classical Persian literature]] was introduced to the continent.

* Raimondo of Cremona seems to have been the first to compose a grammatical sketch of Persian, but his manuscript remained unavailable.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* the Belgian priest de Dieu published ''Rudimentae Linguae Persicae'' (1639 CE) in which he established the basic [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Persian&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* Pater Angelus (Joseph Labrosse) studied Persian for fourteen years in the capital of [[Esfahan]] as part of the [[Vatican City|Vatican's]] Oriental Mission. He published a monumental work composed of "fourteen folios of mini-grammar and over 450 pages of words and phrases of the living language."&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}

=== Beginnings of Orientalism, 18th century ===

During this century, Europeans discovered the rich store of Classical Persian literature, and study of the Persian language meant study of the language as it was used in these works. The first edition of the [[Gulistan of Sa'di]] was published in 1654 CE.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|7}} As [[British East India Company|British trade]] with the [[Indian subcontinent]] increased, the focus of learning Persian shifted to the "colonial" Persian of India.&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|8}}

* [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil]] published the first edition of the texts of the Zoroastrian [[Parsis]] in his three-volume ''Zend-Avesta'' (1771 CE).
* William Jones's publication of his grammar (also in 1771 CE) marked when knowledge of Persian grammar became really accessible, since the prior works were not available to most people. He hoped the work would open up study of the Persian Classics, but it was intended to assist East India Company employees. William Jones founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1784 CE), the first [[Orientalism|Oriental]] society.

=== Orientalism, Rediscovery, 19th century ===

During this period of intense interest in the Orient, Persian proved to be one of the most important languages for the incipient field of [[Comparative Linguistics]]. Many scholars in prior centuries had commented on the similarities between Germanic and Iranian languages,&lt;ref name="Windfuhr"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} but in the 19th century, scholars for the first time postulated a common ancestor to languages like [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and European languages which has since come to be called the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. 

As important was the deciphering of [[Old Persian]], the language of dozens of inscriptions which still stand in Iran. [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]] first discovered that the language of these inscriptions was an ancient form of the Persian language. Since these inscriptions often included inscriptions in other Cuneiform scripts, this decipherment became like a [[Rosetta Stone]] for the languages of ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. All that we know of the languages and histories of the empires of [[Babylonia]], [[Assyria]], [[Sumer]], [[Elam]], and so on is indirectly indebted to knowledge of the Persian language.

=== Modernization, 20th century ===

During the [[Qajar dynasty]], Iranians first encountered Europeans in the context of the rise of the West. [[Napoleon I of France#Egyptian Expedition of 1798-99|Napoleon's expedition to Egypt]] in 1798 CE was the first European intrusion into the Muslim Middle East and prefigured many more disruptions for the peoples of this region, especially Iran. Iran lost territory in several wars with Russia and Britain. Iran's economy suffered greatly as European sea lanes bypassed the legendary [[Silk Road]] which had always been a pillar of Iran's economy. New [[Industrialization|industrial]] processes of production made traditional ways of living impossible for Iranians. As in many other countries during this time like [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], a [[Nationalism|nationalist]] reaction occurred in Iran as Iranians realized the importance of modernizing as quickly as possible to fight off the encroachment of the Western powers. It was at this point that modern educational institutions in Western tradition were first opened in Iran. Iran would never be the same, and the study of language there merged with the tradition in Europe.

A '''stateless society''' is a [[society]] that is not [[government|governed]] by a [[state (polity)|state]], or, especially in common [[American English]], has no government.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; In stateless societies, there is little [[centralization|concentration]] of [[authority]]; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in [[political power|power]] and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Stephen |title= The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2219-0 |page= 198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fLAWMGqKMb4C&amp;pg=PA198 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Béteille |first= André |authorlink= André Béteille |chapter= Inequality and Equality |editor-last= Ingold |editor-first= Tim |title= Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-415-28604-6 |pages= 1042–1043 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hKzSc02tbaMC&amp;pg=PA1042 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a [[sovereign state]]. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield [[failed state|little or no actual power]]. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been [[cultural assimilation|integrated into the state-based societies around them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Faulks |first= Keith |title= Political Sociology: A Critical Introduction |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2709-6 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_fjCczhvWj0C&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political philosophies, particularly [[anarchism]], consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.

==Prehistoric peoples==
In [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[history]], a stateless society denotes a less complex human [[community]] without a state, such as a [[tribe]], a [[clan]], a [[band society]] or a [[chiefdom]]. The main criterion of "complexity" used is the extent to which a [[division of labor]] has occurred such that many people are permanently ''specialized'' in particular forms of production or other activity, and depend on others for goods and services through trade or sophisticated reciprocal obligations governed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] and [[laws]]. An additional criterion is [[population size]]. The bigger the population, the more relationships have to be reckoned with.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Evidence of the earliest known city-states has been found in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] around 3700 BC, suggesting that the history of the state is less than 6,000 years old; thus, for most of human [[prehistory]] the state did not exist.

{{Quotation|For 99.8 percent of human history people lived exclusively in autonomous bands and villages. At the beginning of the Paleolithic [i.e. the stone age], the number of these autonomous political units must have been small, but by 1000 BC it had increased to some 600,000. Then supra-village aggregation began in earnest, and in barely three millennia the autonomous political units of the world dropped from 600,000 to 157.|Robert L. Carneiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert L. |last= Carneiro |chapter= Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion |page= 219 |editor1-first= Ronald |editor1-last= Cohen |editor2-first= Elman R. |editor2-last= Service |title= Origins of the State: The Anthropology of Political Evolution |location= Philadelphia |publisher= Institute for the Study of Human Issues |year= 1978 |lastauthoramp= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Generally speaking, the archaeological evidence suggests that the state emerged from stateless communities only when a fairly large population (at least tens of thousands of people) was more or less settled together in a particular territory, and practiced [[agriculture]]. Indeed, one of the typical functions of the state is the defense of territory. Nevertheless, there are exceptions: [[Lawrence Krader]] for example describes the case of the Tatar state, a political authority arising among confederations of clans of nomadic or semi-nomadic herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krader |title= Formation of the State |location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher= Prentice-Hallm |year= 1968 |at= ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristically the state functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, religious authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed by the rest of the working population. This assumes a sufficient level of labor-productivity [[per capita]] which at least makes possible a ''permanent'' [[surplus product]] (principally foodstuffs) appropriated by the state authority to sustain the activities of state functionaries. Such permanent surpluses were generally not produced on a significant scale in smaller tribal or clan societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Henri J.M. |editor1-last= Claessen |editor2-first= Peter |editor2-last= Skalnik |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henri+J.M.+Claessen#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20J.M.%20Claessen&amp;f=false |title= The Early State |location= The Hague |publisher= Mouton |year= 1978 |via= Google Books|isbn= 9789027979049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]] has argued that there is no evidence that the relatively sophisticated, urbanized [[Harappan civilization]], which flourished from about 2,500 to 1,900 BC in the [[Indus]] region, featured anything like a centralized state apparatus. No evidence has yet been excavated locally of palaces, temples, a ruling sovereign or royal graves, a centralized administrative bureaucracy keeping records, or a state religion—all of which are elsewhere usually associated with the existence of a state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Gregory L. |last= Possehl |chapter= Sociocultural Complexity Without the State: The Indus civilization |editor1-first= Gary M. |editor1-last= Feinman |editor2-first= Joyce |editor2-last= Marcus |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Archaic States |location= Santa Fe |publisher= School of American Research Press |year= 1998 |pages= 261–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the earliest large-scale human settlements of the [[stone age]] which have been discovered, such as [[Çatal Höyük]] and [[Jericho]], no evidence was found of the existence of a state authority. The Çatal Höyük settlement of a farming community (7,300 BC to circa 6,200 BC) spanned circa 13 hectares (32 acres) and probably had about 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Chris |editor-last= Scarre |title= The Human Past |edition= 2nd |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson |year= 2009 |page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern state-based societies regularly pushed out stateless indigenous populations as their settlements expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first=  John F. |title= The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-520-24678-2 |pages= 4–5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA4 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uncontacted peoples]] may be considered remnants of prehistoric stateless societies. To varying extents they may be unaware of and unaffected by the states that have nominal authority over their territory.

==As a political ideal==
Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.

A central tenet of [[anarchism]] is the advocacy of society without states.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year= 2005 |page= 14 |quote= Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheehan |first= Sean |title= Anarchism |location= London |publisher= Reaktion Books |year= 2004 |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of society sought for varies significantly between [[anarchist schools of thought]], ranging from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;{{cite book |last= Slevin |first= Carl |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics |editor1-first= Iain |editor1-last= McLean |editor2-first= Alistair |editor2-last= McMillan |lastauthoramp= yes |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marxism]], [[Marx's theory of the state]] considers that in a [[post-capitalist]] society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and [[Withering away of the state|wither away]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm |first= Frederick |last= Engels |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |year= 1880 |chapter= Part III: Historical Materialism |quote= State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not "abolished". It dies out...Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master—free. |via= Marx/Engels Internet Archive (marxists.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is that of [[stateless communism]], a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.

==Social and economic organization==
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] have found that [[social stratification]] is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gowdy |first= John |year= 2006 |chapter= Hunter-Gatherers and the Mythology of the Market |editor1-link= Richard Borshay Lee |editor1-first= Richard B. |editor1-last= Lee |editor2-first= Richard H. |editor2-last= Daly |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers |page= 391 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-60919-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economies of stateless agricultural societies tend to focus and organize [[subsistence agriculture]] at the community level, and tend to diversify their production rather than specializing in a particular crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chase |first1= Diane Z. |last2= Chase |first2= Arlen F. |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Mesoamerican Elites: An Archaeological Assessment |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-8061-3542-7 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kwxl5jjQ-dUC&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many stateless societies, conflicts between families or individuals are resolved by appealing to the community. Each of the sides of the dispute will voice their concerns, and the community, often voicing its will through village elders, will reach a judgment on the situation. Even when there is no legal or coercive authority to enforce these community decisions, people tend to adhere to them, due to a desire to be held in esteem by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleming, Thomas|title=The Politics of Human Nature|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-693-0|pages=165–166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saK1sFtSXuEC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tanning dependence''' is a syndrome where an individual appears to have a [[physical dependence|physical]] or [[psychological dependence|psychological]] dependence on [[sun tanning|sunbathing]] or the use of ultraviolet (UV) [[tanning bed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Warthan | first1 = M.

==Medical evidence==
Tanning dependence may have a physiological basis involving endogenous [[opioid]]s. There is evidence that [[Ultraviolet|UV]] exposure produces [[Beta-Endorphin|beta-endorphin]] in the epidermis and conflicting evidence of this opioid being released into the blood system, a pathway to the brain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heckman|first=CJ|year=2011|title=Indoor tanning: Tanning dependence and other health risks|url=|journal=Skin Care|volume=6|pages=20–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small study also found the opioid antagonist [[naltrexone]] reduced preference for UV tanning beds and at higher doses produced withdraw symptoms in frequent tanners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Better understanding of tanning dependence requires further controlled studies, especially in imaging and neurobiology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petit|first1=A|last2=Lejoyeux|first2=M|last3=Reynaud|first3=M|last4=Karila|first4=L|title=Excessive indoor tanning as a behavioral addiction: a literature review.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=2014|volume=20|issue=25|pages=4070–5|doi=10.2174/13816128113199990615|pmid=24001299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finding that excessive tanning can lead to dependence is based upon "the observations of many dermatologists." Dermatologists tell researchers that although they advise their patients not to visit tanning beds because of the risk of [[melanoma]], patients still do. In a 2014 literature review, researchers wrote that many people who tan excessively meet psychiatry's symptom criteria for substance abuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a case where ten studies provided data for the assessment of melanoma risk among subjects who reported “ever” being exposed compared with those “never” exposed; a positive association was found between exposure and risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Richard|last2=Spinelli|first2=John|date=2005|title=Tanning beds, sunlamps, and risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/3/562.short|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|volume=14|pages=562–566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of tanning dependence are/but not limited to: [[skin cancer]], [[Burn|skin burns]], premature skin aging, and eye damage (both short and long-term).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kravitz|first=Miriam|date=2010|title=Indoor tanning, skin cancer, and tanorexia: development of US indoor tanning policy|url=http://journals.lww.com/jdnaonline/Abstract/2010/05000/Indoor_Tanning,_Skin_Cancer,_and_Tanorexia_.2.aspx|journal=Journal of the Dermatology Nurses' Association|volume=2.3|pages=110–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term: ''Tanorexia'' ==

'''''Tanorexia''''' is the term used to describe a condition in which a person,  most notably Caucasian people, participates in excessive outdoor [[sun tanning]] or excessive use of other skin tanning methods (such as [[tanning bed]]s) to achieve a darker [[skin]] complexion because they perceive themselves as unacceptably pale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Young 'tanorexics' risking cancer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/real_story/3737025.stm|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome is different from tanning dependence, although both may fit into the same syndrome and can be considered a subset of tanning dependence.

Although the term ''tanorexia'' has been used by the media and several doctors to describe the syndrome, both the word and syndrome have not been widely accepted by the medical community, and is considered [[slang]] by many. The term tanorexia was coined after the medical condition [[anorexia nervosa]], a disorder characterized by low body weight and body image distortion with an obsessive fear of gaining weight. It can be likened to the common practice of adding the suffix "-aholic" (from the term [[alcoholic]]) to the end of any action or food someone enjoys extensively and often (e.g., "choc-aholic", "work-aholic", "golf-aholic", "shop-aholic", etc.).

Serious cases of tanorexia can be considered dangerous. This is because many of the more popular methods of tanning (such as those mentioned above) require prolonged exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation, which is known to be a cause of many negative side effects, including [[skin cancer]].

== Example cases ==
Extreme instances may be an indication of [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hunter-Yates J, Dufresne RG, Phillips KA |title=Tanning in body dysmorphic disorder |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=56 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=S107–9 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17434030 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.05.025 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190-9622(06)01497-6|pmc=1622896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mental disorder in which one is extremely critical of his or her physique or self-image to an obsessive and compulsive degree.  As it is with [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], a person with BDD is said to show signs of a characteristic called distorted body image. In layman's terms, anorexia sufferers commonly believe they are overweight, many times claiming they see themselves as "fat", when in reality, they are often, but not always, nutritionally underweight and physically much thinner than the average person.  In the same way, a sufferer of "tanorexia" may believe him or herself to have a much lighter – even a pale – complexion when he or she is actually quite dark-skinned.

Neither tanning dependence nor tanorexia are covered under the latest edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''.  However, a 2005 article in ''The Archives of Dermatology'' presents a case for UV light tanning dependence to be viewed as a type of substance abuse disorder.&lt;ref name="warthan2005"&gt;M. Warthan, T. Uchida, R. Wagner, Jr. UV Light Tanning as a Type of Substance-Related Disorder. Archives of Dermatology, August 2005; vol 141: pp 963-966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, New Jersey mother Patricia Krentcil received national media attention amid accusations that she had brought her five-year-old daughter with her to a tanning salon in order for the child to receive a tan. The child's school nurse had expressed concern over her sunburn, at which point the daughter claimed she had gone "tanning with Mommy". This prompted the school to call [[Division of Youth and Family Services]], as New Jersey law bans children under 14 from tanning booths.&lt;ref name="Tanning Mom"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grand jury says no indictment for mom in tan salon visit by daughter, 5|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/26/justice/new-jersey-tanning-case|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial media coverage of the event resulted in widespread attention given to Patricia Krentcil's unusually bronzed image, leading many to speculate that she was tanorexic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFo7XcMMZSk 'Tanning Mom' In Court, Denies Daughter, 5, Burned in Tan Salon: Does She Suffer from 'Tanorexia'?]&lt;/ref&gt; She was subsequently charged with second-degree child endangerment,&lt;ref name=Charge&gt;{{cite news|title=New Jersey tanning mom denies charges of child endangerment|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/05/02/11500434-new-jersey-tanning-mom-denies-charges-of-child-endangerment?lite|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was banned from over 60 tanning salons in the tri-state area.&lt;ref name=B&amp;!&gt;{{cite news|title='Tanning mom' Patricia Krentcil banned from over 60 tanning salons, report says|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57431758-504083/tanning-mom-patricia-krentcil-banned-from-over-60-tanning-salons-report-says/|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia claimed that it was all a misunderstanding, saying her daughter was never exposed to the tanning booth's UV rays and instead got slightly sunburned while playing outside on a warm day.&lt;ref name="Charge Denied"&gt;{{cite news|title=NJ Mom Arrested for Allegedly Taking Daughter, 5, into Tanning Booth|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NJ-Mother-Arrested-Daughter-Tanning-Booth-Girl-5-Burns-Body-Nutley-149738155.html|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later cleared of the charge.&lt;ref name=Cleared&gt;{{cite news|title='I'm still going to tan,' vows mom cleared in endangerment case|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-tanning-bed-mom-20130227,0,1747689.story|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, she was challenged to stop tanning for one month, which she did, greatly changing her appearance. She claimed it made her feel "weird and pale", and that she would cut back on tanning, but not eliminate it from her hobbies. A Connecticut-based business also attempted to seize and capitalize on the "tan mom" craze by creating an action figure doll of Patricia.&lt;ref name="Action Doll"&gt;{{cite news|title='Tanning mom' no longer tan|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/19189536/tanning-mom-no-longer-tan|accessdate=2013-03-01|date=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
Excessive tanning increases the risk of developing certain types of skin cancer. People that are addicted to tanning are dealing with a [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD).&lt;ref name="adaa.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/other-related-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd|title=Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|website=www.adaa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with tanorexia dislike the color of their skin but in reality the perceived defect may be only a slight imperfection or non-existent. Commonly, people who are suffering from tanorexia also suffer from anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and eating disorders.

To get the right treatment for tanorexia, people must mention specifically their concerns with their appearance when they talk to a doctor or mental health professional. Effective treatments that are available at the moment are [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], antidepressant medications, hypnosis and addiction treatment centers.&lt;ref name="adaa.org"/&gt; Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and can help relieve the obsessive and compulsive symptoms of tanorexia. The third treatment, is an audio hypnosis session which is developed by psychologists with a wide experience in helping people beat all kinds of addictive behaviour patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/addiction-help/tanning-addiction|title=Overcome tanorexia {{!}} Self Hypnosis Downloads|website=www.hypnosisdownloads.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, people with an extreme tanning addiction can look for help at specific addiction centres that are spread throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stopyouraddiction.com/other-addictions/tanning-addiction/|title=Tanning Addiction {{!}} Stop Your Addiction|work=Stop Your Addiction|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tanning culture in the Western Hemisphere==
In Western European culture, pale skin has indicated high status. A tan signified that you had to work outdoors as a manual laborer, while pale skin announced that you could afford to stay out of the sun and spend time and money cultivating your appearance.  In the 1920s, pioneering fashion designer [[Coco Chanel]] popularized the idea of tanning. She made it so the sun represented pleasure and relaxation as well as wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarnoff|first1=Deborah S.|title="The Tale of Tanning"|url=http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/tanning/tale-of-tanning|website=Skin Cancer Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Post Industrial Revolution, tanning gained popularity because at this time it was easier to be employed, and therefore there was less outdoor manual labor, and more indoor labor. Due to more indoor jobs, a tan began to mean that you had time the leisure time to bronze your skin and the money to travel to places where it could be acquired. A tan also represented enthusiasm for outdoor activities, as well as physical fitness and good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Yvonne, Erik Augustson, Lila Rutten, Richard Moser, Amy Yaroch.|title=History and Culture of Tanning in the United States|date=September 7, 2011|publisher=Springer Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tanning bed became implemented the concept of tanning changed yet again. The first self tanner, Tan-Man, was introduced in 1959, and [[UV]] tanning beds started to appear in the United States in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tavernise|first1=Sabrina|title="Warning: That Tan Could Be Hazardous"|journal=The New York Times|date=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted at [[Pepperdine University]] in 2005 found that 25 percent of beach-goers showed signs of tanning addiction or tanorexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Audrey|title="Tanorexia: The Real Orange Epidemic"|journal=Pepperdine Graphic|date=February 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the implementation of tanning beds in the United States, nearly 30 million people tan indoors every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britt|first1=Robert Roy|title="Tanorexia: The Insidious Lure of Tanning Beds"|url=http://www.livescience.com/3474-tanorexia-insidious-lure-tanning-beds.html|website=April 08, 2009|publisher=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been health issues related to tanning trends. In 2014 most Australian states put a ban on all commercial tanning beds. It is the second nation after Brazil to impose restrictions.  In 2011 over 2000 people died from skin cancer in Australia. Several European counties and American States have banned the use of tanning beds by minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/australia-bans-commercial-tanning-beds-article-1.2062217|title=Australia bans commercial tanning beds|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have also suspected that frequent exposure to UVs has the potential to become addictive. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain that a play a role in addiction are active when people are exposed to UV rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/how-tanning-changes-the-brain/?_r=0|title=How Tanning Changes the Brain|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|work=Well|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tanning culture in the Eastern Hemisphere ==
In the mid 1990’s, a new type of tanning trend appeared in Japan called Ganguro. It was a way for Japanese women to resist traditional roles for women in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japanesefashiontrends.wordpress.com/ganguro-yamanba-and-manba/|title=Ganguro, Yamanba, and Manba|date=2010-06-12|work=Japanese Fashion Trends|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is described as having deep tans and blond, orange, or silver gray hair. Many of these women were shunned by the public and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jpninfo.com/37610|title=From Ganguro to Gyaru: 4 Japanese Girl Styles {{!}} Japan Info|last=Info|first=Japan|website=jpninfo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25332">[[File:Technology Acceptance Model.png|250px|thumb|The Technology Acceptance Model, version 1. ({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]

The '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. The model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:
* '''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) – This was defined by Fred Davis as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]".
* '''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) – Davis defined this as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}).
The TAM has been continuously studied and expanded—the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} &amp; {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).

==History==

TAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989)
is the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology
(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747–768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&amp;mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).

Bagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:

:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})

Earlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms "task fit" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.

==Usage==
Several researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.

Segars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.

Mark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2×2 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).
The TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604–634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Venkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).

In an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.&lt;ref name=hf2010&gt;{{Cite journal

==Alternative models==
# The '''MPT model''': Independent of TAM, Scherer ({{harvnb|Scherer|1986}}) developed the [[matching person and technology model]] in 1986 as part of her National Science Foundation-funded dissertation research. The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), "Living in the State of Stuck", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.
# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.
# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments

==Criticisms==
TAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a "theory" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM "has diverted researchers' attention away from other 
important research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the 
independent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29–47|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).

Legris et al.&lt;ref&gt;Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.

Perceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).

A study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. &amp; Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''Transformative arts''' is the use of artistic activities, such as [[Storytelling|story-telling]], [[painting]], and [[Musical composition|music-making]], to precipitate constructive individual and social change.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Emotion|emotional]]. This results from the way participation in a [[Creativity|creative process]] and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held [[Belief|beliefs]], accompanied by unfamiliar [[Feeling|feelings]], which alters [[Social perception|perception]] of the world, oneself, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought [[Comfort|personal comfort]], [[Self-reflection|self-reflection]], and [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and [[behave]]. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual [[introspection]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015. Therapists Creating a Cultural Tapestry: Using the Creative Therapies Across Cultures. Charles C Thomas Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the social purpose of promoting [[Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion|inclusion]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[social justice|justice]].&lt;ref&gt;LeBaron, M. and Sarra, J. eds., 2018.

==History==

Soon after descriptions of ''concentration camp syndrome'' (also known as [[survivor syndrome]]) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that large numbers of children of [[Holocaust]] survivors were seeking treatment in clinics in [[Canada]]. The grandchildren of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to a child psychiatry clinic in comparison with their representation in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Fossion, P., Rejas, M., Servais, L., Pelc, I. &amp; Hirsch, S. (2003). "Family approach with grandchildren of Holocaust survivors," ''American Journal of Psychotherapy,'' 57(4), 519-527.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of children of traumatized parents being affected directly or indirectly by their parents’ post-traumatic symptoms has been described by some authors as ''secondary traumatisation'' (in reference to the ''second generation''). To include the ''third generation'', as well, the term intergenerational transmission of trauma was introduced.  Building upon the clinical observations by [[Selma Fraiberg]], child trauma researchers such as Byron Egeland, Inge Bretherton, and [[Daniel Schechter]] have empirically identified psychological mechanisms that favor intergenerational transmission, including dissociation in the context of attachment, and "communication"{{clarify|date=September 2017}} of prior traumatic experience as an effect of parental efforts to maintain self-regulation in the context of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and related alterations in social cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Fraiberg S, Adelson E, Shapiro V (1975).Ghosts in the nursery. A psychoanalytic approach to the problems of impaired infant-mother relationships. Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry,14(3), 387-421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egeland B, Susman-Stillman A (1996). Dissociation as a mediator of child abuse across generations. Child Abuse Negl.20(11):1123-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton I (1990). Communication patterns, internal working models, and the intergenerational transmission of attachment relationships. Infant Mental Health Journal, 11(3), 237-251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS (2003).  Intergenerational communication of maternal violent trauma:  Understanding the interplay of reflective functioning and posttraumatic psychopathology.  In S.W. Coates, J.L. Rosenthal and D.S. Schechter (eds.)  September 11:  Trauma and Human Bonds.  Hillside, NJ:  Analytic Press, Inc. pp. 115-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A., Robinson JL (2007). Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children’s mental representations of self and others.  Attachment &amp; Human Development, 9(3), 187-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both survivors and immediate witnesses of traumatic events in family history have traditionally been treated by family therapists. The first-generation experiences of combat veterans, hostages, prisoners of war, and the civil population who was victimized at the hands of [[war criminals]] from genocidal organizations such as the German [[Nazi Party]], Italian [[Mario Roatta|Fascist]] party, and similar organizations and their (para-)military arms, have been dealt with within the confines of political arena and international law, however the descendants of both immediate witnesses and victims of genocide, colonial suppression, slavery, political totalitarian control, clerical abuse in religious organizations, and many survivors of [[terrorism]] had to deal with the [[victimization sequelae symptoms|victimization symptoms]] themselves, without the transfer of original trauma being recognized and help offered.

Enslavement and slavery, civil and domestic violence, sexual abuse, and extreme poverty are also sources of trauma that can be transferred to subsequent generations. For instance, survivors of child sexual abuse may negatively influence future generations due to past untreated or unresolved trauma which can increase feelings of mistrust, isolation, and loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frazier|first=Kimberly|last2=West-Olatunji|first2=Cirecie|last3=St. Juste|first3=Shirley|last4=Goodman|first4=Rachael|date=2009|title=Transgenerational Trauma and Child Sexual Abuse: Reconceptualizing Cases Involving Young Survivors of CSA|url=https://pinnacle-secure.allenpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.17744%2Fmehc.31.1.u72580m253524811%3Fcode%3Damhc-site&amp;code=amhc-site|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|language=en-US|volume=31|issue=1|pages=22–33|doi=10.17744/mehc.31.1.u72580m253524811|issn=1040-2861|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodman and West-Olatunji proposed potential transgenerational trauma in the aftermath of natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Rachael|last2=West-Olatunji|first2=Cirecie|date=2008|title=Transgenerational Trauma and Resilience: Improving Mental Health Counseling for Survivors of Hurricane Katrina|url=https://pinnacle-secure.allenpress.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.17744%2Fmehc.30.2.q52260n242204r84%3Fcode%3Damhc-site&amp;code=amhc-site|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|language=en-US|volume=30|issue=2|pages=121–136|doi=10.17744/mehc.30.2.q52260n242204r84|issn=1040-2861|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, residents have seen a dramatic increase in interpersonal violence with higher mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-neworleans-katrina-crime/slow-recovery-goes-on-in-crime-weary-new-orleans-idUSN2827931220070829|title=Slow recovery goes on in crime-wear New Orleans|last=Franks|first=J.|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=9 August 2007|dead-url=|access-date=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon has been reported in the descendants of students at [[American Indian boarding schools]], who were removed from their parents and extended family and lacked models for parenting as a result. Being punished for speaking their native language and forbidden from practicing traditional rituals had a traumatic effect on many students, and child abuse was rampant in the schools as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ann M.

==Transmission==
Previous research assumed that the trauma transmission was mainly caused by the parents’ [[parenting|child-rearing]] behavior, however, it may have been also [[epigenetics|epigenetically]] transferred.&lt;ref name="Kellerman"&gt;Kellermann, N. (2013).[http://doctorsonly.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/08_Epigenetic-Transmission.pdf  Epigenetic Transmission of Holocaust Trauma], Isr. J. Psychiatry, Vol 50, No.1, pp 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt; An epigenetics study published in 2015 suggested that a parent’s experience of trauma may change a child’s stress hormone profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/descendants-of-holocaust-survivors-have-altered-stress-hormones/|title=Descendants of Holocaust Survivors Have Altered Stress Hormones|last=Rodriguez|first=Tori|date=March 1, 2015|work=Scientific American|access-date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many experts have since pointed out flaws in the study's methodology, which had a very small sample size, studied only a tiny number of genes, and didn't control for social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/ct-holocaust-trauma-not-inherited-20170609-story.html|title=Experts debunk study that found Holocaust trauma is inherited|last=Yasmin|first=Seema|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One blog, published by the Center for Epigenomics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, called this research the “over-interpreted epigenetics study of the week.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epgntxeinstein.tumblr.com/post/127416455028/over-interpreted-epigenetics-study-of-the-week|title=Over-interpreted epigenetics study of the week|website=EpgntxEinstein|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verisimilitude''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɛr|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɪ|l|ɪ|tj|uː|d}} is the "lifelikeness" or believability of a [[fiction|work of fiction]]. The word comes from {{lang-la|verum}} meaning truth and ''similis'' meaning similar.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary Online, Second Edition 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Language philosopher [[Stephen Neale|Steve Neale]] distinguishes between two types: '''cultural verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and '''generic verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own [[list of fictional genres|genre]] (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the [[fictional universe]] of a [[musical theatre|musical]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Stuart |title=Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices |location=London |publisher=Sage in association with the Open University |year=1997 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAqycFD4PBsC |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original roots==

Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of [[mimesis]], the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], it must have grounding in reality.

This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the [[Middle Ages]] particularly in Italian [[heroic poetry]]. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, [[decorum]]: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gordon |last=Teskey |chapter=Renaissance Theory and Criticism |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |edition=Second |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness [[Suspension of disbelief|to suspend his/her disbelief]], a phrase used originally by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert P. |last=Ashley |title=What Makes a Good Novel |journal=The English Journal |volume=60 |issue=5 |year=1971 |pages=596–598 |jstor=813069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.

==Continued evolution==

The idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. 

As more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist [[Pierre Nicolas Desmolets]]' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own [[internal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. E. |last=Sparshott |title=Truth in Fiction |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1967 |pages=3–7 |jstor=429239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ewlyn F. |last=Sterling |title=The Theory of Verisimilitude in the French Novel prior to 1830 |journal=The French Review |volume=40 |issue=5 |year=1967 |pages=613–619 |jstor=384665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern perspective==

During the rise of the [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.

The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mas'Ud |last=Zavarzadeh |title=The Semiotics of the Foreseen: Modes of Narrative in (Contemporary) Fiction |journal=Poetics Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=432–433 |jstor=1771956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zuckerkandl!''''' is a comic book published in 1968.  It was written by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] and animated by [[John Hubley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/zuckerkandl/oclc/2939 Zuckerkandl!] on WorldCat&lt;/ref&gt;  The book profiles the philosophy of the fictitious Austrian thinker Dr. Alexander Zuckerkandl and satirizes his philosophy of disentanglement. Resembling a fairy tale in form, ''Zuckerkandl!'' has been interpreted as a parody of [[Freud]].  As such, it blames Zuckerkandl and by extension Freud for the ills of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9506/June95Letters.html Letter in the University of Chicago magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;  The comic book also has [[Zuckerkandl (animation film)|an animated film version]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ007cIZ3Bc Zuckerkandl!] on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[John Hubley]].
