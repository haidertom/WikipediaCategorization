'''''Alltagsgeschichte''''' is a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s. It was founded by historians [[Alf Luedtke]] and [[:de:Hans Medick|Hans Medick]].

The name comes from German, where ''Alltag'' means "everyday life"; it can thus be roughly translated as "everyday history". In this sense, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can be considered part of the wider Marxian historical school of '[[People's history|history from below]]'. 

The purpose of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' is to find and prove the links between the down-to-earth, everyday, basic experiences of ordinary people in a society, and the broad social and political changes which occur in that society. Because this is such a massively broad endeavour to undertake, it can only feasibly be practised on the most minute of scales. Thus ''Alltagsgeschichte'' becomes a form of microhistory.

Its leading exponents include [[Paul Veyne]] and Michel Rouche in France, and Peter Carr in the United Kingdom. ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can also be linked to the Italian historical doctrine of ''Microstoria'' (microhistory).

[[File:Anacalypsis.jpg|thumb|The original edition of ''Anacalypsis'' by [[Godfrey Higgins]]]]

'''''Anacalypsis''''' (full title: '''''Anacalypsis: An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil of the Saitic Isis or an Inquiry into the Origin of Languages, Nations and Religions''''')  is a lengthy two-volume treatise written by religious historian [[Godfrey Higgins]], and published after his death in 1836. The book was published in two quarto volumes numbering 1,436 pages, and contains meticulous references to hundreds of references. Initially printed as a limited edition of 200 copies, it was partially reprinted in 1878, and completely reprinted in a limited edition of 350 copies in 1927. In 1965, University Books, Inc. published 500 sets for the United States and 500 sets for the British Commonwealth with Publisher's Note and a Postface.

==Meaning of the word "Anacalypsis"==
A problem that the reader may find in [[Godfrey Higgins|Higgins]]' book is that the meaning of the title is unexplained. In the original London edition of 1836, the word ''Anacalypsis'' appears only twice: once in the title, and once in a footnote on page 447, in which Higgins expresses his plan for a sequel titled ''Commentaries on the Anacalypsis and on Ancient History''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA447 ''Anacalypsis'']. Published by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman: London, 1836. Footnote on page 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''anacalypsis'' comes from the Greek ''ανακάλυψης'', which can be translated as «discovery» or «find». ''Anacalypsis'' is the antonym of "[[apocalypse]]." In the [[Godfrey Higgins|Higgins]]´ book, the meaning of the word is twofold:

* On the one hand, the idea of anacalypsis is seen as something that is evident, transparent and clear, while the apocalyptic is mysterious, dark, and enigmatic.
* On the other hand, ''apocalypse'' means ''revelation'' and refers to the last canonical book of the [[New Testament]], [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], which states that the world is heading for an imminent and tragic end.

Regarding to the second meaning, it is very important to understand that, the [[Godfrey Higgins|Higgins]]´ book, ''anacalypsis'' does not refer to a teleological principle, but a regression towards the beginning that allows us to see through light how myths were created, precisely like the [[apocalypse]] in many religions. In fact, the title of the work speaks precisely about this unveiling from the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]]. The idea of ''anacalypsis'' as "unveiling" was discussed in depth by the Russian-born writer and theosophist [[Helena Blavatsky]] in her book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]''.

==Content==
The work is the product of more than twenty years of research during which Higgins tried to uncover "a most ancient and universal religion from which all later creeds and doctrines sprang."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandaeanworld.com/mandaean_bibliography_book_11 mandaeanworld.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501212148/http://www.mandaeanworld.com/mandaean_bibliography_book_11 |date=2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes several [[map]]s and [[lithograph]]ic plates of [[Druid]]ical Monuments. The book itself details many of Higgins' beliefs and observations about the development of religion. Among these was his theory that a secret religious order, which he labeled "Pandeism" (from Pans- or Pandu- referring to a family of Gods, appending with -ism), had continued from ancient times to the present day, stretching at least from Greece to India, and possibly having once covered the entire world.

Among the many theories presented in this book is that both the [[Celt]]ic Druids and the [[Jew]]s originated in India – and that the name of the [[Biblical]] [[Abraham]] is really a variation of the word [[Brahma]], created by shifting the last letter to the beginning: Abrahma. Higgins used the term "Pandeism" to describe the religious society that he purported had existed from ancient times, and at one time had been known throughout the entire world. Higgins believed this practice continued in secret until the time of his writing, in the 1830s in an area stretching from [[Greece]] to India.

{{cquote|
I think Pandeism was a system; and that when I say the country or kingdom of Pandæa, I express myself in a manner similar to what I should do, if I said the Popish kingdom, or the kingdoms of Popery: or, again, the Greeks have many idle ceremonies in their church, meaning the Greeks of all nations: or, the countries of the Pope are superstitious, &amp;c. At the same time, I beg to be understood as not denying that there was such a kingdom as that of Pandæa, the daughter of Cristna, any more than I would deny that there was a kingdom of France ruled by the eldest son of the church, or the eldest son of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA439 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, section 2; page 439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His usage appears related to [[pantheism]], but is distinctly different. While pantheism normally refers to one universal god, the Pandeism described by Higgins, refers to the worship of a family, a union, or a [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of gods which are collectively universal.

Higgins was a follower of [[John Toland]]; although Toland had lived in an era when "deism" and "theism" were interchangeable, Higgins wrote during the 1820s and 1830s, a period several generations later when [[deism]] was popular and  became distinct from [[theism]]. When coining "Pandeism", Higgins showed his awareness of the similarity between Pandeism and [[pantheism]] by directly contrasting his Pandeism with Toland's pantheism:
{{cquote|
Many persons have thought that this ''Pan'' related to what has been called Pantheism, or the adoration of universal nature, and that Pantheism was the first system of man. For this opinion I cannot see a shadow of foundation. As I have formerly said, it seems to me contrary to common sense to believe, that the ignorant half-savage would first worship the ground he treads upon,— that he would raise his mind to so abstruse and so improbable a doctrine as, that the earth he treads upon created him and created itself: for Pantheism instantly comes to this.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA440 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, section 2; page 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Higgins was also aware of the similarity between his Pandeism and deism, and demonstrated familiarity with deism, as he mentions deism or deists at several other points in the same work. Higgins noted for example that "the [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Rev. R. Taylor, A.M.]], the Deist, now in gaol, persecuted by the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] for his religious opinions, in his learned defense of Deism called the ''[[Diegesis]]'', has clearly proved all the hierarchical institutions of the Christians to be a close copy of those of the [[Essenes|Essenians]] of [[Egypt]]." &lt;ref&gt;''Anacalypsis'', pg. 787.&lt;/ref&gt;

While more contemporary [[pandeism]] evokes both pantheism and deism and suggests their combination, Higgins' usage is removed from both. Whereas Toland's construction of pantheism was based on the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] root words ''pan'', meaning ''all'' and ''Theos'', meaning ''God'', Higgins flips the construction around, stating:
{{cquote|
When I consider all the circumstances detailed above respecting the Pans, I cannot help believing that, under a mythos, a doctrine or history of a sect is concealed. [[Kunti|Cunti]], the wife of [[Pandu]] (du or God, Pan), wife of the generative power, mother of the [[Pandavas]] or devas, daughter of Sura or Syra the Sun — Pandæa only daughter of Cristna or the Sun — Pandion,&lt;ref&gt;The person Higgins refers to as "Pandion" here is more commonly known as [[Aegeas]], the husband of Medea and father of Medus; Aegeas was himself the son of [[Pandion II]], and Higgins' reference clearly equated Aegeas with the [[Kinship and descent|lineage]] of his father; use of the less common name, Pandion, connects this figure to Pandu and others with Pand- names.&lt;/ref&gt; who had by [[Medea]] a son called [[Medus]], the king of the Medes, who had a cousin, the famous [[Perseus]] — surely all this is very [[mythological]] — an historical parable!

...

We have seen that though Cristna was said to have left many sons, he left his immense empire, which extended from the sources of the [[Indus River|Indus]] to [[Cape Comorin]], (for we find a Regio Pandionis near this point,) to his daughter Pandæa; but, from finding the icon of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] so constantly shaded with the nine Cobras, &amp;c., I am induced to think that this Pandeism was a doctrine, which had been received both by [[Buddhists]] and [[Brahmin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA439 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, sections 1 and 2; page 439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to Toland, Higgins uses the word "Pans" or "Pande" to collect variations of named gods or godlike heroes – such as [[Pandu]], Pandæa, the [[Pandava]]s, and Pandion – into a single system of worship called "Pandeism" as a sort of family name for a group of godlike individuals. Thus where Toland's term referred to pan- (all) and -theism (god), Higgins refers to Pande- (a root indicating this family of gods) and [[-ism]], a wholly English construction indicating allegiance to an ideology. The term related by Higgins refers to a secret sect of worshipers of these "Pans", which was left in the wake of the collapse of an ancient empire that stretched from [[Greece]] (the home of [[Medea]] and [[Perseus]]) to India (where the [[Buddhists]] and the [[Brahmins]] coexist). Higgins concludes that his observations:

{{cquote|
...confirm the very close connexion which there must have been in some former time, between [[Siam]], [[Afghanistan]], Western [[Syria]], and Ireland. Indeed I cannot doubt that there has been really one grand empire, or one Universal, one Pandæan, or one Catholic religion, with one language, which has extended over the whole of the old world; uniting or governing at the same time [[Colombo|Columbo]] in the island of Serendive, and [[Iona|Columbo]] in the West of Scotland...&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Higgins]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sNBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA443 ''Anacalypsis''] (1836). Book 8, chapter 8, sections 3; page 443.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While worthy of note, the above discussion is an example of what Higgins tries to present in his work: that religious scripture is written in a manner to confuse rather than clarify.  The exhaustive discussion above comparing "Pandeism" and "Pantheism", while valid, fails to disclose the main emphasis of his effort, which is to show that all religions are the same and from a lost, antediluvian, original source in which all characters are allegoric representations of the zodiac with the primary deity being the sun.  His theory is that this lost doctrine has been corrupted, by ignorance of allegory or by intentional purposes, from ancient times up and through Higgins' own time.

==Death and later influence==
Higgins died before he was able to complete the final chapter on [[Christianity]]. Higgins leaves clues, however, that there may be additional layers of meaning in his work, stating in the preface to Vol. I of 'Anacalypsis':

:I think it right to warn my reader, that there are more passages than one in the book, which are of that nature, which will be perfectly understood by my [[Masonic]] friends, but which my engagements prevent me explaining to the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;''Anacalypsis'', xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, [[John Ballou Newbrough]] cited extensively to the ''Anacalypsis'', including Higgins' use of Pandeism, in the notes to Newbrough's 1882 ''[[Oahspe]] Bible''.&lt;ref&gt;John Ballou Newbrough, ''Oahspe Bible'', pg. 874.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, possibly related coinings of Pandeism have occurred elsewhere. One author writes of a contemporary religious group in Bali (which is within the geographic realm of Pandeism described by Higgins):

:The empu uses a typical pedanda ketu, "crown" which is tall and red, and a ball. Another man leads Pande ceremonies on the island. He represents a curious mix of Buddhism, Hinduism, and, if it can be called this, "Pandeism".&lt;ref&gt;Fred B.

The '''Bar massacre''' ({{lang-sq|Masakra e Tivarit}}) was the killing of an unclear number of mostly [[Albanians|ethnic Albanian]] recruits from [[Kosovo]] by [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in late March or early April 1945 in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], a municipality in Montenegro , at the end of [[World War II]].

== Massacre ==
By 1942, the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] became a home of many Serbians and other refugees who were forced to flee from Kosovo and to escape the violence done by Albanian units. Many of these joined the Partisan forces and participated in their activities at Bar.&lt;ref name="ZM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/dokumenti/pristan5_grupa_autora.htm |title= Željko Milović-DRUGI SVJETSKI RAT|publisher=Montenengrina Digitalna Biblioteka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victims were [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanian recruits from Kosovo]], who had been pressed by the Yugoslav Partisans into service. These men were then assembled in Prizren and marched on foot in three columns to Bar where they were supposed to receive short training and then sent off to the front.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; The march took the rugged mountain ranges of Kosovo and Montenegro to reach its destination. Upon arrival locals reported that these men, who had marched a considerable distance, were "exhausted" and "distressed". The column of men which stretched a few kilometres were then gathered on the Barkso Polje. At one point, in Polje, one of the Albanians from the column attacked and killed one of the Yugoslav officers, Boža Dabanovića.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; Very soon after that somebody from the column threw a smuggled bomb at the commander of the brigade.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; This created a panic among the Partisans. The guards watching over the recruits then fired into the crowd killing many and prompting the survivors to flee into the surrounding mountains.&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; In another case, several hundred Albanians were herded into a tunnel, near Bar, which was subsequently sealed off so that all of those trapped within the tunnel were [[Asphyxia|asphyxiated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Vickers|title=The Albanians: A Modern History|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vtQABAAAQBAJ&amp;q=tivar#v=snippet&amp;q=tivar&amp;f=false|publisher=I.B.Tauris}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yugoslav sources put the number of victims at 400&lt;ref name="ZM" /&gt; while Albanian sources put the figure at 2,000 killed in Bar alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/ata/1996/96-09-19.ata.html#03 |title=Massive Grave of Albanian Victims of Tivari Massacre uncovered |date=19 September 1996|publisher=Albanian Telegraphic Agency |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Croatian historian [[Ljubica Štefan]], the Partisans killed 1,600 Albanians in Bar on 1 April after an incident at a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ljubica Štefan|title=Mitovi i zatajena povijest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPqfAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=K.

'''Carroll Quigley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|g|l|i}}; November 9, 1910&amp;nbsp;– January 3, 1977) was an American [[historian]] and theorist of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution of civilizations]].  He is noted for his teaching work as a professor at [[Georgetown University]], for his academic publications, and for his research on the [[Round Table movement]].&lt;ref name="Obituary1977"&gt;{{cite news

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Boston]], Quigley attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied history and earned B.A, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. He taught at [[Princeton University]], and then at Harvard, and then from 1941 to 1976 at the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;

From 1941 until 1972, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilizations.  According to his obituary in ''[[The Washington Star]]'', many alumni of Georgetown's [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] asserted that this was "the most influential course in their undergraduate careers".&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;

In addition to his academic work, Quigley served as a consultant to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;  He was also a book reviewer for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and a contributor and editorial board member of ''[[Current History]]''.&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|94}}

Quigley retired from Georgetown in June 1976 and died the following year.&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;

===Major conclusions===
====Inclusive diversity====
Quigley's work emphasized inclusive diversity as a core value of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]],&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-1227/34"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|pages= 1227–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting it with the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-84"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|page= 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded the book ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]'' with the hope that the West could "resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity".&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-1311"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|page= 1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his study of history, "it is clear that the West believes in diversity rather than in uniformity, in pluralism rather than in monism or dualism, in inclusion rather than exclusion, in liberty rather than in authority, in truth rather than in power, in conversion rather than in annihilation, in the individual rather than in the organization, in reconciliation rather than in triumph, in heterogeneity rather than in homogeneity, in relativisms rather than in absolutes, and in approximations rather than in final answers."&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-1227"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|page= 1227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quigley asserts that any intolerance or rigidity in the religious practices of the West are aberrations from its nature of inclusivity and diversity. Quigley points to the tolerance and flexibility in [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]'s belief that theological truth is revealed over time through dialogue within the Christian community, which allows the community to adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref name="Aquinas2006"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas Aquinas|title= Summa Theologiae: Volume 1, Christian Theology: 1a. 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C5SJBda4buUC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate= 20 May 2013|date= 26 October 2006|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-02909-4|pages= 102–}}, quoted on p1230 of Tragedy and Hope&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry J Hogan, p18 of the foreword to {{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= The evolution of civilizations: an introduction to historical analysis|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uyImAQAAMAAJ|accessdate= 26 May 2013|year= 1979|publisher= Liberty Press|isbn= 978-0-913966-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Institutionalization and the fall of civilizations====
Having studied the rise and fall of civilizations, "Quigley found the explanation of disintegration in the gradual transformation of social 'instruments' into '[[institution]]s,' that is, transformation of social arrangements functioning to meet real social needs into social institutions serving their own purposes regardless of real social needs".&lt;ref&gt;Harry J Hogan in the foreword (p17) and Quigley in the conclusion (p416) to {{cite book|author=Carroll Quigley|title= The evolution of civilizations: an introduction to historical analysis|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uyImAQAAMAAJ|accessdate= 26 May 2013|year= 1979|publisher= Liberty Press|isbn= 978-0-913966-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weapons and democracy====
From a historical study of weapons and political dynamics, Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, written by historian [http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml Harry J Hogan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901040610/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml |date=2013-09-01 }} in 1982, to Quigley's ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Chester G Starr, Review of ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability'', American Historical Review, Feb 1984, p98, available at [http://www.carrollquigley.net/book-reviews/Review-of-Weapons-Systems-Political-Stability-Starr.htm carrollquigley.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to buy and use.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-38"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|pages= 38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why democracy occurs so rarely in human history.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-307"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|page= 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s (peaking in the 1880s), guns were the best weapon available. In America, almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments couldn't do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-38"/&gt; (Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and of democracy&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-307"/&gt;).

In the 1900s, expensive, specialist weapons (such as tanks and bombers) became available, and citizen soldiers became dominated by specialist soldiers.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-58"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|page= 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quigley notes that the slaughter of [[World War I]] (1914-1918) was due to the mismatch between the traditional armies (citizen soldiers) and the available weapons ([[machine gun]]s used defensively).&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-53"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
Quigley's writing style is dense, influenced by a former history professor of his:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As we raced along, Goethe was covered in fifteen minutes, Schiller in ten, Fichte in five...he covered any topic simply by slicing it up into a small number of parts and giving a name to each part. The complex character and achievement of Goethe, for example, were divided into six portions, each was given a title, and, ever after, the whole of Goethe could be evoked merely by reciting six words...I should like to outdare even my former professor by dividing this greater complexity &lt;nowiki&gt;[Classical culture]&lt;/nowiki&gt; into only five parts."&lt;ref&gt;Evolution of Civilizations, pp278-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quigley's analytical style is scientific, stemming from his earlier training in physics.&lt;ref&gt;foreword (by Harry J Hogan) to ''Evolution of Civilizations'', pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Evolution of Civilizations'', chapter 1: Scientific Method and the Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this book we are concerned with the social sciences...and particularly with the effort to apply a scientific method of observation, formulation of hypotheses, and testing to such phenomena. The enormous size of this field has made it advisable to curtail our attention to the process of social change, especially in civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;
''Evolution of Civilizations'', p.47
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence on Bill Clinton==
In his freshman year in the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], future [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] took Quigley's course, receiving a 'B' as his final grade in both semesters (an excellent grade in a course where nearly half the students received D or lower).&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|94, 96}}

In 1991, Clinton named Quigley as an important influence on his aspirations and political philosophy, when Clinton launched his presidential campaign in a speech at Georgetown.&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|96}}  He mentioned Quigley again during his acceptance speech to the [[1992 Democratic National Convention]], as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a teenager, I heard John Kennedy's summons to citizenship. And then, as a student at Georgetown, I heard that call clarified by a professor named Carroll Quigley, who said to us that America was the greatest Nation in history because our people had always believed in two things&amp;ndash;that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Bill Clinton|Clinton, Bill]]|title=Acceptance Speech|work= Democratic National Convention|location= New York, NY|date= July 16, 1992|url=http://www.4president.org/speeches/billclinton1992acceptance.htm|edition= Full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Quigley and the Round Table group ==
One distinctive feature of Quigley's [[History|historical writings]] is his assertion that the [[Round Table movement]] have played a significant role in recent world history.  His writing on this topic has made Quigley famous among many who investigate [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|96, 98}}

=== Quigley's claims about the Milner Group ===
In his book ''The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden'' (written in 1949 and published posthumously in 1981),&lt;ref name="Quigley1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carroll Quigley|title=The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V19nAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2013|publisher=Books in Focus, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-916728-50-2|year=1981}}, written in 1949 and published posthumously in 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Quigley purports to trace the history of a secret society (Round Table group) founded in 1891 by [[Cecil Rhodes]] and [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]]. Quigley notes that "The organization was so modified and so expanded by Milner after the eclipse of Stead in 1899, and especially after the death of Rhodes in 1902, that it took on quite a different organization and character, although it continued to pursue the same goals."&lt;ref&gt;''The Anglo-American Establishment'', ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The society consisted of an inner circle ("The Society of the Elect") and an outer circle ("The Association of Helpers", also known as The Milner Kindergarten and the [[Round Table movement|Round Table Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://carrollquigley.net |title=The Anglo-American Establishment, ch.1 |page=5 }}]&lt;/ref&gt;  The society as a whole does not have a fixed name:

&lt;blockquote&gt; This society has been known at various times as [[Milner's Kindergarten]], as [[Round Table movement|the Round Table Group]], as the Rhodes crowd, as ''[[The Times]]'' crowd, as the [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] group, and as [[Cliveden set|the Cliveden set]]. ...  I have chosen to call it [[Milner group|the Milner group]]. Those persons who have used the other terms, or heard them used, have not generally been aware that all these various terms referred to the same Group...this Group is, as I shall show, one of the most important historical facts of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="QuigleyAAE"&gt;{{cite book
| author = Carroll Quigley
| title = The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden

| series = 
| year = 1981
| doi =

Quigley assigns this group primary or exclusive credit for several historical events:  the [[Jameson Raid]], the [[Second Boer War]], the founding of the [[Union of South Africa]], the replacement of the [[British Empire]] with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and a number of Britain's foreign policy decisions in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="QuigleyAAE" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

In 1966, Quigley published a one-volume history of the twentieth century, titled ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]''.  At several points in this book, the history of the Milner group is discussed.  Moreover, Quigley states that he has recently been in direct contact with this organization, whose nature he contrasts to right-wing claims of a communist conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This [[Radical right (United States)|radical Right]] fairy tale, which is now an accepted folk myth in many groups in America, pictured the recent history of the [[United States]], in regard to domestic reform and in foreign affairs, as a well-organized plot by extreme [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] elements&amp;nbsp;... This myth, like all fables, does in fact have a modicum of truth.  There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international [[Anglophile]] network which operates, to some extent, in the way the Radical right believes the [[Communist party|Communists]] act.  In fact, this network, which we may identify as the [[Round Table movement|Round Table Groups]], has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other group, and frequently does so.  I know of the operation of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments.  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in [[history]] is significant enough to be known.&lt;ref name="QuigleyTAH"&gt;{{cite book

According to Quigley, the leaders of this group were [[Cecil Rhodes]] and [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]] from 1891 until Rhodes' death in 1902, Milner alone until his own death in 1925, [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]] from 1925 to 1955, [[Robert Brand, 1st Baron Brand|Robert H. (Baron) Brand]] from 1955 to 1963, and [[Adam D. Marris]] from 1963 until the time Quigley wrote his book.  This organization also functioned through certain loosely affiliated "front groups", including the [[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]], the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref name="QuigleyTAH" /&gt;{{rp|132, 950–952}}

In addition, other secret societies are briefly discussed in ''Tragedy and Hope'', including a consortium of the leaders of the [[central bank]]s of several countries, who formed the [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref name="QuigleyTAH" /&gt;{{rp|323–324}}

=== Citations of Quigley in exposés of purported conspiracies ===
Soon after its publication, ''Tragedy and Hope'' caught the attention of authors interested in conspiracies.  They proceeded to publicize Quigley's claims, disseminating them to a much larger audience than his original readership.&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|96, 98}}

This began in 1970, when [[W. Cleon Skousen]] published ''The Naked Capitalist: A Review and Commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley's Book "Tragedy and Hope"''.  The first third of this book consists of extensive excerpts from ''Tragedy and Hope'', interspersed with commentary by Skousen.  Skousen quotes Quigley's description of the activities of several groups&amp;nbsp;— the Milner Group, a [[cartel]] of [[International finance|international bankers]], the [[Communist party|Communist Party]], the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].  According to Skousen's interpretation of Quigley's book, each of these is a facet of one large conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1971, [[Gary Allen]], a spokesman for the [[John Birch Society]], published ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'', which became a [[bestseller]].  Allen cited Quigley's ''Tragedy and Hope'' as an authoritative source on conspiracies throughout his book.  Like Skousen, Allen understood the various conspiracies in Quigley's book to be branches of one large conspiracy, and also connected them to the [[Bilderberg Group|Bilderbergers]] and to [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Quigley is also cited by several other authors who assert the existence of powerful conspiracies.  [[Jim Marrs]], whose work was used as a source by [[Oliver Stone]] in his film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', cites Quigley in his book ''Rule By Secrecy'', which describes a conspiracy linking the Milner Group, [[Skull and Bones]], the [[Trilateral Commission]], the [[Illuminati|Bavarian Illuminati]], the [[Knights Templar]], and [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] who posed as the [[Anunnaki|Sumerian gods]] thousands of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Quigley was dismissive of the authors who used his writings to support theories of a world domination conspiracy. Of W. Cleon Skousen's ''The Naked Capitalist'' he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Skousen's book is full of misrepresentations and factual errors. He claims that I have written of a conspiracy of the super-rich who are pro-Communist and wish to take over the world and that I'm a member of this group. But I never called it a conspiracy and don't regard it as such. I'm not an "insider" of these rich persons, although Skousen thinks so. I happen to know some of them and liked them, although I disagreed with some of the things they did before 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Gary Allen's ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'' he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They thought Dr. Carroll Quigley proved everything. For example, they constantly misquote me to this effect: that Lord Milner (the dominant trustee of the Cecil Rhodes Trust and a heavy in the Round Table Group) helped finance the Bolsheviks. I have been through the greater part of Milner's private papers and have found no evidence to support that.

Further, ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'' insists that international bankers were a single bloc, were all powerful and remain so today. I, on the contrary, stated in my book that they were much divided, often fought among themselves, had great influence but not control of political life and were sharply reduced in power about 1931-1940, when they became less influential than monopolized industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Criticism ===
In ''Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler'', the Hoover institution scholar [[Antony C. Sutton]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Quigley goes a long way to provide evidence for the ''existence'' of the power elite, but does not penetrate the ''operations'' of the elite. Possibly, the papers used by Quigley had been vetted, and did not include documentation on elitist manipulation of such events as the Bolshevik Revolution, Hitler's accession to power, and the election of Roosevelt in 1933. More likely, these political manipulations may not be recorded at all in the files of the power groups. They may have been unrecorded actions by a small ad hoc segment of the elite. It is noteworthy that the documents used by this author came from government sources, recording the day-to-day actions of Trotsky, Lenin, Roosevelt, Hitler, J.P. Morgan and the various firms and banks involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[F. William Engdahl]], in an overview of financial imperialism entitled ''The Gods of Money'', criticized Quigley for stating that the power of international bankers declined in the 1930s, and insofar as the influence of international bankers in America was concerned, suggested that Quigley was confusing "international finance" with Morgan interests. He suggested, like Sutton, that Quigley's papers had been vetted. Engdahl argued that it was not the case that the power of "international finance" declined, but rather, Morgan interests fell and were replaced by Rockefeller interests.&lt;ref&gt;Engdahl, F. William. ''The Gods of Money: Wall Street and the Death of the American Century''. Wiesbaden, Germany: Edition.engdahl, 2009. pp. 81-135&lt;/ref&gt;

Quigley stated that the intentions and objectives of the group he profiled, associated with [[Wall Street]] and the [[City of London]] and [[Cecil Rhodes]]' super-imperialism, were "largely commendable". Members of the group, in statements recorded by the ''New York Times'' in 1902, proclaimed that they formed their society for the purpose of "gradually absorbing the wealth of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/04/09/101945773.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=MR.

He Believed a Wealthy Secret Society Should Work to Secure the World's Peace and a British-American Federation | date=April 9, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quigley argued that the Round Table groups were not World Government advocates but super-imperialists. He stated that they emphatically did not want the League of Nations to become a World Government. Yet [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]], who, according to Quigley, was one of the leaders of the Round Table movement, wished for it to be a World government with teeth, writing articles with [[H. G. Wells|H.&amp;nbsp;G. Wells]] urging this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/19jan/leag119.htm|magazine=The Atlantic|title=The Idea of a League of Nations|date=January 1919|first=Herbert George|last=Wells|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Identity''' (also known as '''Identity Christianity''')&lt;ref name="Doctrine"/&gt; is a [[racist]], [[anti-Semitic]], and [[white supremacist]] interpretation of [[Christianity]] which holds that only [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Celtic people|Celtic]], [[Nordic race|Nordic]], [[Aryan race|Aryan]] people and those of kindred blood are the descendants of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] and hence the descendants of the ancient [[Israelites]] (primarily as a result of the [[Assyrian captivity]]).&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Christian Identity |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/christian-identity |website=www.splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Identity is not an [[organized religion]], and is not connected with specific [[Christian denomination]]s; instead, it is independently practiced by individuals, [[local church|independent congregations]] and some [[prison gang]]s.&lt;ref name="BehindBars"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|title= Bigotry Behind Bars: Racist Groups In U.S. Prisons|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150729081815/http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|archivedate= 2015-07-29|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its theology promotes a [[Racial discrimination|racial]] interpretation of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Eck|first= Diane|year= 2001|authorlink= Diana L.

Christian Identity holds that all non-whites (people not of wholly European descent) on the planet will either be exterminated or enslaved  in order to serve the [[White people|white race]] in the new [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Heavenly Kingdom]] on Earth under the reign of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Its doctrine states that only "Adamic" (white people) can achieve salvation and paradise. Many adherents are [[Millennialism|Millennialist]].

==Origins==
The Christian Identity movement emerged in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot sect of [[British Israelism]].&lt;ref name="Doctrine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement'', Michael Barkun, 1997, Preface, xii, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that "lower races" are mentioned in the [[Bible]] (in contrast to Aryans) was posited in the 1905 book ''Theozoology; or The Science of the Sodomite Apelings and the Divine Electron'' by [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]], a [[Völkisch movement|volkisch]] writer seen by many historians as a major influence on [[Nazism]]. [[Adolf Hitler]], however, did not subscribe to the belief that the Israelites of the Bible were Aryans; in a speech he gave in [[Munich]] in 1920 titled "Why We Are Anti-Semites", he referred to and disparaged [[Abraham]] as racially Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carolynyeager.net/why-we-are-antisemites-text-adolf-hitlers-1920-speech-hofbr%C3%A4uhaus|title="Why We Are Antisemites" - Text of Adolf Hitler's 1920 speech at the Hofbräuhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to British Israelism===
While early British Israelites such as [[Edward Hine]] and [[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]] were [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semites]], Christian Identity emerged in sharp contrast as a strongly antisemitic theology.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as an 'ugly turn':
{{quote|Once on American shores, British-Israelism began to evolve. Originally, believers viewed contemporary Jews as descendants of those ancient Israelites who had never been "lost." They might be seen critically but, given their significant role in the British-Israel genealogical scheme, not usually with animosity. By the 1930s, however, in the U.S., a strain of antisemitism started to permeate the movement (though some maintained traditional beliefs—and a small number of traditionalists still exist in the U.S.)&lt;ref name="Doctrine"/&gt;}}

Another source describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as a "remarkable transition", also noting that traditional British Israelites were advocates of [[philosemitism]] which paradoxically changed to [[antisemitism]] and racism under Christian Identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion'' by Chester L. Quarles, 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, British Israelism itself had several Jewish members, and it received support from [[rabbi]]s throughout the 19th century; within British politics it supported [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who was descended from [[Sephardi Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, pp. 13–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life From The Dead'', 1875, Vol. III, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Christian Identity, which emerged in the 1920s, began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the Jews are not descended from the [[tribe of Judah]] (as British Israelites maintain), but are instead descended from [[Satan]] or Edomite-[[Khazars]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 62–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Israel form of the belief held no antisemitic views; its followers instead held the view that Jews made up a minority of the tribes of Israel (Judah and Benjamin), with the British and other related Northern European peoples making up the remainder.

===Early years===
Christian Identity can be traced back to 1886 with the publication of the book, ''Lost Israel Found in the Anglo-Saxon Race'', by E.P. Ingersoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordiskisrael.dk/artikler/ep_ingersol_lost_israel_found_in_the_anglo_saxon_race.html|title=Lost Israel Found In the Anglo-Saxon Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in the 1920s by the writings of [[Howard Rand]] (1889–1991).&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement'', Charles H. Roberts, 2003, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand was a Massachusetts lawyer who obtained a law degree at the University of Maine. He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to [[J. H. Allen]]'s work ''Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright'' (1902)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reluctant-messenger.com/judahs_sceptre_101.htm|title=Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;''Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement'', Charles H. Roberts, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; While Rand's father was not an antisemite, nor was Rand in his early British Israelite years, Rand first added an antisemitic element to British Israelism in the 1920s. He claimed as early as 1924 that the Jews were not really descended from the [[tribe of Judah]], but were instead the descendants of [[Esau]] or [[Canaanites]].&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rand never claimed that modern Jews were descendants of Satan, or that they were in any way inferior; he just claimed that they were not the true lineal descendants of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 45–60.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Rand is considered a 'transitional' figure from British Israelism to Christian Identity, but not its actual founder.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand is known as the first person to coin the term 'Christian Identity'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phinehas Priesthood: Violent Vanguard of the Christian Identity Movement'', Danny W. Davis, 2010, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Rand had set up the [[Anglo-Saxon Federation of America]] in 1933 which promoted his view that Jews were not descended from Judah; this marked the first key transition from British Israelism to Christian Identity. Beginning in May 1937, there were key meetings of British Israelites in the United States who were attracted to Rand's theory that the Jews were not descended from Judah. This provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of Christian Identity. By the late 1930s the group considered Jews to be the offspring of Satan and demonised them, as they did non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] races.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp. 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Dudley Pelley]], founder of the [[Clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] [[Silver Legion of America|Silver Shirts]] movement, also promoted an anti-semitic form of British Israelism in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lobb, David. 'Fascist Apocalypse: William Pelley and Millennial Extremism', Paper presented at the 4th Annual Conference of the Center for Millennial Studies, November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Links between Christian Identity and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] also emerged in the late 1930s, although the KKK was past the peak of its early 20th century revival.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, pp. 60–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key developers===
[[Wesley A. Swift|Wesley Swift]] (1913–1970) is considered by the [[FBI]] to have been the most significant figure in the early years of the Christian Identity movement. Swift was born in [[New Jersey]], and eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]] in order to attend Bible college. It is claimed that he may have been a "[[Ku Klux Klan]] organizer and a Klan rifle-team instructor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuban-exile.com/doc_026-050/doc0046.html|title=Christian Defense League |author= D. Boylan |date= 2004 |version=Updated 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he founded his own church in [[Lancaster, California]]. In the 1950s, he was [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]'s West Coast representative of the [[Christian Nationalist Crusade]]. In addition, he hosted a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s, through which he was able to proclaim his ideology to a large audience. Due to Swift's efforts, the message of his church spread, leading to the creation of similar churches throughout the country.

In 1957, the name of his church was changed to The Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which is used today by [[Aryan Nations]] (AN) churches. One of Swift's associates was retired Col. [[William Potter Gale]] (1917–1988). According  to claims of unknown reliability, Gale had previously been an aide to General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and had coordinated guerrilla resistance in the [[Philippines]] during [[World War II]]. Gale became a leading figure in the [[Tax protester (United States)|anti-tax]] and [[paramilitary]] movements of the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the [[California Rangers]] and the [[Posse Comitatus (U.S. movement)|Posse Comitatus]], and helping to found the [[militia movement]].

Numerous Christian Identity churches preach similar messages. Some espouse more violent rhetoric than others, but all believe [[Aryan race|Aryans]] to be [[God in Christianity|God]]'s [[chosen people|chosen race]]. Gale introduced future [[Aryan Nations]] founder [[Richard Girnt Butler]] to Swift. Until then, Butler had admired [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] and Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], and had been relatively [[Secularity|secular]]. Swift quickly converted him to Christian Identity. When Swift died, Butler took over the Church, to the apparent dismay of both Gale and Swift's family. Neither Butler nor Gale rivaled Swift as a dynamic orator, and attendance dwindled under the new pastor. Butler eventually renamed the organisation "The Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations" and moved it to [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]].

Lesser figures participated as Christian Identity theology took shape in the 1940s and 1950s, such as [[San Jacinto Capt]], a [[Baptist]] minister and California [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] (who claimed that he had introduced Wesley Swift to Christian Identity); and [[Bertrand Comparet]] (1901–1983), one-time [[San Diego]] Deputy City Attorney (and lawyer for [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]). But for the most part, today's Christian Identity groups seem to have been generated by Wesley Swift, through his lieutenants William Potter Gale and Richard Butler.

==Tenets==
Rather than being an organized religion, Christian Identity ("CI") is adhered to by individuals, [[local church|independent congregations]] and some prison gangs&lt;ref name="BehindBars"/&gt; with a [[white supremacist]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Diane|year=2001|authorlink=Diana L. Eck|title=A New Religious America: How a "Christian Country" Has Become the World's Most Religiously Diverse Nation|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buck|first=Christopher|title=Religious Myths and Visions of America: How Minority Faiths Redefined America's World Role|year=2009|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-35959-0|pages=107, 108, 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; that promotes a [[racial]] interpretation of [[Christianity]]. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered Europeans to be the [[chosen people]] and [[Jews]] to be the cursed offspring of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], the "serpent hybrid" (or [[Serpent seed]]) (a belief known as the two-seedline doctrine). An early Christian Identity teacher, [[Wesley A. Swift]] (1913–1970), formulated the doctrine that non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] peoples have no [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] and therefore can never earn God's favor or be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quarles|first=Chester L.|title=Christian Identity: The Aryan American Bloodline Religion|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5BzY2eeyngC&amp;pg=PA68|isbn=978-0-7864-1892-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Carol|title=Killing for Life: The Apocalyptic Narrative of Pro-Life Politics|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8819-1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theology was promoted by [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] (1918 – 1967), the founder of the [[American Nazi Party]].

No single document expresses the Christian Identity belief system; there is much disagreement over the doctrines being taught by those ascribing to CI beliefs, since there is no central organization or headquarters for the CI sect. However, all CI adherents believe that Adam and his offspring were exclusively White and that the other [[pre-Adamite]] races are separate species, which cannot be either equated with or derived from the Adamites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglo-saxonisrael.com/content/beast-field|title=Anglo-Saxon Israel – Beast of the Field}}&lt;/ref&gt; CI adherents cite passages from the [[Old Testament]], including [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+9%3A2&amp;version=KJV Ezra 9:2], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+9%3A12&amp;version=KJV 12] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=nehemiah+13%3A27&amp;version=KJV Nehemiah 13:27], which they claim contain injunctions by [[Yahweh]] against [[interracial marriage]]s. Christian Identity believers reject the doctrines of most contemporary Christian denominations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.faithweb.com/About/|title=What is Christian Identity?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they believe that the doctrine which advocates the view that God's promises to Israel (through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) have been expanded to create a spiritual people of "Israel", i.e., the [[Christian Church]], is [[heretical|heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelite-identity-archive.blogspot.com/2014/12/could-you-be-israelite-and-not-know-it.html|title=Could You Be An Israelite And Not Know It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Identity movement first received widespread attention from the mainstream media in 1984, when the [[white nationalist]] organization known as [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] embarked on a murderous crime spree before it was suppressed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. [[Tax evasion|Tax resister]] and [[militia movement]] organizer [[Gordon Kahl]], whose death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities helped inspire The Order, also had connections to the Christian Identity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/SCM.asp|title=Sovereign Citizen Movement – Extremism in America|publisher=Adl.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729014548/http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/SCM.asp|archivedate=2005-07-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|work=The New York Times|first=Wayne|last=King|title=Books of The Times; A Farmer's Fatal Obsession With Jews and Taxes|date=August 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the deadly [[Ruby Ridge]] confrontation, when newspapers discovered that former [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] and [[right-wing]] separatist [[Randy Weaver]] had at least a loose association with Christian Identity believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1993/10/01/ambush-at-ruby-ridge|work=Reason|date=October 1, 1993|author=Alan W. Bock|title=Ambush at Ruby Ridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups are estimated to have two thousand members in the United States&lt;ref name="Barkun 1996 x"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barkun|first=Michael|year=1996|title=Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement|pages=x|chapter=preface|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-4638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an unknown number in Canada and the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. Due to the promotion of Christian Identity doctrines through radio and later through the Internet, an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold Christian Identity beliefs.&lt;ref name="Barkun 1996 x" /&gt; The primary spread of Christian Identity teachings is believed to be through white supremacist prison gangs.&lt;ref name=adl /&gt;

==Beliefs==
Christian Identity asserts that the white people of Europe or Caucasians in general are God's servant people, according to the promises that were given to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. It further asserts that the early European tribes were really the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of Israel and therefore the rightful heirs to God's promises, and God's chosen people. [[Colin Kidd]] wrote that in America, Christian Identity exploited "the puzzle of the Ten Lost Tribes to justify an openly anti-Semitic and virulently racist agenda."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600–2000'', 2006, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two House Theology===
Like British Israelites, Christian Identity (CI) adherents believe in [[Two House theology|Two House Theology]], which makes a distinction between the [[Tribe of Judah]] and the [[Ten Lost Tribes]].&lt;ref name="Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60"&gt;Charles H. Roberts, pp.40–60&lt;/ref&gt; However the major difference between British Israelism and CI is that British Israelites have always maintained that Jews are descended from the tribe of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, F. E, ''The Bible Distinction Between the House of Israel and the House of Judah'', Radio Address, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, while also maintaining a Two House distinction, Christian Identity proponents believe that the true lineal descendants of Judah are ''not'' contemporary Jews, but are instead White Europeans whose ancestors settled mainly in [[Scotland]], [[Germany]], and other European nations, alongside the [[House of Israel]]. In short, Christian Identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day Jews, the true descendents of the Houses of Israel and Judah are the modern-day Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Germanic, Nordic, and kindred peoples.&lt;ref name="Charles H. Roberts, pp.40-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name=archive1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/BasicIdentity1|title=Basic Christian Identity : Dr. Wesley A. Swift : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|publisher=Archive.org|date=2001-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some CI scholars teach the belief that many contemporary Jews are the descendants of [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], citing [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&amp;c=3&amp;v=15&amp;t=KJV#15 Genesis 3:15], [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Jhn&amp;c=8&amp;v=44&amp;t=KJV#44 John 8:44] and [http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Jo&amp;c=3&amp;t=KJV#12 1 John 3:12] in support of their position; they also teach that Cain was the spawn of [[Satan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://study.faithweb.com/study/Serpentseed.html|title=Jewish Rabbis recognize Serpent Seedline as well as Sumerians, Targums and Biblical Accounts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin beliefs===
Identity teaches that "Israel" was the name given to [[Jacob]] after he [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestled with the angel]] at Peniel as described in Genesis 32:26–32. "Israel" then had twelve sons, which began the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} In 975 BC the ten northern tribes revolted, seceded from the south, and became the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} After they were subsequently conquered by [[Assyria]] at approximately 721 BC, the ten tribes disappeared from the Biblical record and became known as the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}}

According to Identity doctrine, [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2+esdras+13:39-13:46&amp;version=nrsvae 2 Esdras 13:39–46] then records the history of the nation of Israel journeying over the [[Caucasus mountains]], along the [[Black Sea]], to the [[Siret River|Ar Sereth]] tributary of the [[Danube]] in [[Romania]] ("But they formed this plan for themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the nations and go to a more distant region, where no human beings had ever lived. … Through that region there was a long way to go, a journey of a year and a half; and that country is called Arzareth").&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} The tribes prospered, and eventually colonised other European countries. Israel's leading tribe, the [[Tribe of Dan]], is attributed with settling and naming many areas which are today distinguished by place names derived from its name – written ancient Hebrew contains no vowels, and hence "Dan" would be written as DN, but would be pronounced with an intermediate vowel dependent on the local dialect, meaning that ''Dan'', ''Den'', ''Din'', ''Don'', and ''Dun'' all have the same meaning.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}} Various modern place names are said to derive from the name of this tribe:&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}}

Some followers claim that the Identity genealogy of the [[Davidic line]] can be traced to the royal rulers of Britain and [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] herself.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|102–105}} Thus [[Anglo-Saxons]] are the true [[Israelites]], God's chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|101}}

===Adamites and pre-Adamites===
A major tenet of Christian Identity is the [[pre-Adamite]] hypothesis. Christian Identity followers believe that [[Adam and Eve]] are only the ancestors of [[white people]], and that Adam and Eve were preceded by [[Untermensch|lesser]], non-Caucasian races which are often (although not always) identified as "beasts of the field";&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Genesis|1:25|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the "beasts" which wore sackcloth and cried unto God ({{bibleref|Jonah|3:8|ESV}}) are identified as [[Black people|black races]] by Christian Identity adherents.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} To support their theory on the racial identity of Adam, Christian Identity proponents point out that the Hebrew etymology of the word 'Adam' translates as 'be ruddy, red, to show blood (in the face)' often quoting from [[James Strong (theologian)|James Strong]]'s ''Hebrew Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew Dictionary #119 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; and from this they conclude that only Caucasians or people with light white skin can blush or turn rosy in the face (because [[hemoglobin]] is only visible under pale skin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxonisrael.com/docBibStudies/KingdomBasics.html|title=Basics for Understanding Yahweh's Kingdom|publisher=Anglo-Saxon Israel|date=2009-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723113840/http://www.anglo-saxonisrael.com/docBibStudies/KingdomBasics.html|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Christian Identity believe that Adam was only created six thousand years ago, while the other, non-Caucasian races were created during far older epochs that occurred on the other continents.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

===Serpent seed===
{{see also|Serpent seed}}
Dual Seedline Christian Identity proponents— those who believe that [[Serpent seed|Eve bore children with Satan]] as well as with Adam —believe that Eve was seduced by [[Serpents in the Bible|the Serpent]] ([[Satan]]), shared her fallen state with Adam by lying down with him, and gave birth to [[Superfecundation|twins with different fathers]]: Satan's son [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] and Adam's son [[Cain and Abel|Abel]]. This belief is referred to as the [[serpent seed]] doctrine. According to the "dual seedline" form of Christian Identity, Cain then became the progenitor of the Jews in his subsequent matings with members of the non-Adamic races.

The serpent seed idea, which ascribes the ancestry of legendary monsters such as [[Grendel]] to Cain,&lt;ref name=archive1 /&gt; was somewhat widespread in the [[Middle Ages]]. It also appears in early [[Gnostic Gospels|Gnostic Christian texts]] as well as in some Jewish texts, for example a 9th-century book titled ''[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]]''.&lt;ref name="Eichhorn, D. 1985"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-940646-19-6|title=Cain: Son of the Serpent|authorlink=Eichhorn, D.|year=1985|publisher=Rossel Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Cain: Son of the Serpent'', [[David Max Eichhorn]], traces the idea back to early Jewish [[Midrash|Midrashic texts]] and he identifies many rabbis who taught the belief that Cain was the son of a union between the Serpent and Eve.&lt;ref name="Eichhorn, D. 1985" /&gt;

Some [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] rabbis also believe that Cain and Abel were of a different genetic background than [[Seth]]. This teaching is based on the theory that God created two "Adams" (''adam'' means "man" in [[Hebrew]]). To one he gave a soul and to the other he did not give a soul. The one without a soul is the creature known in Christianity as the Serpent. The Kabbalists call the serpent the ''Nahash'' (which means the ''serpent'' in Hebrew).

This is recorded in the [[Zohar]]:

{{quote|Two beings [Adam and Nachash] had intercourse with Eve, and she conceived from both and bore two children. Each followed one of the male parents, and their spirits parted, one to this side and one to the other, and similarly their characters. On the side of Cain are all the haunts of the evil species; from the side of Abel comes a more merciful class, yet not wholly beneficial – good wine mixed with bad.| Zohar 136}}

A seminal influence on the Christian Identity movement's views on pre-Adamism was a book published in 1900 by [[Charles Carroll (author)|Charles Carroll]] titled ''The Negro a Beast or In the Image of God?''. In the book Carroll concluded that Adam only gave birth to the White race and the White race was made in the image and likeness of God, while [[African peoples|Negroes]] are pre-Adamite beasts who could not possibly have been made in God's image and likeness because they are beast-like, [[Immorality|immoral]] and [[Beauty#Ugliness|ugly]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carroll The Negro a beast"; or, "In the image of God"; the reasoner of the age, the revelator of the century! The Bible as it is! The Negro and his relation to the human family! The Negro not the son of Ham, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races such as blacks did not have souls. Carroll believed that [[Miscegenation|race mixing]] was an insult to God because it spoiled His racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of [[Atheism]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600–2000'', p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creationism===
Christian Identity proponents believe that both the universe and Earth are billions of years old and that non-Caucasian races were created hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago. However, they believe that [[Adam]] (who was the father of the white race or [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]]) was only created around 6,000 years ago.

[[Wesley Swift]] strongly criticised [[Young Earth Creationism]] and the traditional Judeo-Christian view that [[Biblical flood|Noah's flood]] was global. He instead believed that the flood was only local and that the Earth was billions of years old.&lt;ref name=archive1 /&gt; Christian Identity adherents claim that the flood in Genesis only rose high enough to drown the region of the [[Tarim Basin]] below sea level (Gen. 7:20) and that therefore the Hebrew word "eretz" which appears in those verses should be rendered "the land" (as in a specific place) rather than "the earth."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Racialism===
{{see also|Curse of Ham}}
[[Racialism]], or race-based philosophy, is the core tenet of Christian Identity, and most CI adherents are [[white nationalists]] who support [[racial segregation]]. Some CI adherents believe that Jews are genetically compelled by their Satanic or Edomite ancestry to carry on a conspiracy against the Adamic seedline and that Jews have today achieved almost complete control of the Earth through their claim to the white race's status as God's [[chosen people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/who-are-jews.html|title=Who are the Jews? By: Bertrand Comparet|publisher=Church of True Israel|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225125047/http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/who-are-jews.html|archivedate=2007-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, Christian Identity followers adhere to the traditional Christian views on the role of women (See [[Biblical patriarchy]]), [[abortion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homosexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they believe that racial [[miscegenation]] is a sin and a violation of God's law in Genesis 1:24–25 which commands that all creatures should produce "kind after kind."

In addition to their strict fundamentalist racial views Christian Identity adherents distinguish themselves from mainstream [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian fundamentalism|Fundamentalism]] in various areas of theology. Some Christian Identity adherents follow the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic law]] of the [[Old Testament]] (e.g., [[Kashrut|dietary restrictions]], the [[seventh-day Sabbath]] and certain annual festivals such as [[Passover]]). It is also commonplace for some Christian Identity adherents to follow the [[Sacred Name Movement]] and they insist on using the original Hebrew names when referring to [[God in Christianity|God]] ([[Yahweh]]) and [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] ([[Yeshua|Yahshua]]). Some Christian Identity writers criticize modern Bible editions as well as the Jews for their removal of the original Hebrew name of God from the Bible. Although their adherence to Old Testament Mosaic law may make them appear "Jewish"; they claim that the Jewish interpretation of the law has been corrupted through the Jews' [[Talmud]]. Unlike many Protestant Fundamentalists, Christian Identity adherents reject the notion of a [[Rapture]], believing it to be a Judaized doctrine which the Bible does not teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/compthief.html|title=I Come as a Thief|publisher=Church of True Israel|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821152305/http://www.churchoftrueisrael.com/comparet/compthief.html|archivedate=2007-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial politics and economics===
Christian Identity politics was first reviewed by [[Howard Rand]] and [[William J. Cameron]] after the [[Great Depression]]. In 1943, Rand published the article "Digest of the Divine Law" which discussed the political and economic challenges at that time. An excerpt from the article states: "We shall not be able to continue in accord with the old order. Certain groups are already planning an economy of regimentation for our nation; but it will only intensify the suffering and want of the past and bring to our peoples all the evils that will result from such planning by a group of men who are failing to take into consideration the fundamental principles underlying the law of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael|title=Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement|date=1997|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=0-8078-2328-7|page=202|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Rand never formally admitted to what groups he was specifically referring, his hatred for Jews, [[racial integration]], and the country's economic state at the time made the direction of his comments obvious. Identifying specific economic problems was not the only goal which Rand had in mind. He began to analyze how to make these changes happen through legal changes; thus creating strategic plans to integrate the Bible into American law and economics. The first goal was to denounce all man-made laws and to replace them with laws from the Bible. The second goal was to create an economic state that would reflect teachings from the bible.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Howard Rand and William Cameron believed in these principles and this was because according to Christian Identity's teachings, they possessed access to knowledge about God's law that no one else does. Since they had access to more information, they were responsible for influencing current civil law in order to maintain God's standards.

While William Cameron agreed with Rand's initial argument, he focused his writings more specifically on changing American economics. One of Cameron's articles "The Economic Law of God" spoke of the Bible supporting individualism and social justice in regards to economics. He also believed that the government had no right to tax land, or other forms of property. In accordance with this doctrine, tax refunds should be applied to family vacation trips or be applied to national festivals for Christian Identity movements.&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press"&gt;Barkun. {{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also for the betterment of the United States' economic future, no interest should be applied to accounts paid with credit, and no taxes should be imputed during the traveling time of goods from a manufacturer to the consumer.&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press" /&gt;

The mutual point which both Rand and Cameron shared, was that while they may have disagreed with how the government was operating, neither men resisted the current tax policies. [[Gordon Kahl]] was the first CI believer who took the founding principles from Rand and Cameron, and applied them in order to take action against the government.&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press" /&gt; Kahl believed that the men were on the right track in regards to what needed to be accomplished in order to change public policies, however he felt that without taking action against violators, no real changes would be made. In 1967 he stopped paying taxes because he felt he was paying "tithes to the Synagogue of Satan." Years later, Gordon Kahl, the CI farmer from [[North Dakota]], took it upon himself to kill two federal marshals in 1983. Before he was caught for the murders, Kahl wrote a note in which he said "our nation has fallen into the hands of alien people. … These enemies of Christ have taken their Jewish Communist Manifesto and incorporated it into the Statutory Laws of our country and thrown our Constitution and our Christian Common Law into the garbage can."&lt;ref name="University of North Carolina Press" /&gt;

===World's end and Armageddon===
Christian Identity supporters believe in the [[Second Coming]] and [[Armageddon]]. Predictions vary, including a [[race war]] or a Jewish-backed [[United Nations]] takeover of the US, and they endorse physical struggle against what they see as the forces of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Jeffrey|title=Millennial Violence: Past, Present, and Future|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7146-5294-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qb92tBxVOZgC&amp;pg=PA37|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscegenation, homosexuality, and anti-Semitism===
Identity asserts that [[disease]], [[addiction]], [[cancer]], and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s ([[herpes]] and [[HIV/AIDS]]) are spread by human "rodents" via contact with "unclean" persons, such as "[[Miscegenation|race-mixers]]".&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|85}} The [[apocrypha]], [[Book of Enoch|the first book of Enoch]], is used to justify these social theories; the fallen angels of Heaven sexually desired Earth maidens and took them as wives, resulting in the birth of [[Abomination (Bible)|abominations]], which God ordered [[Michael the Archangel]] to destroy, thus beginning a cosmic war between Light and Darkness.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|85}} The mixing of separate things (e.g., people of different races) is seen as defiling both, and it is also considered a violation of God's law.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|86}}

Identity preachers proclaim that, according to the Bible, "the penalties for race-mixing, homo-sexuality, and usury are death."&lt;ref name=aho&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Righteousness: Idaho Christian Patriotism|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1995|page=86|author=James Alfred Aho|isbn=0-295-97494-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}} The justification for killing homosexuals is provided in Leviticus 20:13 "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:35–37 and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] explicitly condemn [[usury]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|92}}  Ezekiel 18:13 states "He who hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him" and is quoted as justification for killing Jews.

Identity followers reject the label "antisemitic", stating that they cannot be antisemitic, since the true [[Semitic people|Semites]] "today are the great White Christian nations of the western world", with modern Jews in fact being descendants of the [[Canaan#Biblical Canaanites|Canaanites]].&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;

===Anti-banking system===
Identity doctrine asserts that the "root of all evil" is paper money (in particular [[Federal Reserve Note]]s), and that usury and banking systems are controlled by Jews.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|87}} The creation of the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913 shifted control of money from Congress to private institutions and violated the Constitution. The money system encourages the [[Federal Reserve]] to take out loans, creating trillions of dollars of government debt and allowing international bankers to control America. Credit/debit cards and computerised bills are seen as the fulfillment of the Biblical scripture warning against "the beast" (i.e., banking) as quoted in Revelation 13:15–18. Identity preacher Sheldon Emry claims "Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern European (Jewish) ancestry and connected with the (Jewish) [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild European banks]]", thus, in Identity doctrine, the global banking conspiracy is led and controlled by Jewish interests.&lt;ref name=aho /&gt;{{rp|91}}

==Groups==
Christian Identity is a major unifying [[theology]] for a number of diverse groups of [[white nationalist]] Christians. It is a belief system that provides its members with a religious basis for racial separatism. [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] is inaccurately described by some of his critics, as well as by supporters of Christian Identity, as having supported Christian Identity, due to his belief in a modified form of British Israelism, and the fact that during his lifetime, he propounded observances favoured by many Christian Identity groups, such as [[seventh-day Sabbatarianism]] and biblical festivals. The [[Worldwide Church of God]] which Armstrong founded did not subscribe to the anti-Semitism commonly espoused by the Christian or Israel Identity groups but instead adhered to the traditional beliefs of British Israelism; i.e., the belief that modern day Jews are descendants of the [[Tribe of Judah]] whereas the [[Anglo-Saxons]], [[Celts]], [[Danes]], etc. are descendants of the remaining Ten Tribes of Israel formerly known as the Northern Kingdom.

Christian Identity groups include "[[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]", the [[Phineas Priesthood]], the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia, also known as The Universal Church of God. Christian Identity is also adhered to by other groups such as [[Aryan Nations]], the [[Aryan Republican Army]] (ARA) and the [[Patriots Council]], [[Church of Jesus Christ Christian]], [[Thomas Robb]], [[LaPorte Church of Christ]], Mission To Israel, Folk And Faith, Jubilee, Traditionalist Youth Network, Yahweh's Truth ([[James Wickstrom]]), Church of Israel&lt;ref name=adl&gt;{{cite web|title=Extremism in America: Dan Gayman|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/gayman.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=gayman|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929194615/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/gayman.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=gayman|archivedate=2012-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaymangate.com/JoplinGlobe1-28-2001-1.pdf|title=Separatist by faith: Church of Israel's patriarch rebuts claims of racism|author=Max McCoy|publisher=''Joplin Globe''|date=28 January 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222054659/http://www.gaymangate.com/JoplinGlobe1-28-2001-1.pdf|archivedate=22 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Shepherd's Chapel]] and [[Kingdom Identity Ministries]].

[[South Africa]]n branches of Christian Identity have been accused of involvement in terrorist activities, including the [[2002 Soweto bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title='Volk' Faith and Fatherland: The Security Threat Posed by the White Right|author=Martin Schönteich and Henri Boshoff|isbn=1-919913-30-0|publisher=Pretoria, South Africa, Institute for Security Studies|year=2003|url=http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap4.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411190412/http://www.iss.co.za/Pubs/Monographs/No81/Chap4.html|archivedate=2006-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Christian Identity groups include the Heritage Christian Church and the Legion for the Survival of Freedom.

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
'''Classical Marxism''' refers to the economic, philosophical and sociological theories expounded by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as contrasted with later developments in [[Marxism]], especially [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]].

==Karl Marx==
[[File:Marx4.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] in 1861]]
{{details|Karl Marx}}
Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818, [[Trier]], [[German Confederation|Germany]] &amp;ndash; March 14, 1883, [[London]]) was an immensely influential German [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[political economist]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]. Marx addressed a wide range of issues, including [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and exploitation of the worker, the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism, although he is most famous for his analysis of history in terms of class struggles, summed up in the opening line of the introduction to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'': "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". The influence of his ideas, already popular during his life, was given added impetus by the victory of the [[Russia]]n [[Bolsheviks]] in the 1917 [[October Revolution]] and there are few parts of the world which were not significantly touched by Marxian ideas in the course of the twentieth century.

As the American Marx scholar [[Hal Draper]] remarked: "[T]here are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".

===Early influences===
{{main|The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism}}
{{details|Influences on Karl Marx}}
The early influences on Marx are often grouped into three categories: German philosophy, English/Scottish political economy and French socialism.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/mar/x01.htm The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism]''&amp;nbsp;by [[Vladimir I. Lenin]] at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====German philosophy====
Main influences include [[Immanuel Kant]]; [[G. W. F. Hegel]]; and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. 

Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of [[Young Hegelians]] to whom Marx attached himself. However, from 1841 he and Engels came to disagree with Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic and progressively broke away from [[German idealism]] and the Young Hegelians. Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head", in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]"). But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic.

====English and Scottish political economy====
Main influences include [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. 

Marx built on and critiqued the most well-known political economists of his day, the British classical political economists.

Marx critiqued Smith and Ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions, not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies. He proposed a systematic correlation between labour-values and money prices. He claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages. This mechanism operated through the distinction between "labour power", which workers freely exchanged for their wages; and "labour", over which asset-holding capitalists thereby gained control. This practical and theoretical distinction was Marx's primary insight, and allowed him to develop the concept of "surplus value", which distinguished his works from that of Smith and Ricardo.

====French socialism====
Main influences include [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]; [[Charles Fourier]]; [[Henri de Saint-Simon]]; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and [[Louis Blanc]].

Rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of [[private property]] and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern [[socialism]] and [[communism]], though Marx rarely mentions Rousseau in his writings.

In 1833, France was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. A number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the [[Left-wing politics|political left]]. Among the more grandiose were the plans of [[Charles Fourier]] and the followers of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]. Fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the Saint-Simonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit. Although these programs did not have much support, they did expand the political and social imagination of Marx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – France |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html#p464 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR60qYA?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568934_23/France.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Blanc]] is perhaps best known for originating the social principle, later adopted by Marx, of how labor and income should be distributed: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta – Communism |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html#p9 |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR6a1r6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241/Communism.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] participated in the February 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed "the first republican proclamation" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform, ''Solution du problème social'', in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. It was Proudhon's book ''[[What Is Property?]]'' that convinced the young Karl Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon|first=Pierre-Joseph|title=What is property?|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602060944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other influences on Marx====
Main influences includes [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek]] [[materialism]]; [[Giambattista Vico]]; and [[Lewis H. Morgan]].

Marx's revision of [[Hegelianism]] was also influenced by Engels' book  ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]'' in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.

Marx was influenced by Antique materialism, especially [[Epicurus]] (to whom Marx dedicated his thesis,  ''[[The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature]]'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of liberty.

[[Giambattista Vico]] propounded a [[cyclical theory]] of history, according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism. In the first stage—called the Age of the Gods—religion, the family and other basic institutions emerge; in the succeeding Age of Heroes, the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles; in the final stage—the Age of Men—the people rebel and win equality, but in the process society begins to disintegrate. Vico's influence on Marx is obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSN Encarta - Giambattista Vico |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |website= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwR5SlMg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551498/Giambattista_Vico.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx drew on [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and his [[social evolution]] theory. He wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of Lewis Morgan, but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions. (However Engels is much more noticeably influenced by Morgan than Marx).

==Friedrich Engels==
{{details|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Friedrich Engels]] was a co-founder and proponent of [[Marxism]]]]
Friedrich Engels (November 28, 1820, [[Wuppertal]] – August 5, 1895, [[London]]) was a nineteenth-century German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He developed [[Communism|communist]] theory alongside his better-known collaborator, [[Karl Marx]].

In 1842, his father sent the young Engels to England to help manage his cotton factory in Manchester. Shocked by the widespread [[poverty]], Engels began writing an account which he published in 1845 as ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm]).

In July 1845, Engels went to England, where he met an Irish working-class woman named [[Mary Burns]] ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/manchester/article_4.shtml Crosby]), with whom he lived until her death in 1863 (Carver 2003:19). Later, Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, marrying her the day before she died in 1877 (Carver 2003:42). These women may have introduced him to the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement, of whose leaders he met several, including [[George Julian Harney|George Harney]].

Engels actively participated in the [[Revolution of 1848]], taking part in the uprising at [[Elberfeld]]. Engels fought in the [[Baden campaign]] against the [[Prussia]]ns (June/July 1849) as the [[aide-de-camp]] of [[August Willich]], who commanded a Free Corps in the Baden-Palatinate uprising. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/german-imperial/ch01.htm]

===Marx and Engels===
Marx and Engels first met in person in September 1844. They discovered that they had similar views on [[philosophy]] and on [[capitalism]] and decided to work together, producing a number of works including ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After the French authorities deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx decided to move to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than some other countries in Europe. Engels and Marx returned to Brussels in January 1846, where they set up the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, Engels and Marx began writing a pamphlet together, based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. They completed the 12,000-word pamphlet in six weeks, writing it in such a manner as to make communism understandable to a wide audience and published it as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled both Engels and Marx. They moved to Cologne, where they began to publish a radical newspaper, the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]''. By 1849, both Engels and Marx had to leave Germany and moved to London. The Prussian authorities applied pressure on the British government to expel the two men, but [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] refused. With only the money that Engels could raise, the Marx family lived in extreme poverty. The contributions of Marx and Engels to the formation of Marxist theory have been described as inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[Franz Mehring]]: “The more their thought and their development became one, the more they each remained a separate entity and a man”, in Mehring: ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (1918), Chapter 8 Marx and Engels [http://www.marxists.org/archive/mehring/1918/marx/ch08.htm#s2 2. An Incomparable Alliance]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
Marx's main ideas included:
* [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]]: Marx refers to the alienation of people from aspects of their "human nature" ("''Gattungswesen''", usually translated as "species-essence" or "species-being"). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and in so doing generate alienated labour.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Alienation&lt;/ref&gt; Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism—it is not necessary for them to believe or feel that they are alienated.
* [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|Base and superstructure]]: Marx and Engels use the “base-structure” concept to explain the idea that the totality of relations among people with regard to “the social production of their existence” forms the economic basis, on which arises a superstructure of political and legal institutions. To the base corresponds the social consciousness which includes religious, philosophical and other main ideas. The base conditions both, the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production causes social revolutions and the resulting change in the economic basis will sooner or later lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See Marx: ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas,
and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; For Marx, this relationship is not a one way process—it is reflexive and the base determines the superstructure in the first instance at the same time as it remains the foundation of a form of social organization which is itself transformed as an element in the overall dialectical process. The relationship between superstructure and base is considered to be a [[dialectics|dialectical]] one, [[ineffability|ineffable]] in a sense except as it unfolds in its material reality in the actual historical process (which [[scientific socialism]] aims to explain and ultimately to guide).
* [[Class consciousness]]: class consciousness refers to the awareness, both of itself and of the social world around it, that a [[social class]] possesses and its capacity to act in its own rational interests based on this awareness. Thus class consciousness must be attained before the class may mount a successful revolution. However, other methods of revolutionary action have been developed, such as [[vanguardism]].
* [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|Exploitation]]: Marx refers to the exploitation of an entire segment or class of society by another. He sees it as being an inherent feature and key element of capitalism and free markets. The profit gained by the capitalist is the difference between the value of the product made by the worker and the actual wage that the worker receives—in other words, capitalism functions on the basis of paying workers less than the full value of their labor in order to enable the capitalist class to turn a profit.
* [[Historical materialism]]: historical materialism was first articulated by Marx, although he himself never used the term. It looks for the causes of developments and changes in human societies in the way in which humans collectively make the means to life, thus giving an emphasis through economic analysis to everything that co-exists with the economic base of society (e.g. social classes, political structures, ideologies).
* [[Means of production]]: the means of production are a combination of the [[means of labor]] and the [[subject of labor]] used by workers to make products. The means of labor include machines, tools, equipment, infrastructure and "all those things with the aid of which man acts upon the subject of labor, and transforms it".&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (1957). xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of labor includes raw materials and materials directly taken from nature. Means of production by themselves produce nothing— [[labour (economics)|labor power]] is needed for production to take place.
* [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|Ideology]]: without offering a general definition for "ideology",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney:
''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx on several instances has used the term to designate the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, “ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces”.&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London July 14, 1893), transl. by Donna Torr, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society as well as its ruling ideas will be determined according to what is in the ruling class's best interests. As Marx said famously in ''The German Ideology'', “the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm  Karl Marx, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the ideology of a society is of enormous importance since it confuses the alienated groups and can create [[false consciousness]] such as commodity fetishism (perceiving labor as capital—a degradation of human life).
* [[Mode of production]]: the mode of production is a specific combination of [[productive forces]] (including human the [[means of production]] and [[labour power]], tools, equipment, buildings and technologies, materials and improved land) and social and technical [[relations of production]] (including the property, power and control relations governing society's productive assets, often codified in law, cooperative work relations and forms of association, relations between people and the objects of their work and the relations between social classes).
* [[Political economy]]: the term "political economy" originally meant the study of the conditions under which production was organized in the nation-states of the new-born capitalist system. Political economy then studies the mechanism of human activity in organizing material and the mechanism of distributing the surplus or deficit that is the result of that activity. Political economy studies the means of production, specifically capital and how this manifests itself in economic activity.

===Marx's concept of class===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2012}}
Marx believed that class identity was configured in the relations with the mode of production. In other words, a class is a collective of individuals who have a similar relationship with the means of production (as opposed to the more common-sense idea that class is determined by wealth alone, i.e. high class, middle class and poor class).

Marx describes several [[social class]]es in capitalist societies, including primarily:
* The [[proletariat]]: "those individuals who sell their [[labor power]], (and therefore add value to the products), and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". According to Marx, the capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions for the [[bourgeoisie]] to [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]] the proletariat due to the fact that the worker's [[labor power]] generates an [[Surplus value|added value]] greater than his [[salary]].
* The [[bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy [[labor power]] from the proletariat, who are recompensed by a salary, thus [[Exploitation of labour#Marxian theory|exploit]]ing the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie may be further subdivided into the very wealthy bourgeoisie and the [[petty bourgeoisie]]. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves. These may be small proprietors, land-holding peasants, or trade workers. Marx predicted that the petty bourgeoisie would eventually be destroyed by the constant reinvention of the means of production and the result of this would be the forced movement of the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie to the proletariat. Marx also identified the [[lumpenproletariat]], a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.

Marx also describes the [[communists]] as separate from the oppressed proletariat. The communists were to be a unifying party among the proletariat; they were educated revolutionaries who could bring the proletariat to revolution and help them establish the democratic [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Communist Manifesto]] 80-87&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, the communists would support any true revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Thus the communists aide the proletariat in creating the inevitable classless society ([[Vladimir Lenin]] takes this concept a step further by stating that only "professional revolutionaries" can lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie).

===Marx's theory of history===
{{main|Marx's theory of history}}
The Marxist theory of historical materialism understands society as fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time—this means the relationships which people enter into with one another in order to fulfill their basic needs, for instance to feed and clothe themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Marx and Engels identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". (Marx, Karl, Letter to editor of the Russian paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym, 1877) His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31950">'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. It was related to "philosophical history", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of [[rational reconstruction]] that had little contact with evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects : With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith': With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon MacIntyre|title=Dugald Stewart: The Pride and Ornament of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFVh-i3Z04C&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-34-5|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Palmeri|title=Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrp6ZZQmiYC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-829-0|pages=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to [[humankind]], even at the cost of detailed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet and Costa, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative "moral science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of [[feudalism]] and early ethnographical reports from European travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart the ''Dissertation on the Origin of Languages'' by [[Adam Smith]] was an important example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=scottish-18th |title=Scottish Philosophy in the 18th Century |last=Broadie |first=Alexander|Thu Aug 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of [[human nature]], or as Stewart put it, the "capacities of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alexander Broadie |title=The Scottish Enlightenment: An Anthology|year=1997 |publisher=Canongate Books |isbn=978-0-86241-738-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, pp. 223–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist [[Samuel Pufendorf]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Fitzpatrick|author2=Peter Jones|author3=Christa Knellwolf|author4=Iain McCalman|title=Enlightenment World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFy4wZ6Bz0C&amp;pg=PT258|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-60784-6|pages=258–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]] had already used conjectural history to discuss [[Aquinas]] on [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hont|title=Jealousy Of Trade: International Competition and the Nation State in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHu6kBLV4CUC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01038-3|pages=422–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&amp;pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2362-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9bOow5IFUwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/&gt; Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included [[primate]]s and [[feral children]] as material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Broadie|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtda5SVxaF4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00323-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson in his ''History of America'' moves between narrative and conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Ferguson, ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767)===
{{details|An Essay on the History of Civil Society}}
Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called [[barbarian]] or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, pp. 330–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the [[foundation story]] in the style of classical history, proposing instead that [[unintended consequences]] could have more to do with the "establishment" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Millar, ''Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society'' (1771)===
Millar argued in terms of a "system of manners" associated with each of the four stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chandler|title=England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqWLrZ3UEvcC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=26 June 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10109-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Measuring Time, Making History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=Enlightenment|year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the [[experimental moral philosophy]] of [[Thomas Reid]] and [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt; The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sketches'' was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Sauer|title=Reading the Nation in English Literature: A Critical Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEcG669IWIC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44524-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a "history of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Alan Barnard|author2=Jonathan Spencer|title=Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1VpdrbH3BUC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-45803-7|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Trentmann|title=Paradoxes of Civil Society: New Perspectives on Modern German and British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ry0AybYtwEC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-143-1|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779). Kames was an early [[polygenist]], or was an [[environmental monogenist]] only with scepticism about the adequacy of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John P. Jackson, Jr.|author2=Nadine M.

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.&lt;ref name="Broich"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith':|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.&lt;ref name="Burrow1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted.&lt;ref name="Broich"/&gt; Hopfl has said that the heirs were [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the "tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism" having become apparent, to [[utilitarianism]] and vaguer [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Hawthorn |title=Enlightenment and Despair: A History of Social Theory |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-33721-6 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious opposition===
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, pp. 20–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crippen Point site''' is a [[Coles Creek culture]] [[archaeological site]] located in [[Sharkey County, Mississippi]]. It is the archaeological [[type site]] of the Crippen Point phase(1050 to 1200 CE) for Late Coles Creek culture in the Lower [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley. The phase marks a significant change in the cultural history of the area. Population increased dramatically and there is strong evidence of a growing cultural and political complexity by this portion of the Coles Creek sequence. Although many of the classic traits of [[chiefdom]] societies are not yet manifested, by 1000 CE the formation of simple elite polities had begun. Sites for this phase are found in [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]]. After the Crippen Point phase the [[Plaquemine culture]] period begins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

The '''Dominican Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Dominicano}}, PD) was the ''[[de facto]]'' [[One-party state|only political party]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] during the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], who ruled the country from 1930 to 1961. Its symbol was a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]].

== History ==
The Dominican Party was founded on 2 August 1931, a year after Trujillo came to power. It was an outgrowth of the "Patriotic Coalition of Citizens" that supported Trujillo's run for president. Soon afterward, it was proclaimed to be the only legal party.

On 16 August 1935, the HIN radio station, known as "The Voice of the Dominican Party", was opened. It was dedicated to serving as the media propagator of the activities of the Dominican Party.

The insignia of the Party had a motto that coincided with Trujillo's initials:

*'''R'''ectitud (Righteousness) = Rafael
*'''L'''ibertad (Freedom; Liberty) = Leonidas
*'''T'''rabajo (Work; Labour; Job) = Trujillo.

Later, he added: '''M'''oralidad (Morality) = Molina.

Officially, Trujillo was only president from 1930 until 1938 and from 1942 until 1952, and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1953 until 1961.  However, for 30 years he held the real power as leader of the Dominican Party and [[Generalissimo]] of the [[Dominican Army]]. In these roles, he was able to ensure that when he was not actually president, the position was held by family members or politicians allied to him: [[Jacinto Peynado]] (President from 1938 until 1940), [[Manuel de Jesús Troncoso de la Concha]] (President from 1940 until 1942), his brother [[Héctor Trujillo|Hector]] (President from 1952 until 1960), and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (took office as president in 1960; was president at the time of Trujillo's death). In this way, for the 31 years of his rule, he was able to maintain all governing power in the nation while appearing to be honorable and only hold power for 18 years.

All adult citizens of the Dominican Republic were required to be members of the party. They needed to carry "[the] three strikes" ({{lang-es|"los tres golpes"}})

*Personal Identity Card
*Compulsory Military Service Card
*Dominican Party Membership Card, popularly known as "La Palmita"

The party had no real ideology other than support for Trujillo.  It lingered for a brief time after Trujillo's assassination in 1961.  However, it was apparent there was no place for the party in the more open society, and it was finally wound up in January 1962.

At various times, Trujillo allowed other political parties to coexist.  However, this was done only to impress foreign observers that democratization was progressing, and to allow Trujillo to monitor opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crassweller RD |title=Trujillo.

The '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, with the [[Renaissance]] period, and with the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492, but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to the East]] in 1498), and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.

Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Jan De Vries,  "The limits of globalization in the early modern world." ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of [[the Americas]] and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The [[historical power]]s became involved in global trade, as the exchange of goods, plants, animals, and food crops extended to the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. The [[Columbian Exchange]] greatly affected the human environment.

New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the early modern period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]]. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. The [[European colonialism|European colonization]] of the Americas, Asia, and Africa occurred during the 15th to 19th centuries, and [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread Christianity]] around the world.

The early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, while the period also included the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], the [[European colonization of the Americas]], and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].

By the 16th century the economy under the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]].

Other notable trends of the early modern period include the development of experimental science, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the "late modern"  period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780–1914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese dynasties ===
[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]
Around the beginning of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368—1644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1296937594?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind China's lag in advancement has speculated by many scholars. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists who would break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.&lt;ref&gt;Bala, Arun. ''The Dialogue of Civilizations in the Birth of Modern Science''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=308211#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inventing gunpowder in the 9th century, it was in Europe that the classic handheld firearms, matchlocks, were invented, with evidence of use around the 1480s. China was using the matchlocks by 1540, after the Portuguese brought their matchlocks to Japan in the early 1500s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Andrade, Tonio. ''The Gunpowder Age: China, Military Innovation, and the Rise of the West in World History'', 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=4089513#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; China during the Ming Dynasty established a bureau to maintain its calendar. The bureau was necessary because the calendars were linked to celestial phenomena and that needs regular maintenance because twelve lunar months have 344 or 355 days, so occasional leap months have to be added in order to maintain 365 days per year.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''On their own terms: science in China, 1550-1900''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2005. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3300298#&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, D. O., &amp; Giraldez, A. (1995). Arbitrage, china and world trade in the early modern period. ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 38'', 429. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1304349602?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The silver imports helped fill the void left by the broken paper money system, which helps explain why the value of silver in China was twice as high as the value of silver in Spain during the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. ''ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.31038.0001.001&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ming Dynasty suffered an economic collapse in the seventeenth-century because of heavy inflation of silver, and the European trade depression of the 1620s. The economy sunk to the point where all of China's trading partner cut ties with them: [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] restricted shipments of exports from [[Acapulco]], the Japanese cut off all trade with [[Macau]], and the Dutch severed connections between [[Gao]] and Macau.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, F. E. (1986). China and the seventeenth-century crisis. ''Late Imperial China, 7''(1), 1. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1308082978?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.

The Ming Dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Qing Dynasty]], the last ruling [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917). During its reign, the Qing Dynasty became highly integrated with [[Chinese culture]].

=== Japanese shogunates ===
Following contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] on [[Tanegashima]] Isle in 1543, the Japanese adopted several of the technologies and cultural practices of their visitors, whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), decorative art, language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the Portuguese introduced [[tempura]] and valuable refined sugar.

The [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] saw the political unification that preceded the establishment of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, shōgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section "Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568–1600)" by George Elison, in the entry for "history of Japan".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).

=== Korean dynasty ===
In 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392–1910) with a largely bloodless coup. Yi Seong-gye moved the capital of Korea to the location of modern-day Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. (2014, Mar 21). Honoring the joseon dynasty. ''The Wall Street Journal Asia''Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1508838378?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dynasty was heavily influenced by Confucianism, which also played a large role to shaping Korea's strong cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, Apr 15). Joseon: Korea's confucian kingdom (1). ''The Korea Times'' Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/docview/1990220190?accountid=14523&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tae-gyu, K. (2012, May 29).

During the end of the 16th century, Korea was invaded twice by Japan, first in 1592 and again in 1597. Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by the Manchurian, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubine to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.

== Indian Empires ==
[[File:Moghol.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Mughal Empire]]]]
On the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase. The dynasty founded by [[Bahlul Lodi]] ruled from 1451 to 1526. The dynasty's last ruler, Ibrahim Lodhi, was defeated and killed by [[Babur]] in the first [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]].

The [[Vijayanagara Empire]] was based in the [[Deccan Plateau]], but its power was diminished after a major military defeat in 1565 by the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]].

The rise of the [[Mughal Empire|Great Mughal Empire]] is usually dated from 1526, around the end of the Middle Ages. It was an [[Islamic state|Islamic]] [[Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=L.

=== The Ottoman Empire ===
{{main|Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman ancien régime}}
[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|Ottoman Empire 1481–1683]]

During the early modern era, the [[Ottoman state]] enjoyed an [[growth of the Ottoman Empire|expansion and consolidation]] of power, leading to a ''[[Pax Ottomana]]''. This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.

=== North and Northeast Africa ===
In the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].

[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]

In the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652–1815)}}

The [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].

=== Safavids ===
{{Main|Safavid Empire}}
The [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.

What fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.

=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===
{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}
In the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.

The lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="US State Dept"&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]]. Pashtun forces also invaded Persia, and the opposing forces were defeated in [[the Battle of Gulnabad]]. The Pashtuns later formed the [[Durrani Empire]].

This era in [[Western Europe]] is referred to as the [[early modern Europe]]an period and includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Age of Discovery]] and the beginning of [[European colonialism]], the rise of strong centralized governments, the beginnings of recognizable [[nation-state]]s that are the direct antecedents of today's states, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and from the associated [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific advances]] the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The emergence of cultural and political dominance of the [[Western world]] during this period is known as the [[Great Divergence]].

The early modern period is taken to end with the [[French Revolution]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]].
At the end of the early modern period, the [[Second British Empire|British]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] empires had emerged as world powers from the multipolar contest of [[colonial empires]], while the three great [[Asia]]n empires of the early modern period, [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], [[Mughal Empire#Decline|Mughal India]] and [[Qing China#Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors|Qing China]], all entered a period of stagnation or decline.

=== Renaissance and "early modern" ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
The expression "early modern" is at times incorrectly used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]]. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe — especially central and northern [[Italy]] — and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term 'early modern' is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].

==== Gunpowder and Firearms ====
When gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.

=== European kingdoms and movements ===
In the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.

The [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.

==== Notable individuals ====
[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].&lt;/ref&gt; His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].

Among the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,&lt;ref&gt;The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way—Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212–213&lt;/ref&gt; he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit — a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].

[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufchâteau, Vosges|Neufchâteau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Condé|Condé]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].

The [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the "Iron Duke" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Black Legend]].

In England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

=== Christians and Christendom ===
{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}

Christianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].

==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====
[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]

The [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.

The last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having "decided the fate of [[Christendom]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.

Nearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the "One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.

==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====
{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}

The modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition – Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],&lt;ref&gt;this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective — combating heresy — the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).

The [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-Five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.

On 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-Five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.&lt;ref name="Simon-120-121"&gt;{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=120–121 |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=0-662-27820-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.

The [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.

Of the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:&lt;ref name="fordhaminquisition" /&gt;
# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536–1821)
# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 – c.1860)
This Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].

The [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.

==== Tsardom of Russia ====
{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}

In development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the "Awesome"&lt;ref&gt;Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: "But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', "Ivan the Magnificent" or "Ivan the Awesome," is precisely a man who has become a legend"&lt;/ref&gt; or "the Terrible") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] ("[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562–604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].

=== Discovery and trade ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]
The [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.

The search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.

==== Mercantile capitalism ====
{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}

[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.

The [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.

===== Trade and the New Economy =====
In the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.

In terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

When the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.

===== Piracy's Golden Age =====
{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}

The [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650–1680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.

==== European states and politics ====
The 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".&lt;ref&gt;BBC Science &amp; Nature, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC History, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabrück]] and [[Münster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.

===== Absolutism =====
The [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].

===== French power =====
For much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s—the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]—and two minor conflicts—the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis believed in the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the Fronde, and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].

Men who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Molière]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[André Le Nôtre|Le Nôtre]].

===== Early English revolutions =====
Before the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.

===== International balance of power =====
The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].

The [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistred the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.

== New World and Americas ==
{{Main|Colonialism|History of colonialism|New World}}
[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974 (Recent history).]]
The term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].

=== Conquest and Americas exploration ===

{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)

=== Colonial Latin America ===
{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}

What is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;José C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],&lt;ref&gt;There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.&lt;/ref&gt; was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called "Ibero-America." Spain called its overseas empire there "The Indies," with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, "Indians," who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).

Initially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial North America ===
{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}

North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.

==Atlantic World==
{{see also|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseemüller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]
A recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.

== Religious trends and philosophy ==
{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}

=== Eastern philosophies ===
Concerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].

=== Muslim world ===
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.

=== Protestant Reformation ===
{{Main|Protestant theology}}

The early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].
The theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').

=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===
{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}
The Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.

Such reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].

New religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.

=== Humanism ===
{{Main|Humanism}}
{{further|Erasmus}}
With the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Budé was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212  ''King's sister—queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492–1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573–4188''; v. 139). Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2009. (2 v.: (xxii, 795 p.) {{ISBN|978-90-04-17760-4}} (v. 1), 9789004177611 (v. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; gathered around her and protected a circle of vernacular poets and writers, including [[Clément Marot]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[François Rabelais]].

=== 17th-century philosophy ===
{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}
The philosophy of 17th-century Europe marks the departure from medieval [[scholasticism]] and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]].
The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.

[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

The first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) were philosophers sparking the Age of Enlightenment in the following century.

=== Age of Reason and the scientific revolution ===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment|Scientific revolution|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}
The [[Great Divergence]] is epitomized by the ''Age of Enlightenment'' (or ''Age of Reason'').
The Enlightenment, starting in the 1750s, flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.

The centre of the Enlightenment was France, where it was based in the salons and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].

The French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.

== End of early period ==

[[File:Leonhard Euler World Map AD1760.jpg|thumb|right|Engraved world map (including magnetic declination lines) by [[Leonhard Euler]] from his school atlas “Geographischer Atlas bestehend in 44 Land-Charten” first published 1753 in Berlin]]
In [[modern history]], the end of the early period falls in the late 18th century, as an [[Age of Revolutions]] dawns, beginning with those in North America and France. Subsequent important political changes occurred throughout Europe, including upheavals following the Napoleonic Wars, the redrawing of the map of Europe through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]], the rise of new concepts of nationalism and the reorganization in military forces. The end of the early modern period is usually also associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in the mid-18th century.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnohistory''' is the study of cultures and [[indigenous peoples]]' customs by examining historical records as well as other sources of information on their lives and history. It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not still exist. The term is most commonly used in writing about the [[history of the Americas]].

Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the use of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and placenames.&lt;ref name="Axtell1979"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian's Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3–4 | doi=10.2307/481465| jstor = 481465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
Scholars studying the history of [[Mexico]]'s indigenous have a long tradition, dating back to the colonial era; they used alphabetic texts and other sources to write the history of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]]'', edited by archeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] was involved with creating a multiple volumes on [[Mesoamerican]] ethnohistory, published as ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', appearing in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', volumes 12-16, Howard F. Cline, general editor. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the volumes were published, "both the term 'ethnohistory' and its concepts in the sense used here have entered the literature rather recently and are not fully agreed upon."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 12, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The volumes were intended to be an inventory of sources "which in later hands could utilize to produce professionally acceptable ethnohistory."&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Introduction: Reflections on Ethnohistory", p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 20th century, a number of ethnohistorians of Mexico began to systematically publish many colonial alphabetic texts in indigenous Mexican languages, in a branch of ethnohistory currently known as the [[New Philology]]. That built on an earlier tradition of practitioners writing the [[history of Mexico]] that fully integrated the history of its indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html | title=Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, Provisional Version, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood, editors (2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the field arose out of the study of American Indian communities required by the [[Indian Claims Commission]]. It gained a pragmatic rather than a theoretical orientation, with practitioners testifying both for and against Indian claims. The emerging methodology used documentary historical sources and ethnographic methods. Among the scholars working on the cases was Latin Americanist [[Howard F. Cline]], who was commissioned to work on Florda Indians and [[Jicarilla Apache]].  

The field has also reached into [[Melanesia]], where recent European contact allowed researchers to observe the early postcontact period directly and to address important theoretical questions. [[Michael Harkin]] argues that ethnohistory was part of the general rapprochement between history and anthropology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Harkin, "Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory," ''Social Science History,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 34#2 pp 113-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnohistory grew organically thanks to external nonscholarly pressures, without an overarching figure or conscious plan; even so, it came to engage central issues in cultural and historical analysis. Ethnohistorians take pride in using their special knowledge of specific groups, their linguistic insights, and their interpretation of cultural phenomena. They claim to achieve a more in-depth analysis than the average historian is capable of doing based solely on written documents produced by and for one group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lurie | first1 = N. | year = 1961 | title = Ethnohistory: An Ethnological Point of View | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 83 | doi=10.2307/480349| jstor = 480349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They try to understand culture on its own terms and according to its own cultural code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/482586 | last1 = DeMallie | first1 = Raymond J. | year = 1993 | title = These Have No Ears": Narrative and the Ethnohistorical Method | jstor = 482586| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 515–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnohistory differs from other historically-related [[methodology|methodologies]] in that it embraces [[emic]] perspectives as tools of analysis. The field and its techniques are well suited for writing histories of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples because of its holistic and inclusive framework. It is especially important because of its ability to bridge differing frameworks and access a more informed context for interpretations of the past.

The definition of the field has become more refined over the years. Early on, ethnohistory differed from history proper in that it added a new dimension, specifically "the critical use of ethnological concepts and materials in the examination and use of historical source material," as described by [[William N. Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fenton | first1 = W. N. | year = 1966 | title = Field Work, Museum Studies, and Ethnohistorical Research | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 13 | issue = 1/2| page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[James Axtell]] described ethnohistory as "the use of historical and ethnological methods to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories."&lt;ref name="Axtell1979" /&gt; Others have focused this basic concept on previously ignored historical actors. [[Ed Schieffelin]] asserted, for example, that ethnohistory must fundamentally take into account the people's own sense of how events are constituted, and their ways of culturally constructing the past.&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, E. and D. Gewertz (1985), ''History and Ethnohistory in Papua New Guinea'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Simmons formulated his understanding of ethnohistory as "a form of cultural biography that draws upon as many kinds of testimony as possible over as long a time period as the sources allow." He described ethnohistory as an endeavor based on a [[holistic]], [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] approach that is most rewarding when it can be "joined to the memories and voices of living people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simmons | first1 = W. S. | year = 1988 | title = Culture Theory in Contemporary Ethnohistory | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/2k09f06d| journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 35 | issue = 1| page = 10 | doi=10.2307/482430| jstor = 482430 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting upon the history of ethnohistory as research field in the US, Harkin has situated it within the broader context of convergences and divergences of the fields of history and anthropology and the special circumstances of American Indian land claims and legal history in North American in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1215/01455532-2009-022 | last1 = Harkin | first1 = Michael | year = 2010 | title = Ethnohistory's Ethnohistory: Creating a Discipline from the Ground Up | url = | journal = Social Science History | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 113–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernand Braudel''' ({{IPA-fr|bʁodɛl|lang}}; 24 August 1902 – 27 November 1985) was a French historian  and a leader of the [[Annales School]].  His scholarship focused on three main projects: ''The Mediterranean'' (1923–49, then 1949–66), ''Civilization and Capitalism'' (1955–79), and the unfinished ''Identity of France'' (1970–85). His reputation stems in part from his writings, but even more from his success in making the Annales School the most important engine of historical research in France and much of the world after 1950. As the dominant leader of the Annales School of [[historiography]] in the 1950s and 1960s, he exerted enormous influence on historical writing in France and other countries. He was a student of [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946).

Braudel has been considered one of the greatest of the modern historians who have emphasized the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors in the making and writing of history.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. Fernand Braudel, "The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; He can also be considered as one of the precursors of [[world-systems theory]].

==Biography==
Braudel was born in [[Luméville-en-Ornois]] (as of 1943, merged with and part of [[Gondrecourt-le-Château]]), in the département of the [[Meuse (département)|Meuse]], France.&lt;ref name = "Hughes"&gt;Marine Hughes-Warrington, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', (London: Routledge, 2000), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, who was a natural mathematician, aided him in his studies. Braudel also studied a good deal of Latin and a little Greek. At the age of 7, his family moved to Paris. Braudel was educated at the Lycée Voltaire and the Sorbonne, at which at the age of 20, he was awarded an ''agrégé'' in history. While teaching at the University of Algiers between 1923 and 1932, he became fascinated by the Mediterranean Sea and wrote several papers on the Spanish presence in Algeria in the 16th century. During this time, Braudel began his doctoral thesis on the foreign policy of King [[Philip II of Spain]]. From 1932 to 1935 he taught in the Paris ''lycées'' (secondary schools or high schools) of [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Pasteur]], [[Lycée Condorcet|Condorcet]], and [[Lycée Henri-IV|Henri-IV]].&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;

By 1900, the French solidified their cultural influence in Brazil through the establishment of the Brazilian Academy of Fine Arts. [[São Paulo]] still lacked a university, however, and in 1934 francophile Julio de Mesquita Filho invited anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and Braudel to help establish one. The result was formation of the new [[University of São Paulo]].  Braudel later said that the time in Brazil was the "greatest period of his life."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Skidmore, "Levi-Strauss, Braudel and Brazil: a Case of Mutual Influence." ''Bulletin of Latin American Research'' 2003 22(3): 340–349. {{ISSN|0261-3050}} Full text: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Braudel returned to Paris from Brazil. However, the journey was as significant as arriving at his destination; on his way, he met [[Lucien Febvre]], who was the co-founder of the influential ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale|Annales]]'' journal. The two had booked passage on the same ship.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt; Braudel had started archival research on his doctorate on the Mediterranean when he fell under the influence of the ''Annales'' School around 1938. Also around this time he entered the [[École pratique des hautes études]] as an instructor in history.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt; He worked with Lucien Febvre, who would later read the early versions of Braudel's ''magnum opus'' and provide him with editorial advice.

At the outbreak of war in 1939, he was called up for military service, but was subsequently taken prisoner in 1940 by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt; Braudel was held at a POW camp in [[Mainz]] from 1940 to 1942 before being transferred to a POW camp in [[Lübeck]] where he remained for the rest of the war. While a [[prisoner of war]] in a camp near [[Lübeck]] in Germany, Braudel drafted his great work ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II'' (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II''), without access to his books or notes, but only relying on his prodigious memory and a local library.&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;

Braudel became the leader of the second generation of ''Annales'' historians after 1945. In 1947, with Febvre and Charles Morazé, Braudel obtained funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in New York and founded the noted  [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|Sixième Section]] for "Economic and social sciences" at the [[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]].&lt;ref&gt;He received an additional $1 million from the Ford Foundation in 1960.  Francis X. Sutton, "The Ford Foundation's Transatlantic Role and Purposes, 1951–81." ''Review (Fernand Braudel Center)'' 2001 24(1): 77–104. {{ISSN|0147-9032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 he and Gaston Berger used the Ford Foundation grant and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l'Homme (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death.  It was housed in the building called "Maison des Sciences de l'Homme". FMSH focused its activities on international networking in order to disseminate the ''Annales'' approach to Europe and the world.  In 1972 he gave up all editorial responsibility on the journal, although his name remained on the masthead.

In 1962, he wrote ''A History of Civilizations'' as the basis for a history course, but its rejection of the traditional event-based narrative was too radical for the French ministry of education, which in turn rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mayne, "Translator's Introduction" in Fernand Braudel, ''A History of Civilization,'' (New York:  Penguin Books, 1993), pp. xxvi–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of Braudel's work was his compassion for the suffering of marginal people.&lt;ref&gt;Fernand Braudel, ''A History of Civilizations'', translated by Richard Mayne (New York:  Penguin Books, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; He articulated that most surviving historical sources come from the literate wealthy classes. He emphasized the importance of the ephemeral lives of slaves, serfs, peasants, and the urban poor, demonstrating their contributions to the wealth and power of their respective masters and societies. His work was often illustrated with contemporary depictions of daily life, rarely with pictures of noblemen or kings.

In 1949 Braudel was elected to the [[Collège de France]] upon Febvre’s retirement. He co-founded the academic journal, ''[[Revue économique]],'' in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revue-economique.fr/ ''Revue économique'' official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, Fernand. "Pour une économie historique." ''Revue économique'', Vol. 1, No. 1 (May, 1950), pp. 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired in 1968. In 1983, he was elected to the [[Académie française]].

==''La Méditerranée''==
His first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.

For Braudel there is no single Mediterranean Sea. There are many seas—indeed a "vast, complex expanse" within which men operate. Life is conducted on the Mediterranean: people travel, fish, fight wars, and drown in its various contexts. And the sea articulates with the plains and islands. Life on the plains is diverse and complex; the poorer south is affected by religious diversity (Catholicism and Islam), as well as by intrusions – both cultural and economic – from the wealthier north. In other words, the Mediterranean cannot be understood independently from what is exterior to it. Any rigid adherence to boundaries falsifies the situation.

The first level of time, geographical time, is that of the environment, with its slow, almost imperceptible change, its repetition and cycles. Such change may be slow, but it is irresistible. The second level of time comprises long-term social, economic, and cultural history, where Braudel discusses the Mediterranean economy, social groupings, empires and civilizations. Change at this level is much more rapid than that of the environment; Braudel looks at two or three centuries in order to spot a particular pattern, such as the rise and fall of various aristocracies. The third level of time is that of events (''histoire événementielle''). This is the history of individuals with names. This, for Braudel, is the time of surfaces and deceptive effects. It is the time of the "''courte durée''" proper and it is the focus of Part 3 of ''The Mediterranean'' which treats of "events, politics and people."

Braudel's Mediterranean is centered on the sea, but just as important, it is also the desert and the mountains. The desert creates a nomadic form of social organization where the whole community moves; mountain life is sedentary. Transhumance — that is, the movement from the mountain to the plain, or vice versa in a given season — is also a persistent part of Mediterranean existence.

Braudel's vast, panoramic view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the ''[[longue durée]]'', and downplayed the importance of specific events. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book firmly launched the study of the Mediterranean and dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the ''[[Annales School]].''

==Capitalism==

After ''La Méditerranée'', Braudel's most famous work is ''Civilisation Matérielle, Économie et Capitalisme, XV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;-XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' (''[[Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century]]''). The first volume was published in 1967, and was translated to English in 1973. The last of the three-volume work appeared in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Heston, "Review Essay on Fernand Braudel's Civilization and Capitalism", EH.net, {{cite web |url=http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/heston |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002162406/http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/heston |archivedate=2009-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is a broad-scale history of the pre-industrial modern world, presented in the minute detail demanded by the methodological school called [[cliometrics]], and focusing on how regular people made economies work. Like all Braudel's major works, the book mixed traditional economic material with [[thick description]] of the social impact of economic events on various facets of everyday life, including [[food]], [[fashion]], and other [[social custom]]s. The third volume, subtitled "The Perspective of the World", was strongly influenced by the work of German scholars like [[Werner Sombart]]. In this volume, Braudel traced the impact of the centers of Western capitalism on the rest of the world. Braudel wrote the series both as a way of explanation for the modern way and partly as a refutation of the Marxist view of history.&lt;ref name ="Lewis"&gt;Gwynne Lewis, "Braudel, Fernand," in ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', edited by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: FitzRoy Dearborn, 1999) 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braudel discussed the idea of long-term cycles in the [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]] that he saw developing in Europe in the 12th century. Particular cities, and later nation-states, follow each other sequentially as centers of these cycles: [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]] in the 13th through the 15th centuries (1250–1510); [[Antwerp]] in the 16th century (1500–1569); [[Amsterdam]] in the 16th through 18th centuries (1570–1733); and London (and England) in the 18th and 19th centuries (1733–1896). He used the word "structures" to denote a variety of [[social structures]], such as organized behaviours, attitudes, and conventions, as well as physical structures and infrastructures. He argued that the structures established in Europe during the Middle Ages contributed to the successes of present-day European-based cultures. He attributed much of this to the long-standing independence of city-states, which, though later subjugated by larger geographic states, were not always completely suppressed—probably for reasons of utility.

Braudel argued that capitalists have typically been monopolists and not, as is usually assumed, entrepreneurs operating in competitive markets. He argued that capitalists did not specialize and did not use free markets, thus diverging from both liberal ([[Adam Smith]]) and [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] interpretations. In Braudel's view, the state in capitalist countries has served as a guarantor of monopolists rather than a protector of competition, as it is usually portrayed. He asserted that capitalists have had power and cunning on their side as they have arrayed themselves against the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Immanuel |last=Wallerstein |title=Braudel on Capitalism, or Everything Upside Down |journal=Journal of Modern History |year=1991 |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=354–361 |issn=0022-2801 |doi= 10.1086/244319|jstor=2938489 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that an agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the Braudelian understanding of the concept. On a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional, social, cultural and historical factors than on the state’s undertaken activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agrojournal.org/20/05-03.pdf M. Pietrzak, D. Walczak, The Analysis of the Agrarian Structure in Poland with the Special Consideration of the Years 1921 and 2002, Bulgarian Journal of Agricultural Science, Vol 20, No 5, pp. 1025, 1038.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''L'Identité de la France''==
Braudel's last and most personal book was ''L'Identité de la France'' (''The Identity of France''), which was unfinished at the time of his death in 1985.&lt;ref name ="Lewis" /&gt; Unlike many of Braudel's other books, he made no secret of his profound love of his country,  remarking at the beginning that he had loved France as if she were a woman. Reflecting his interest with the ''longue durée'', Braudel's concern in ''L'Identité de la France'' was with the centuries and millennia instead of the years and decades. Braudel argued that France was the product not of its politics or economics but rather of its geography and culture, a thesis Braudel explored in a wide-ranging book that saw the ''bourg'' and the ''patois: historie totale'' integrated into a broad sweep of both the place and the time. Unlike Braudel's other books, ''L'Identité de la France'' was much colored by a romantic nostalgia, as Braudel argued for the existence of [[France profonde|''la France profonde'']], a "deep France" based upon the peasant ''mentalité'' that despite all of the turmoil of French history and the Industrial Revolution had survived intact right up to the present.&lt;ref name ="Lewis" /&gt;

==Historiography==

According to Braudel, before the ''Annales'' approach, the writing of history was focused on the ''courte durée'' (short span), or on ''histoire événementielle'' (a history of events).

His followers admired his use of the ''longue durée'' approach to stress the slow and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.&lt;ref&gt;See Wallerstein, "Time and Duration" (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and massive political upheavals in France, were very uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the ''longue durée'', arguing that the continuities in the deepest structures of society were central to history. Upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history, they argued, lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]&lt;/ref&gt; A proponent of historical materialism, Braudel rejected Marxist materialism, stressing the equal importance of infrastructure and superstructure, both of which reflected enduring social, economic, and cultural realities.  Braudel's structures, both mental and environmental, determine the long-term course of events by constraining actions on, and by, humans over a duration long enough that they are beyond the consciousness of the actors involved.

'''''From Atlantis to the Sphinx''''' is a work of non-fiction by British author, [[Colin Wilson]], with the subheading  ''Recovering the Lost Wisdom of the Ancient World''.

Wilson proposes in the text that the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] was constructed by a technologically advanced people "nearly 10,000 years before [[Egyptologists]] have hypothesized" by the same people who provided plans for the construction of the pyramids of Egypt, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Central]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67741948.html|title = Book Thickens the Riddle of the Sphinx|last = Graham|first = Mark|date = 6 November 1997|work = [[Rocky Mt. News|Rocky Mountain News]]|access-date = 2015-08-02|via = [[Highbeam Research]]|location = Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book explores the connection between [[astronomy]] and [[mythology]], arguing that ancient man used "Lunar knowledge" (intuition) as opposed to modern man's "Solar knowledge" (logic) to interpret the universe and therefore possessed an entirely different but equally valid mentality from that of modern man. Wilson proposes that the outlook of ancient man was based on "seeing the big picture" rather than logically breaking down the universe into its constituent parts.

Wilson develops this idea of civilisations founded on Lunar Knowledge together with astronomy to explain the monumental and seemingly spontaneous achievements of ancient cultures such as the [[Pyramids of Giza|Pyramid Complex]] at [[Giza]] in Egypt.

Wilson argues that the essential weakness of [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' is that Frazer attributed the fundamental mythological systems to the beginnings of the farming cultures, specifically to fertility. Agreeing with [[Giorgio de Santillana]]'s thesis developed in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'', Wilson places the genesis of mythology previous to fertility cultures, linking the fundamental myths to astronomical occurrences such as the [[Precession of the Equinoxes]].

The main observations drawn by Wilson are that our ancient pre-''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ancestors possessed intelligence equal to that of modern man, their apparent lack of technological achievement being explained by the needlessness of it based on their completely different, intuitive and all-embracing mentality. Over time, a more logical and dissecting mentality evolved leading to the traits which mark modern civilisations.

{{History of Australia}}
The '''history wars''' in Australia are an ongoing public debate over the interpretation of the history of the [[Australian history#British settlement and colonisation|British colonisation of Australia]] and development of contemporary Australian society (particularly with regard to the impact on [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]]).

The Australian debate often concerns the extent to which the history of European colonisation post-1788 and government administration since Federation in 1901 may be characterised as having been:

*a relatively minor conflict between European colonists and [[Indigenous Australians]], and generally lacking in events that might be termed 'invasion', 'warfare', '[[guerrilla warfare]]', 'conquest' or '[[genocide]]', and generally marked instead by humane intent by government authorities, with damage to indigenous people largely attributable to unintended factors (such as the spread of new diseases) rather than to malicious policies; or
*an invasion marked by violent conflict at the frontier, guerrilla warfare (or other forms of [[warfare]]) between Europeans and Aboriginal people, involving frequent or significant massacres of Aboriginal peoples engaged in defending their traditional tribal lands; a situation which can be said to have developed either nationally, or in certain areas, into something like a war of 'extermination' or something which accords with the term genocide as a consequence of British [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] involving continued dispossession, [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], ill treatment and [[cultural genocide]].

The history wars also relates to broader themes concerning [[national identity]], as well as [[Historiography|methodological questions]] concerning the historian and the craft of researching and writing history, including issues such as the value and reliability of written records (of the authorities and settlers) and the [[oral tradition]] (of the Indigenous Australians), along with the political or similar [[ideological]] biases of those who interpret them.  One theme is how British or multicultural Australian identity has been in history and today.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Meaney,  "Britishness and Australian identity: The problem of nationalism in Australian history and historiography," ''Australian Historical Studies''  32.116 (2001): 76-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Gare, "Britishness in recent Australian historiography." ''Historical Journal'' 43#4 (2000): 1145-1155.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time the history wars were in play, professional history seemed in decline, and popular writers began reclaiming the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Drusilla Modjeska|title=The Best Australian Essays 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UBV5f0LThoC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|pages=100–1|isbn=9781863952781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
{{outdated section|date=August 2016}} 
In 1968 Professor [[Bill Stanner|W. E. H. "Bill" Stanner]], an Australian [[anthropology|anthropologist]], coined the term the "Great Australian Silence" in a [[Boyer Lectures|Boyer Lecture]] entitled "After the Dreaming",&lt;ref name=Stanner-198-248&gt;Stanner pp. 198-248&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued that the writing of [[History of Australia|Australian history]] was incomplete. He asserted that Australian national history as documented up to that point had largely been presented in a positive light, but that [[Indigenous Australians]] had been virtually ignored. He saw this as a structural and deliberate process to omit "several hundred thousand Aboriginal people who lived and died between 1788 and 1938 ... (who were but) ... negative facts of history and ... were in no way consequential for the modern period".&lt;ref&gt;Stanner, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A new strand of Australian [[historiography]] subsequently emerged which gave much greater attention to the negative experiences of Indigenous Australians during the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|British settlement of Australia]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, historians such as [[Manning Clark]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] published work which they saw as correcting a selective historiography that had misrepresented or ignored Indigenous Australian history.  The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argued in the literary and political journal ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' in 1993 that the telling of Australian history had moved from an unduly positive rendition (the "Three Cheers View") to an unduly negative view (The "[[#Black armband debate|'black armband']]") and Australian commentators and politicians have continued to debate this subject.

Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the ''[[#History wars and culture wars|'culture wars']]'' during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government from 1996–2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with ''Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt; [http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/node/1293 [[Robert Manne]], "What is Rudd’s Agenda?", ''[[The Monthly]]'', November 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into a [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|controversy]] over the way history was presented in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in [[high school]] history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guy Rundle writes: |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title=1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern – Crikey |publisher=Crikey.com.au |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justine Ferrari, Education writer |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title=History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major [[broadsheet]]s such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn. ''Journal of Visual Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 1, 86-88 (2006) {{doi|10.1177/147041290600500107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an 'intellectual dead end'.&lt;ref name="Langton" &gt;Langton M. Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show.  ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the "wars". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Dr Mark McKenna,&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=M. McKenna, (1997). "Different Perspectives on Black Armband History: Research Paper 5 1997-98". Parliament of Australia: Parliamentary Library |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Keating]] (1991–1996) was believed by [[John Howard]] (1996–2007) to portray Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the Monarchy and the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the Conservative Australian Parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 [[Bringing Them Home]] Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aboriginal people as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under [Thinking Faith - the online journal of the British Jesuits&amp;#93; |publisher=Thinkingfaith.org |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt" and said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]], the [[Australian Flag]] and the [[Monarchy in Australia]], while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Kim Beazley]], Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that "Political Correctness" was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities"; and in 2006, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' Political Editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars ... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title=PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= 28 October 2006|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]] altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title=Full text of Australia's apology to Aboriginal people |publisher=CNN.com |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html |title=Brendan Nelson's sorry speech - National |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127074319/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html |archivedate=27 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian Republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of [[ANZAC Day]] and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120912154538/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-12 |title=Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |publisher=The Australian |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title=Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 October 2004 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the change of government and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title=End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher=Blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archivedate=9 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22908896-7583,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212124342/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C22908896-7583%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2007 |title=The Australian |date=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an intention to reengage in the history wars was indicated by then-Federal Opposition member [[Christopher Pyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Baird |url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH130427114V71OBPNC |title=Don't dismiss nation's blemishes |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2013-04-27 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black armband / white blindfold debate==
The black armband debate concerns whether or not accounts of Australian history gravitate towards an overly negative or an overly positive point of view. The ''black armband view of [[History of Australia|history]]'' was a phrase first used by Australian [[historian]] [[Geoffrey Blainey]] in his 1993 ''Sir [[John Latham (jurist)|John Latham]] Memorial Lecture'' to describe views of history which, he believed, posited that "much of [pre-multicultural] Australian history had been a disgrace" and which focused mainly on the treatment of minority groups (especially Aboriginal people). This he contrasted with the '' 'Three Cheers' '' view, according to which: "nearly everything that came after [the convict era] was believed to be pretty good". Blainey argued that both such accounts of Australian history were inaccurate: "The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm M. McKenna, (10 November 1997), Research Paper 5 1997-98: "Different Perspectives on Black Armband History, Parliament of Australia, Parliamentary Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RP/1997-98/98rp05.htm |date=4 April 2009 }} "To some extent my generation was reared on the Three Cheers view of history. This patriotic view of our past had a long run. It saw Australian history as largely a success. While the convict era was a source of shame or unease, nearly everything that came after was believed to be pretty good. There is a rival view, which I call the Black Armband view of history. In recent years it has assailed the optimistic view of history. The black armbands were quietly worn in official circles in 1988. The multicultural folk busily preached their message that until they arrived much of Australian history was a disgrace. The past treatment of Aboriginal people, of Chinese, of Kanakas, of non-British migrants, of women, the very old, the very young, and the poor was singled out, sometimes legitimately, sometimes not. My friend and undergraduate teacher Manning Clark, who was almost the official historian in 1988, had done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases.

The Black Armband view of history might well represent the swing of the pendulum from a position that had been too favourable, too self congratulatory, to an opposite extreme that is even more unreal and decidedly jaundiced."&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture was subsequently published in the political and literary journal, ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'',&lt;ref name = "QuadrantBlainey1993"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]], 'Drawing Up a Balance Sheet of Our History', in [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]], vol.37 ( 7-8), July/August 1993&lt;/ref&gt; which at the time was edited by [[Robert Manne]] and is now edited by [[Keith Windschuttle]], two of the leading "history warriors", albeit on opposing sides of the debate. The phrase then began to be used by some commentators [[pejorative]]ly to describe historians viewed as writing excessively critical Australian [[history of Australia|history]] "while wearing a black [[armband]]" of "mourning and grieving, or [[shame]]". New interpretations of Australia's history since 1788 were contested for focussing almost exclusively on official and unofficial [[imperialism]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], ill treatment, [[colonialism|colonial]] dispossession and [[cultural genocide]] and ignoring positive aspects of Australia's history.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; [[Manning Clark]] was named by Blainey in his 1993 speech as having "done much to spread the gloomy view and also the compassionate view with his powerful prose and Old Testament phrases".&lt;ref name = "QuadrantBlainey1993"/&gt; &lt;!--this ref given as cited in McKenna--&gt;

The [[Howard Government]]'s responses to the question of how to recount Australian history were initially formulated in the context of [[Paul Keating]]'s characterisation of the subject. [[John Howard]] argued in a 1996 [[Sir Robert Menzies Lecture]] that the "balance sheet of Australian history" had come to be misrepresented:
{{quote|The 'black armband' view of our history reflects a belief that most Australian history since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. ... I believe that the balance sheet of our history is one of heroic achievement and that we have achieved much more as a nation of which we can be proud than of which we should be ashamed. In saying that I do not exclude or ignore specific aspects of our past where we are rightly held to account. Injustices were done in Australia and no-one should obscure or minimise them. ... But ... our priority should ... [be] to commit to a practical program of action that will remove the enduring legacies of disadvantage.&lt;ref name="1996MenziesLecture"&gt;John Howard. [http://www.menzieslecture.org/1996.html The Liberal Tradition: The Beliefs and Values Which Guide the Federal Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727080235/http://www.menzieslecture.org/1996.html |date=27 July 2011 }}, 1996 Sir Robert Menzies Lecture. Sir Robert Menzies Lecture Trust. Retrieved 16 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2009, Howard's successor [[Kevin Rudd]] also called for moving away from a ''black-arm view'':

{{quote|Time to leave behind us the polarisation that began to infect our every discussion of our nation's past. To go beyond the so-called "black arm" view that refused to confront some hard truths about our past, as if our forebears were all men and women of absolute nobility, without spot or blemish. But time, too, to go beyond the view that we should only celebrate the reformers, the renegades and revolutionaries, thus neglecting or even deriding the great stories of our explorers, of our pioneers, and of our entrepreneurs.

[[Stephen Muecke]], currently Professor of Writing at the [[University of New South Wales]], contributed to the debate by arguing that black armband events bring people together in common remembrance and cited [[Anzac Day]] as an example; while Aboriginal lawyer [[Noel Pearson]] argued that whilst there was much that is worth preserving in the cultural heritage of non-Aboriginal Australia, "To say that ordinary Australians who are part of the national community today do not have any connection with the shameful aspects of our past is at odds with our exhortations that they have connections to the prideful bits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm#ORIGINS |title=Australian Parliamentary Library - Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113845/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1997-98/98rp05.htm |archivedate=4 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of the ''{{'}}white blindfold{{'}}'' view of [[History of Australia|history]] entered the debate as a pejorative counter-response to the notion of the "black armband school".&lt;ref name=white-blindfold&gt;[[Anna Clark (historian)|Clark, Anna]].

In his book ''Why Weren't We Told?'' in 1999, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] referred to [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|Stanner]]'s "Great Australian Silence", and to "a 'mental block' which prevented Australians from coming to terms with the past".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds (1999), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the silence about [[Australian frontier wars|Australia's history of frontier violence]] in much of the twentieth century stands in stark contrast with the openness with which violence was admitted and discussed in the nineteenth. Reynolds quotes many excerpts from the press, including an article written in the ''[[Townsville]] Herald'' in Queensland as late as 1907, by a "pioneer" who described his part in a massacre. Reynolds commented that violence against Aboriginals, far from being hushed up or denied, was openly talked about.

The nature of the debate began to change in 1999 with the publication of a book ''Massacre Myth'' by journalist, [[Rod Moran]], who examined the 1926 [[Forrest River massacre]] in Western Australia. Moran concluded that the massacre was a myth inspired by the false claims of a missionary (possibly as a result of mental health issues).&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rod (1999) ''Massacre myth: an investigation into allegations concerning the mass murder of Aboriginal people at Forrest River, 1926'' Bassendean, W.A.

''Quadrant'', 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Windschuttle]], an Australian historian, said that reviewing Moran's book inspired his own examination of the wider historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyline.com/UNSW%20debate.htm |title=The Sydney Line |publisher=The Sydney Line |date=29 May 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223082820/http://www.sydneyline.com/UNSW%20debate.htm |archivedate=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windschuttle argues that much of Australian Aboriginal history, particularly as written since the late 1970s, was based on the use of questionable or unreliable evidence and on deliberate misrepresentation and fabrication of historical evidence. He based his conclusions on his examination of the evidence cited in previous historical accounts and reported incidences of non-existent documents being cited, misquoting and misleadingly selective quoting from documents and of documents being cited as evidence that certain events took place when his examination concluded that they do not support those claims. Windschuttle reported his conclusions in a number of articles published in Quadrant and in 2002, he published a book, ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', Volume 1, Van Diemen’s Land 1803-1847, which focussed on Tasmanian colonial history.

Historian Geoffrey Blainey argued in a 2003 book review of Fabrication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/nativefiction-1774 |title=Native fiction by Geoffrey Blainey |publisher=The New Criterion |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the number of instances when the source documents do not support the claims made and the fact that the divergences overwhelmingly tend to purport claims of violent conflict and massacres indicates that this is not a matter of mere error but bias.

The debate had therefore changed from an argument over whether there was an excessive focus on negative aspects of Australian history to one over to what extent, if at all, Australian Aboriginal history had been based on questionable evidence or had been falsified or fabricated and whether this had exaggerated the extent of violence against Aboriginal people. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include [[Lyndall Ryan]] and [[Henry A. Reynolds|Henry Reynolds]] and the histories of massacres, particularly in [[Tasmania]] but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's naming of historians whom he accused of misrepresentation and fabrication of the historical evidence, created considerable controversy and produced a range of responses including condemnation of as well as support for his work.&lt;ref&gt;Attwood, Bain (2005).

==Genocide debate==&lt;!-- The redirect [[Australian genocide debate]] links to this section--&gt;
{{See also|Genocide definitions}}
The case for using the term "Australian genocide" rests on evidence from various sources that people argue proves some form of genocide. People cite the [[list of massacres of indigenous Australians]] by white settlers, mainly in the 19th century (cf. ''Blood on the Wattle'' by Bruce Elder or ''Frontier History Revisited'' by Robert Orsted-Jensen); only a few massacres were documented, and the evidence is strong that evidence of massacres was generally covered by secrecy and there are powerful signs that documents had been destroyed. Evidence is solid that Queensland's Native Police produced diaries, collision reports and monthly and quarterly enumerations of 'patrols' and 'collisions' with indigenous people, and that all of this material was stored in the Queensland police department. However, not one single sheet of information of this kind which is today available at the Queensland State archive originate from files delivered by the police department, the material left comes solely from other government offices. Only human interference can produce a total loss of the vast Native Police Force records once stored in the Queensland Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;see Orsted-Jensen, R: 'Frontier History Revisited', page 253pp (Appendix B 'The Lost Native Police Reports')&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed to the dramatic reduction in the Tasmanian Aboriginal population in the 19th century and the forced removal of generations of Aboriginal children from their parents during the 20th century as evidence of genocide. The evidence includes documentation of the wish, and sometimes intention, of a significant proportion of late 19th-century and early 20th-century white Australians to see the Aboriginal "race" eliminated. Documents include published letters to the editors of high-circulation newspapers. Certainly this was the case in Queensland, in terms of indigenous people the most populated section of Australia and certainly the colony with the most violent frontier. In June 1866 Sir [[Robert Herbert]] summing up his experience after little more than five years as the first Premier of this colony wrote:

{{quote|Every method of dealing with these very dangerous savages has been tried, and I believe no more satisfactory system can be devised than that under which the people of Queensland endeavour to deal with a difficulty which it is feared can never terminate except with the gradual disappearance of the unimprovable race.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Knox: ''The Queensland Years of Robert Herbert, Premier'' St Lucia QUP 1977, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mentioned "system", for which Herbert was among the people personal responsible, was the so-called "[[Native Police]] system" which typically went about "dispersing" any sign of indigenous resistance at the frontier by use of deadly early morning attacks on Aboriginal camps. This semi-military force was allowed to go about its business, typically instigating large scale deadly retaliation without prior investigating of alleged crime. They generally took no prisoners at the frontier and there are no signs that they ever enforced any other "law" than "might is right". It was a force designed more in the manner of the recent times phenomenon known as the "death-squad" and the secrecy of its operations was ensured by the remoteness of its operations, added a system that denied the evidence from "blacks" while the force itself was instructed to ensure that there would always be only one white witness, the officer in charge of each detachment. Recently the first ever attempt to scientifically calculate the amount of Aboriginal people killed in encounters with the Native Police indicates that numbers may exceed 45,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Evans, Raymond &amp; Ørsted–Jensen, Robert: 'I Cannot Say the Numbers that Were Killed': Assessing Violent Mortality on the Queensland Frontier" (paper at AHA 9 July 2014 at University of Queensland) publisher Social Science Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "useless race" was commonly expressed in Queensland such as in 1877 when an editorial in the leading journal noted that,

{{quote|The desire for progressive advancement and substantial prosperity is, after all, stronger than sentimental dislike to the extinction of a savage and useless race.&lt;ref&gt;Queenslander 7 October 1876, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Classifying Aboriginal people as a useless or unimprovable race was common. Comprehensively debating the native police and the frontier in public in 1880 in the columns of the ''Queenslander'' (the weekly edition of the colony's leading journal), one could read the following statements from yet another prominent settler,

{{quote|And being a useless race, what does it matter what they suffer any more than the distinguished philanthropist who writes in this behalf cares for the wounded half dead pigeon he tortures at his shooting matches.&lt;ref&gt;''Queenslander'' 8 May 1880, page 594-95&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Remarks which were followed up in October of that years by [[Boyd Dunlop Morehead]], one of the leading landholders, manager of the Scottish Australian Investment Co.'s ''Bowen Downs'' in 1866-81 and a future Premier, could be heard making the following acknowledgement in a parliamentary speech, saying, yes settlers in the past did go

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;out, and in their pioneering had, of necessity, to use extreme measures to the inhabitants of the soil. The aboriginal, no doubt, had been shot down; no one denied it ... this race was being worked off the face of the earth. That that was so everyone knew, and that it must be so, none would deny ... For his own part he did not believe that the aboriginal race was worth preserving. If there were no aboriginals it would be a very good thing&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly on 21 October 1880, speech by the member for Mitchell, grazier, businessman, later Premier &amp; Colonial Secretary of Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the introduction of the word "genocide" in the 1940s by [[Raphael Lemkin]], Lemkin himself and most comparative scholars of genocide and many general historians, such as [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], [[Ward Churchill]], [[Leo Kuper]] and [[Jared Diamond]], basing their analysis on previously published histories, present the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people as a text book example of a genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reynolds, "Genocide in Tasmania?", in A. Dirk Moses (ed.) ''Genocide and settler society: frontier violence and stolen indigenous children in Australian history'', Berghahn Books, 2004 p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian historian of genocide, [[Ben Kiernan]], in his recent history of the concept and practice, ''Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur'' (2007), treats the Australian evidence over the first century of colonization as an example of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kiernan, "Genocidal Violence in Nineteenth-Century Australia", in his ''Blood and soil: a world history of genocide and extermination from Sparta to Darfur'' Yale University Press, 2007, pp. 249-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among scholars specializing in Australian history much recent debate has focused on whether indeed what happened to groups of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people, and especially the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal people]], during the European colonisation of Australia can be classified as genocide. According to Mark Levene, most Australian experts are now "considerably more circumspect".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Levene, ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation State: The rise of the West and the coming of genocide'', I.

Tauris, 2005 {{ISBN|1-84511-057-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84511-057-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3PsLXeDflfMC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=tasmania+genocide+Reynolds&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 p.344 footnote 105]&lt;/ref&gt; In the specific instance of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]], who takes events in other regions of colonial Australia as marked by "genocidal moments",&lt;ref&gt;Henry Reynolds, ''The Question of Genocide in Australia's History'' (2001), cited in Ann Curthoys, ''Genocide in Tasmania: The History of an Idea'', in A.

However, in practice the events on the ground that lead to their virtual extinction worked out.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5zHAGNPTkqIC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=Tasmanian+Genocide Henry Reynolds, "Genocide in Tasmania?"] in A.

While calling for "a more robust exchange between genocide and Tasmanian historical scholarship",{{sfn|Curthoys|2008|p=247}} her own view is that the Tasmanian instance constitutes a "case for genocide, though not of state planning, mass killing, or extinction".{{sfn|Curthoys|2008|p=230}}

Much of the debate on whether European colonisation of Australia resulted in genocide, centres on whether "the term 'genocide' only applies to cases of deliberate mass killings of Aboriginal people by European settlers, or ... might also apply to instances in which many Aboriginal people were killed by the reckless or unintended actions and omissions of settlers".&lt;ref name=Australian-debate-on-genocide&gt;[http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page#arti "Debates on Genocide - Part One Debates on 'Genocide' in Australian History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112193203/http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page |date=12 January 2016 }}, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training&lt;/ref&gt; Historians such as Tony Barta argue that for the victim group it matters little if they were wiped out as part of a planned attack.

[[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] points out that European colonists and their descendants frequently use expressions that included "extermination", "extinction", and "extirpation" when discussing the treatment of Aboriginal people during the colonial period, and as in his opinion genocide "can take many forms, not all of them violent".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page#arti "Debates on Genocide - Part One Debates on "Genocide" in Australian History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112193203/http://www.hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&amp;Itemid=364&amp;op=page |date=12 January 2016 }}, Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training. citing Reynolds, ''An Indelible Stain?

== Controversy over smallpox in Australia ==

The arrival of [[smallpox]] in Australia is of uncertain origin and is a major theme in the history wars. The lack of immunity among Aboriginal Australians to this introduced disease saw it inflict a devastating toll on the Aboriginal population. Though the [[First Fleet]] itself did not arrive with any known carriers of the disease, the observation of an epidemic among the Aboriginal population of Sydney around 16 months after the British arrived has led to speculation that the Fleet itself brought this disease to Australia. Some historians have suggested that the disease may have been either released by accident or theft of medicine stores or perhaps been deliberately employed as a form of "[[germ warfare]]" against indigenous Australians. [[Inoculation]] was thus commonly practised by surgeons decades before 1796 and the process of [[smallpox vaccination]] was introduced by [[Edward Jenner]]. Dried scab was commonly stored in glass containers as part of a surgeons remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin, Noel: ''Our Original Aggression'', Sydney 1983, p19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early speculation on the origins of the disease is recorded in the writing of a [[First Fleet]] Captain of Marines, [[Watkin Tench]], who noted an "extraordinary calamity" among the Aboriginal people of Sydney, beginning in April 1789. Repeated accounts of dead bodies marked with pustules consistent with smallpox began being reported around [[Sydney Harbour]] around this time. Tench wrote that the colonists' observations had led them to suppose that smallpox was not known in [[New South Wales]] and as no [[First Fleet]]ers had suffered from the disease, its sudden existence among the Aboriginal people was "inexplicable". Tench speculated as to whether the disease might be indigenous to the country; or whether it had been brought to the colony by the French expedition of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Lapérouse]] a year before; traversed the continent from the West where Europeans had previously landed; brought by expedition of [[James Cook]]; or indeed by the first British settlers at Sydney. "Our surgeons brought out varioulous matter in bottles", he wrote, "but to infer that it was produced from this cause were a supposition so wild as to be unworthy of consideration".&lt;ref&gt;Watkin Tench; ''1788: Edited and Introduced by Tim Flannery"; The Text Publishing Company; Melbourne; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, and despite the lack of certainty over how or when the disease reached Australia, there has been a history war regarding the way that smallpox arrived in Australia, especially whether it was deliberately used as a crude [[biological weapon]] against indigenous peoples.

Medical scientists such as Sir [[Edward Stirling]] and Sir [[John Burton Cleland|John Cleland]] published a number of books and articles between 1911 and 1966 suggesting that smallpox arrived in Northern Australia from an Asian source.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

A rival theory, that smallpox was introduced to NSW in 1789 by British settlers, was put forward in 1914 by the director of the [[Australian Quarantine Service]], Dr [[John Cumpston|J.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;L. Cumpston]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1908"&gt;Cumpston, JHL "The History of Small-Pox in Australia 1788–1908", Government Printer (1914) Melb.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Professor [[Noel Butlin]], an economic historian, suggested: "it is possible and, in 1789, likely, that infection of the Aboriginal people was a deliberate extermination act". Historians David Day and Henry Reynolds repeated Butlin’s claims and in 2001 Reynolds wrote: "one possibility is that the epidemic was deliberately or accidentally let loose by someone in the settlement at Sydney Cove. Not surprisingly this is a highly contentious proposition. If true, it would clearly fall within the ambit of the Genocide Convention".&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, published by Allen &amp; Unwin, 2006, p125.&lt;/ref&gt; Butlin argued that while Macassan fishermen could possibly 'have landed the virus on the Australian mainland at some stage their ability to do so was limited'.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: ''Our Original Aggression'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt; It is furthermore highly unlikely, he argued, that this virus should have been brought down from the Gulf of Carpentaria to coincidence with the first major outbreak "just fifteen months after the landing of the first fleet". Besides the time factor connected to Macassans, 'over seven or eight weeks (or more)', the type of vessels, the limited potential for contact between Aboriginal people and fishermen, and the fact of clothing as carrier and virus is destroyed or seriously reduced in contact with salt water, makes the Macassan theory highly unlikely, he argued. Indeed, infected 'Macassans would be either dead or fully recovered long before reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: Our Original Aggression, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas transfer somehow, theft accident or the like, from scab originally stored in glass containers carried by just one of the seven medical officers on the first fleet seems the most likely cause.&lt;ref&gt;Butlin: ''Our Original Aggression'', p.19-20 &amp; 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. C. Macknight|C.&amp;nbsp;C. Macknight]] (1986) an authority on the centuries-old [[Makassar#Contact with Australia|interaction between indigenous Australians and the people of Makassar]] (later part of Indonesia), revived the theory that smallpox was introduced to Australia by [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan mariners visiting Arnhem Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Macknight, C.&amp;nbsp;C. "Macassans and the Aboriginal past" in ''Archaeologia Oceania'' | publication-date=1986 | volume=21 | pages=69–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian virologist [[Frank Fenner]] (1988) – who in 1977–80 led the successful [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) campaign to eradicate smallpox and was the principal author of a 1988 WHO report, ''Smallpox and its Eradication'' – pointed out that no cases of smallpox were reported amongst convicts, sailors, military personnel, or free settlers, on the First Fleet.&lt;ref name= Fenner1/&gt; The virus was also not reported among British or Aboriginal people at Port Jackson over the following 15 months. It was, therefore, unlikely that a person suffering from smallpox and travelling with the First Fleet had caused the 1789 outbreak.

While there were cases of smallpox in Macassar during 1789, there are no reports of it occurring prior to that period. However, [[History of smallpox#Island South East Asia|smallpox had long been present in island South East Asia]] – possibly as early the [[4th century]] according to Frank Fenner.&lt;ref&gt;Fenner, cited by Victor T.

Macassans had contact with these areas both directly and indirectly (through foreign traders and invaders).

[[David Day (historian)|David Day]] (2001) reiterated Butlin's argument and suggested that members of Sydney's garrison of [[Royal Marines]] may have attempted to use smallpox as a biological weapon in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;David Day, ''Claiming a Continent A New History of Australia'', HarperCollins, Sydney, 2001, p. 42f.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, however, John Connor stated that Day's theory was "unsustainable".&lt;ref&gt;John Connor, ''The Australian Frontier Wars, 1788-1838'', UNSW Press, 2002, p29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 book, ''Invisible Invaders'', historian [[Judy Campbell (historian)|Judy Campbell]] &amp;ndash; advised by Fenner &amp;ndash; reviewed reports of disease amongst Aboriginal people from 1780–1880, including the smallpox epidemics of 1789-90, the 1830s and the 1860s. Campbell argues that the evidence, including that contained in these reports shows that, while many diseases such as tuberculosis ''were'' introduced by British colonists, this was not so for smallpox and that the speculations of British responsibility made by other historians were based on tenuous evidence, largely on the mere coincidence that the 1789-90 epidemic was first observed afflicting the Aboriginal people not long after the establishment of the first British settlement. Campbell argues instead that the north-south route of transmission of the 1860s epidemics (which is generally agreed), also applied in the earlier ones. Campbell noted that the fleets of fast Macassan fishing vessels, propelled by monsoonal winds, reached Australia after being at sea for as little as ten to fifteen days, well within the incubation period of smallpox. The numbers of people travelling in the fleets were large enough to sustain smallpox for extended periods of time without it ‘burning out’.  The Macassans spent up to six months fishing along the northern Australian coastline and Aboriginal people had "day-to-day contact with the islanders. Aboriginals visited the praus and the camps the visitors set up on shore, they talked and traded…" &lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; She also notes that Butlin, writing in 1983, "did not recognize that Aboriginals were "great travellers", who spread infection over long distances…." and that smallpox was spread through their extensive social and trading contacts as well as by Aboriginal people fleeing from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 61, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell also cited British historian [[Charles Wilson (historian)|Charles Wilson]], who cited "medical microbiology" in disagreeing with Butlin about the origins of the 1789 outbreak, and "doubted his estimates of its demographic impact", as well as "First Fleet historian [[Alan Frost]] [who] also disagreed with Butlin’s views".&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, p 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Warren]] (2007) claimed that Fenner did not address the issue of [[variolous material]] brought in bottles by the First Fleet, for use as an inoculant.&lt;ref&gt;Warren C., "Could First Fleet smallpox infect Aborigines? - A note", ''Aboriginal History 31'', pp. 152-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Warren argued that, even if the variolous material was degraded, it could still infect susceptible people. Smallpox spread by the inhalation of airborne droplets of virus in situations of personal contact or by contact with blankets, clothing or other objects that an infected person had recently used.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Dr Josephine, ''The Original Australians'', pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;  This material was carried by First Fleet surgeons for inoculation purposes. Warren also suggested that Frost's view was based on a false premise: that the First Fleet's stocks of virus were sterilised by summer heat.

Craig Mear (2008) and Michael J. Bennett (2009) have disputed Campbell's hypothesis that smallpox was introduced to Australia in 1789 through contact between Aboriginal people and mariners from Makassar.&lt;ref&gt;''Invisible Invaders: Smallpox and Other Diseases in Aboriginal Australia 1780 - 1880'', by Judy Campbell, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp. 55, 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Mear, [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2009/2557307.htm The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789].

Hist. Med. 83(1)'', Spring 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. A. Willis]] (2010), in a survey of much of the literature discussed above, reiterated the argument made by Campbell.&lt;ref name="willis 2010"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Willis, H.

Macknight re-entered the debate in 2011, declaring: "The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Macassan] [[Trepanging|trepang]]ers on the north coast and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there."&lt;ref&gt;Macknight, Campbell "The view from Marege’: Australian knowledge of Macassar and the impact of the trepang industry across two centuries " in ''Aboriginal History'' | publication-date=2011 | volume=35 | pages=121–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Carmody, a professor of medicine, put forward an alternative theory (2013) suggesting that the 1789 epidemic may have been [[chickenpox]] rather than smallpox. Carmody pointed out that chickenpox could have taken a severe toll on a population with little hereditary or acquired immunological resistance.  With regard to smallpox, Carmody said: "There is absolutely no evidence to support any of the theories and some of them are fanciful and far-fetched." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/chickenpox-blamed-for-aboriginal-deaths-20130807-2rh3m.html |title=Chickenpox blamed for Aboriginal deaths |publisher=Canberratimes.com.au |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://caepr.anu.edu.au/Seminars/13/Seminar-Topics%E2%80%94Series-2/07_8_Seminar.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202101013/http://caepr.anu.edu.au/Seminars/13/Seminar-Topics%E2%80%94Series-2/07_8_Seminar.php |archive-date=2 February 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Christopher Warren rejected suggestions that chickenpox has caused the 1789 epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}} ''Journal of Australian Studies'' http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview at endnote 3 of ''Smallpox at Sydney Cove - Who, When, Why?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}} [http://www.rusinsw.org.au/Papers/2014AU05.pdf ''United Service''], Journal of the Royal United Services Institute of New South Wales, vol. 65 (1), March 2014, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren (2014) subsequently rejected the theory that the 1789 epidemic had originated from Macassar.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher: "Smallpox outbreak of Sydney's past" ''Ockhams Razor'' ABC Radio National, 2014. (Access: 18 February 2016) and;  "Smallpox at Sydney Cove - who, when, why?", ''Journal of Australian Studies'', http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2013.849750#preview. {{Full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that there was no evidence of a major outbreak of smallpox in Macassar before 1789;&lt;ref&gt;Warren cites records from Macassan hospitals established by the Dutch East India Company and the results of research by P. Boomgaard, reported in his "Smallpox and Vaccination in Java 1780-1860: Medical Data as a Source for demographic History" in ''Dutch medicine in the Malay Archipelago 1816-1941 : articles presented at a symposium held in honor of Prof. Dr. D. de Moulin on the occasion of his retirement ...''

McCarthy, "Trade in Aboriginal Australia", ''Oceania'', (1929-40), and Dale Kerwin, ''Aboriginal Dreaming Paths and trading Routes: The Colonisation of the Australasian Economic Landscape'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; the Makassan theory was contradicted by Aboriginal oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Warren cites: Luise Hercus and Peter Sutton, eds. ''This is What Happened: Historical Narratives by Aborigines'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and 1829 was the earliest point at which there was possible evidence that Makassans had been the source of a smallpox outbreak.

==Stolen Generations debate==
{{main article|Stolen Generations}}
Despite the lengthy and detailed findings set out in the 1997 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report into the [[Stolen Generation]], which documented the removal of Aboriginal children from their families by Australian State and Federal government agencies and [[Christian Church|church]] missions, the nature and extent of the removals have been disputed within Australia, with some commentators questioning the findings contained in the report and asserting that the Stolen Generation has been exaggerated. Sir [[Ronald Wilson]], former President of the [[Australian Human Rights Commission|Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission]] and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, has stated that none of the more than 500 witnesses who appeared before the Inquiry were cross-examined. This has been the basis of criticism by the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] Government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s148775.htm Stolen Generations], ''Background Briefing'', [[ABC Radio National]], broadcast 2 July 2000.

"Betraying the victims: The ‘Stolen Generations’ Report", in IPA Backgrounder Vol. 10/1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Institute of Public Affairs]] that was criticised in turn by the lawyer [[Hal Wootten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/1998/44.html |last=Wootten |first=H |author-link=Hal Wootten |title=Ron Brunton and Bringing Them Home}} (1998) 4(12) Indigenous Law Bulletin 4.&lt;/ref&gt; An Australian Federal Government submission has questioned the conduct of the Commission which produced the report, arguing that the Commission failed to critically appraise or test the claims on which it based the report and failed to distinguish between those separated from their families "with and without consent, and with and without good reason". Not only has the number of children removed from their parents been questioned, but also the intent and effects of the government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc |title=House of Representatives Members – 45th Parliament 2016- |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043345/http://www.australianpolitics.com/issues/aborigines/2000-govt-submission-on-stolen-generations-summary.doc |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics, such as [[Andrew Bolt]], have questioned the very existence of the Stolen Generation. Bolt stated that it is a "preposterous and obscene" myth and that there was actually no policy in any state or territory at any time for the systematic removal of "half-caste" Aboriginal children. [[Robert Manne]] responded that Bolt did not address the documentary evidence demonstrating the existence of the Stolen Generations and that this is a clear case of [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical]] [[denialism]].&lt;ref name=RM-The-Age&gt;Manne, Robert [http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html The cruelty of denial], [[The Age]], 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt then challenged Manne to produce ten cases in which the evidence justified the claim that children were "stolen" as opposed to having been removed for reasons such as neglect, abuse, abandonment, etc. He argued that Manne did not respond and that this was an indication of unreliability of the claim that there was policy of systematic removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan |first=Kelly |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19610693-25717,00.html |title=Be a Manne and name just 10 &amp;#124; Herald Sun |publisher=News.com.au |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Manne stated that he supplied a documented list of 250 names&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html?page=1 |title=The cruelty of denial - Robert Manne - Opinion |publisher=theage.com.au |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Manne |authorlink=Robert Manne |title=The Stolen Generations - a documentary collection |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/Documents/stolen.pdf |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=3 September 2005 |accessdate=29 December 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolt stated that prior to a debate, Manne provided him with a list of 12 names that he was able to show during the debate was "a list of people abandoned, saved from abuse or voluntarily given up by their parents"; and that during the actual debate, Manne produced a list of 250 names without any details or documentation as to their circumstances. Bolt also stated that he was subsequently able to identify and ascertain the history of some of those on the list and was unable to find a case where there was evidence to justify the term ‘stolen’. He stated that one of the names on the list of allegedly stolen children was 13-year-old Dolly, taken into the care of the State after being "found seven months pregnant and penniless, working for nothing on a station".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/that_debate_last_night/ |title=That debate last night &amp;#124; Herald Sun Andrew Bolt Blog |publisher=Blogs.news.com.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolt/Manne debate is a fair sample of the adversarial debating style in the area.  There is focus on individual examples as evidence for or against the existence of a policy, and little or no analysis of other documentary evidence such as legislative databases showing how the legal basis for removal varied over time and between jurisdictions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/indigenous/ |title=Australian Indigenous Law Library |publisher=AustLII |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or testimony from those who were called on to implement the policies,&lt;ref&gt;''Many Voices: Reflections on Experiences of Indigenous Child Separation'' National Library of Australia Oral History Project, 2002. http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/nov02/article3.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was also recorded in the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report. A recent review of legal cases claims it is difficult for [[Stolen Generation]] claimants to challenge what was written about their situation at the time of removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Buti |first=A |title=The Stolen generation and litigation revisited |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2008/13.html#Heading522}} (2008) 32(2) Melbourne University Law Review 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bringing Them Home|report]] also identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children, or when parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case.

The new Australian Government elected in 2007 issued an Apology similar to those that State Governments had issued at or about the time of the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report ten years earlier. On 13 February 2008, [[Kevin Rudd]], [[Prime Minister of Australia]] moved a formal apology in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],&lt;ref name="apology5694"&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Official Hansard|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/chamber/hansardr/2008-02-13/toc_pdf/5694-9.pdf|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=14 February 2016|format=PDF|date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|167}} which was moved concurrently by the Leader of the Government in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

==Windschuttle's ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History''==
In 2002, historian Keith Windschuttle, in his book ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803-1847'', questions the [[historiography|historical evidence]] used to identify the number of Aboriginal people deliberately killed during European colonisation, especially focusing on the [[Black War]] in Tasmania. He argues that there is credible evidence for the violent deaths of only 118 Tasmanian Aboriginal people, as having been directly killed by the British, although there were undoubtedly an unquantifiable number of other deaths for which no evidence exists. He argues that the Tasmanian Aboriginal population was devastated by a lethal cocktail of introduced diseases to which they had little or no resistance due to their isolation from the mainland and the rest of humanity for thousands of years. The deaths and infertility caused by these introduced diseases, combined with the deaths from what violent conflict there was, rapidly decimated the relatively small Aboriginal population. Windschuttle also examined the nature of those violent episodes that did occur and concluded that there is no credible evidence of warfare over territory. Windschuttle argues that the primary source of conflict between the British and the Aboriginal people was raids by Aboriginal people, often involving violent attacks on settlers, to acquire goods (such as blankets, metal implements and 'exotic' foods) from the British. With this and with a detailed examination of footnotes in and evidence cited by the earlier historical works, he criticises the claims by historians such as [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]] that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. Particular historians and histories that are challenged include Henry Reynolds and the histories of [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]], particularly in [[Tasmania]] (such as in the [[Cape Grim massacre]]) but also elsewhere in Australia. Windschuttle's claims are based upon the argument that the 'orthodox' view of Australian history were founded on hearsay or the misleading use of evidence by historians.

Windschuttle argues that, in order to advance the ‘deliberate genocide’ argument, Reynolds has misused source documentation, including that from British colonist sources, by quoting out of context. In particular, he accuses Reynolds of selectively quoting from responses to an 1830 survey in Tasmania in that Reynolds quoted only from those responses that could be construed as advocating "extermination", "extinction", and "extirpation" and failed to mention other responses to the survey, which indicated that a majority of respondents rejected genocide, were sympathetic to the plight of the Aboriginal people, feared that conflict arising from Aboriginal attacks upon settlers would result in the extinction of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and advocated the adoption of courses of action to prevent this happening.&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, pp. 326-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Windschuttle's claims and research have been disputed by some historians, in ''Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', an anthology including contributions from [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]], edited and introduced by [[Robert Manne]], professor of politics at [[La Trobe University]]. This anthology has itself been the subject of examination by [[Melbourne]] businessman, freelance writer and [[Objectivist movement|Objectivist]] John Dawson, in ''Washout: On the academic response to The Fabrication of Aboriginal History'', which argues that "Whitewash" leaves Windschuttle's claims and research unrefuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=John |date=May 2004 |title=The Catches of Whitewash |url=http://quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=777 |journal=Quadrant |volume=XLVIII |issue=5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060311/https://www.quadrant.org.au/php/archive_details_list.php?article_id=777 |archivedate=8 September 2007 |pages= |doi= |access-date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Contra Windschuttle",  an article published in the conservative publication ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', S.G. Foster examined some of the evidence that Windschuttle presented on one issue, Stanner's notion of the "Great Australian Silence". In Foster’s opinion, the evidence produced by Windschuttle did not prove his case that the "Great Australian Silence" was largely a myth. Windschuttle argues that, in the years prior to Stanner’s 1968 Boyer lecture, Australian historians had not been silent on the Aboriginal people although, in most cases, the historians’ "discussions were not to Stanner’s taste" and the Aboriginal people "might not have been treated in the way Reynolds and his colleagues would have liked".&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle, pp. 408, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster argues that Windschuttle is "merciless with those who get their facts wrong" and that the fact that Windschuttle has also made a mistake&lt;ref&gt;Windschuttle wrote that a particular text was not used at the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales when Foster states that it was: S.G. Foster, Contra Windschuttle&lt;/ref&gt; means that he did not meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' he was arguing against and whom he accused of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence relating to the level and nature of violent conflict between Aboriginal people and white settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foster |first=S.

At the time of the publication of ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One'' it was announced that a second volume, to be published in 2003, would cover claims of frontier violence in New South Wales and Queensland, and a third, in 2004, would cover Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/24/1037697982065.html |title=Our history, not rewritten but put right - smh.com.au |accessdate=6 March 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=25 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 9 February 2008, however, it was announced that the second volume, anticipated to be published later in 2008, would be entitled ''The Fabrication of Australian History, Volume 2: The "Stolen Generations"'' and would address the issue of the removal of Aboriginal children (the "[[stolen generations]]") from their families in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Imre Salusinszky |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23183633-5013404,00.html |title=Imre Salusinszky, Aboriginal 'genocide' claim denied, '&amp;#39;The Australian'&amp;#39;, 9&amp;nbsp;February 2008 |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date=9 February 2008 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new volume was released in January 2010, now listed as ''Volume 3'', with a statement that Volumes 2 and 4 would appear later.&lt;ref name="grossly-inaccurate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/rabbit-proof-fence-grossly-inaccurate-keith-windschuttle/story-e6frf7l6-1225809985321 |title=Rabbit-Proof Fence grossly inaccurate: Keith Windschuttle |website= |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=10 January 2010|date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing the publication, Windschuttle claimed that the film ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' had misrepresented the child removal at the centre of the story, and offered inaccurate accounts of Molly's journey as it was recounted by her daughter, Doris Pilkington. These claims were subsequently rejected by the makers of the film.&lt;ref name="film-makers-dispatch-historian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/film-makers-dispatch-historian-to-the-fence-over-distorted-history/story-e6frg8pf-1225810385666 |title=Filmmakers dispatch historian to the fence over distorted history |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=10 January 2010 |first=Jared |last=Owens |date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuart Macintyre's ''The History Wars''==
In 2003 Australian historian [[Stuart Macintyre]] published ''The History Wars'', written with Anna Clark.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre S, Clark A. ''The History Wars''.  Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-522-85091-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a study of the background of, and arguments surrounding, recent developments in Australian historiography, and concluded that the History Wars had done damage to the nature of objective [[Australian history]]. At the launch of his book, historian [[Stuart Macintyre]] emphasised the political dimension of these arguments&lt;ref&gt;Who plays Stalin in our History Wars? ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 17 September 2003 [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/16/1063625030438.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and said the Australian debate took its cue from the [[Enola Gay]] controversy in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lehigh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/enola/ |title=History on Trial website-Enola Gay Controversy |publisher=Digital.lib.lehigh.edu |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was launched by former Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]], who took the opportunity to criticise conservative views of Australian history, and those who hold them (such as the then Prime Minister [[John Howard]]), saying that they suffered from "a failure of imagination", and said that ''The History Wars'' "rolls out the canvas of this debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/05/1062549021882.html |title=Keating's 'History Wars' - OpinionWebDiaryArchive2003 |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date= 5 September 2003|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintyre's critics, such as Greg Melluish (History Lecturer at the [[University of Wollongong]]), responded to the book by declaring that Macintyre was a partisan history warrior himself, and that "its primary arguments are derived from the pro-Communist polemics of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/summer03-04/polsumm0304-7.htm |title=Policy |publisher=Cis.org.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013130222/http://www.cis.org.au/Policy/summer03-04/polsumm0304-7.htm |archivedate=13 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Windschuttle said that Macintyre attempted to "caricature the history debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s938399.htm |title=Lateline - 03/09/2003: Authors in history debate . Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a foreword to the book, former [[Chief Justice of Australia]] Sir [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] said that the book was "a fascinating study of the recent endeavours to rewrite or reinterpret the history of European settlement in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Stuart &amp; Clark, Anna, p. ??&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Museum of Australia controversy==
In 2001, writing in ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quadrant.org.au/about-us/| title=About Us|accessdate=3 February 2016|work = Quadrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] argued that the then-new [[National Museum of Australia]] (NMA) was marred by "[[political correctness]]" and did not present a balanced view of the nation's history.&lt;ref&gt;How not to run a museum: People's history at the postmodern museum. reproduced at {{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/National%20Museum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820050424/http://www.sydneyline.com/National%20Museum.htm |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the [[Howard Government]] commissioned a review of the NMA. A potentially controversial issue was in assessing how well the NMA met the criterion that displays should: "Cover darker historical episodes, and with a gravity that opens the possibility of collective self-accounting. The role here is in helping the nation to examine fully its own past, and the dynamic of its history—with truthfulness, sobriety and balance. This extends into covering present-day controversial issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/review/review_report_20030715/files/552/ReviewReport20030715.pdf |title=dcit10442_text |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328123706/http://www.nma.gov.au/shared/libraries/attachments/review/review_report_20030715/files/552/ReviewReport20030715.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the report concluded that there was no systemic bias, it recommended that there be more recognition in the exhibits of European achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/about_us/ips/review-of-exhibitions-and-public-programs |title=Review of Exhibitions and Public Programs, 2003 |publisher=National Museum of Australia |date= |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The report drew the ire of some historians in Australia, who claimed that it was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to politicise the museum and move it more towards a position which [[Geoffrey Blainey]] called the 'three cheers' view of [[History of Australia|Australian history]], rather than the '[[#Black armband debate|black armband]]' view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s902872.htm |title=Lateline - 15/07/2003: Museum review attracts historians ire . Australian Broadcasting Corp |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 columnist [[Miranda Devine]] described some of the [[Braille]] messages encoded on the external structure of the NMA, including "sorry" and "forgive us our genocide" and how they had been covered over by aluminium discs in 2001, and stated that under the new Director "what he calls the 'black T-shirt' view of [[Culture of Australia|Australian culture]]" is being replaced by "systematically reworking the collections, with attention to 'scrupulous historical accuracy'".&lt;ref name="DevineApr06"&gt;{{cite news | last = Devine | first = Miranda | authorlink = Miranda Devine  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/miranda-devine/the-embedded-messages-that-adorn-museum/2006/04/01/1143441377890.html | title = Opinion: Disclosed at last, the embedded messages that adorn museum | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate =11 June 2006 | date=2 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the current approach at the NMA is the Bells Falls Gorge Interactive display, which presents Windschuttles's view of an alleged massacre alongside other views and contemporary documents and displays of weapons relating to [[Australian frontier wars#New South Wales|colonial conflict around Bathurst in 1824]] and invites visitors to make up their own minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/classroom_learning/multimedia/interactives/bells_falls_gorge |title=Bells Falls Gorge interactive display |publisher=National Museum of Australia |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of New South Wales controversy==
Publication in 2016 of "Indigenous Terminology" guidelines&lt;ref&gt;"Indigenous Terminology" University of New South Wales ; https://teaching.unsw.edu.au/indigenous-terminology
&lt;/ref&gt; for the teaching and writing of history by the [[University of New South Wales]] created a brief media uproar.&lt;ref&gt;''Invasion of the history rewriters'', Daily Telegraph 30 March 2016; http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/invasion-of-the-history-rewriters/news-story/d18774ad2553314898261298cef4e17d&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the advised language changes, they recommended "settlement" be replaced by "invasion", "colonisation" or "occupation". They also deemed that the generally accepted anthropological assumption&lt;ref&gt;Ried, James ''‘Invaded’ not settled: UNSW rewrites history'' The New Daily 30 March 2016; http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2016/03/30/invaded-settled-unsw-rewrite-australian-history/&lt;/ref&gt; that "Aboriginal people have lived in Australia for 40,000 years" should be dropped for "... since the beginning of the Dreaming/s" as it "reflects the beliefs of many Indigenous Australians that they have always been in Australia, from the beginning of time" and because "many Indigenous Australians see this sort of measurement and quantifying as inappropriate." While some commentators considered the guidelines appropriate,&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Paul ''It's not 'politically correct' to say Australia was invaded, it's history'', The Guardian'' (Australia) 30 March 2016; https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/mar/30/its-not-politically-correct-to-say-australia-was-invaded-its-history&lt;/ref&gt; others categorised them as political correctness that was an anathema to learning and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Chris ''Australian university accused of 'rewriting history' over British invasion language'', The Telegraph (London) 30 March 2016; https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/12207016/Australian-university-accused-of-rewriting-history-over-British-invasion-language.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History wars and culture wars==
The "history wars" are widely viewed, by external observers and participants on both sides as similar to the "[[culture war]]" underway in the United States. William D. Rubinstein, writing for the conservative British think tank the [[Social Affairs Unit]], refers to the history wars as "the Culture War down under".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubinstein |first=William D. |url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/001055.php |title=Web Review: The Culture Wars Down Under: Keith Windschuttle, the Aboriginal people, and the Left - Part Two |publisher=The Social Affairs Unit |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the debate including [[Keith Windschuttle]] and [[Robert Manne]] are frequently described as "culture warriors" for their respective points of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/pms-contempt-for-abc/2006/06/16/1149964738584.html |title=PM's contempt for ABC - Opinion |publisher=theage.com.au |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne |first=Robert |last=Manne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/15/1149964674485.html |title=ABC gets a culture warrior - National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2010 | location=Melbourne |first1=Michelle |last1=Grattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in an [[information explosion]] and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M.

Digital Technology and Social Change [Open Online Course at the University of California] freely available at: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/949415&lt;/ref&gt; The people who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called [[digital citizen]]s, defined by K. Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |authorlink= James R.

Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, knowledge society, telematic society, [[Information Revolution]], [[liquid modernity]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]).

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilbert InfoGrowth.png|thumb|right|360px|The amount of data stored globally has increased greatly since the 1980s, and by 2007, 94% of it was stored digitally. [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html Source]]]

The growth of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world’s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crawford: "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=227258 The Origin and Development of a Concept: The Information Society]". ''Bull Med Libr Assoc.'' 71(4) October 1983: 380–385.&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of getting information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==

In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics'']. Moscow: KomKniga/URSS. P.10-38. {{ISBN|978-5-484-01001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order.  The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society.  The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order.  The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded.  The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and [[industrial revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]].  The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space.  The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales.  The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing.  Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society.  Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, appeared [[information pollution]], evolving [[information ecology]] - associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint]// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, It is important to selectively select the information. Due to information revolution, the amount of information is puzzling. Among these, we need to develop techniques that refine information. This is called ''data mining.'' It is an engineering term, but it is used in sociology. In other words, if the amount of information was competitive in the past, the quality of information is important today.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116.

'''''Inventio Fortunata''''' (also '''''Inventio Fortunate''''', '''''Inventio Fortunat''''' or '''''Inventio Fortunatae'''''), "''Fortunate, or fortune-making, discovery''", is a [[lost work|lost book]], probably dating from the 14th century, containing a description of the [[North Pole]] as a [[magnetic]] island (the [[Rupes Nigra]]) surrounded by a giant [[whirlpool]] and [[Hyperborea|four continents]]. No direct extracts from the document have been discovered, but its influence on the Western idea of the geography of the [[Arctic]] region persisted for several centuries.

==The story of the ''Inventio''==
The book is said to be a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] written by a 14th-century [[Franciscan]] (Minorite) [[friar]] from [[Oxford]] who travelled the North Atlantic region in the early 1360s, making some half-a-dozen journeys conducting business on behalf of the King of England ([[Edward III]]). He described what he found on his first journey  to the islands beyond 54 degrees north in a book, ''Inventio Fortunata'', which he presented to the King.

Unfortunately, by the time Atlantic explorers were seeking information in the 1490s, the ''Inventio'' had gone missing, and was only known through a summary in a second text, the ''[[Itinerarium]],'' written by a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantian]] traveller from [['s-Hertogenbosch]] named Jacobus Cnoyen (also known as James Cnoyen or Jakob van Knoyen; modern Knox). As will be discussed below, Cnoyen's summary was the basis for the depiction of the Arctic region on many maps, one of the earliest being Martin Behaim's 1492 globe. By the late 16th century, even Cnoyen's text was missing, so most of what we know of the contents of the ''Inventio Fortunata'', other than its use on maps, is found in a letter from the Flemish [[cartographer]] [[Gerardus Mercator]] to the English astronomer [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] dated April 20, 1577, now located in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Citation

Cnoyen's information came in a very round-about way. In 1364, a priest from one of the Atlantic islands had returned to [[Norway]], bringing with him an [[astrolabe]] which he had received from the visiting Franciscan friar, in exchange for a religious book. He made a detailed report to the King of Norway. Copies still survive of a social and geographical description of [[Greenland]] by a local church official named Ivar Bardarson, who turns up in Norwegian records in 1364, so this much of Cnoyen's story tallies well with reality (although this report does not contain the sort of personal information relayed by Cnoyen). Cnoyen seems to have obtained his information from Norwegian sources some time later, neither he nor the priest having actually seen the ''Inventio''.

Cnoyen's account (originally in his own language; translations here based on Eva Taylor's version&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;) mixes probable fact with what may have been his own attempts to research the background, stating that Greenland was first settled at the orders of [[King Arthur]], whose army supposedly conquered the North Atlantic islands. He also refers to the "indrawing seas"- currents which drew ships northward, so that:

:"nearly 4000 persons entered the indrawing seas who never returned. But in A.D. 1364 eight of these people came to the King's Court in Norway.  Among them were two priests, one of whom had an astrolabe, who was descended in the 5th generation from a [[Brussels]] citizen. One, I say: all eight were from those who had penetrated the northern regions in the first ships."

Of the visiting Franciscan, Cnoyen (or Mercator) summarised the priest's report thus:

:"Leaving the rest of the party who had come to the Islands, he journeyed further, through the whole of the North etc, and put into writing all the wonders of those Islands, and gave the King of England this book, which he called in Latin ''Inventio Fortunatae''."

In reality, the "book" may have been a detailed report, intended mainly to highlight the commercial possibilities offered by the North Atlantic following the decline of Norwegian interest in its colonies.

==Authorship==
Mercator's contemporary, the 16th-century English historian [[Richard Hakluyt]], identifies the author of the ''Inventio'' as [[Nicholas of Lynn]]. Hakluyt apparently arrived at this conclusion because of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s mention of Nicholas in his ''Treatise on the Astrolabe.'' Hakluyt did not himself, of course, have a copy of the ''Inventio.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries
 |url = http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Principal-Navigations-Voyages-Traffiquesx52282.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas was alive at the right time (very roughly -- he is quite likely to have been a child in 1360), and had the right skills, but he was a [[Carmelite]] friar, not a Franciscan, and no earlier biographer indicates that he spent years travelling back and forth across the Atlantic on government business. There is another possible candidate, about whom, unfortunately, almost nothing is known. According to early 16th century literary historian John Bale, an Irishman named Hugh, who was a Franciscan, travelled widely in the 14th century, and wrote "a certain journey in one volume" -- but again, whether or not this was the ''Inventio'', no copy of it is known.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;

==Influence on maps==


The concept of the pole as a magnetic mountain goes back at least to Roman times, but the author of ''Inventio Fortunata'' added other features to the picture as well as measurements. Whether or not the ''Inventio'' is the source of the medieval concept of the North Pole as a magnetic mountain surrounded by a circular continent divided by four powerful rivers, maps as early as [[Martin Behaim]]'s 1492 globe depict the region in this way. 

[[Johannes Ruysch]]'s ''Universalior cogniti orbis tabula'' from 1508, features a marginal note mentioning the ''Inventio Fortunata:''
:"It is said in the book concerning the fortunate discovery [Inventio Fortunate] that at the arctic pole there is a high magnetic rock, thirty-three German miles in circumference. A surging sea surrounds this rock, as if the water were discharged downward from a vase through an opening. Around it are islands, two of which are inhabited."

[[Image:Mercator north pole 1595.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mercator's map from 1595 showing the [[Hyperborea|Arctic continent]].]]
[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s world map of 1569 reflects his reading of Cnoyen's ''Itinerarium.'' It also features a marginal note alluding to the Franciscan's "discovery", but not to the book itself, which he never saw: 

:"we have taken [the Arctic geography] from the Itinerium of Jacobus Cnoyen of the Hague, who makes some citations from the Gesta of Arthur of Britain; however, the greater and most important part he learned from a certain priest at the court of the king of Norway in 1364. He was descended in the fifth generation from those whom Arthur had sent to inhabit these lands, and he related that in the year 1360 a certain Minorite, an Englishman from Oxford, a mathematician, went to those islands; and leaving them, advanced still farther by magic arts and mapped out all and measured them by an astrolabe in practically the subjoined figure, as we have learned from Jacobus. The four canals there pictured he said flow with such current to the inner whirlpool, that if vessels once enter they cannot be driven back by wind." 

The Arctic map inset on Mercator's 1569 world map was the prototype for the influential and widely circulated ''Septentrionalium Terrarum'' of 1595, posthumously published by his son, and the maps in [[Ortelius]]'s ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of 1570. Both show the same configuration of the arctic regions as the 1569 map.

In his letter to Dee, Mercator further quotes Cnoyen's description of the Northern regions: 

:"...In the midst of the four countries is a Whirlpool into which there empty these four Indrawing Seas which divide the North. And the water rushes round and descends into the earth just as if one were pouring it through a filter funnel. It is 4 degrees wide on every side of the Pole, that is to say eight degrees altogether. Except that right under the Pole there lies a bare rock in the midst of the Sea. Its circumference is almost 33 French miles, and it is all of magnetic stone. And is as high as the clouds, so the Priest said, who had received the astrolabe from this Minorite in exchange for a Testament. And the Minorite himself had heard that one can see all round it from the Sea, and that it is black and glistening. And nothing grows thereon, for there is not so much as a handful of soil on it."

The persistence of this idea of the geography of the far north persisted throughout the 16th and 17th century. This is probably due to the influence of Ruysch, Mercator, and Ortelius. Maps were only revised when the region was explored and mapmakers obtained knowledge of the true geography of the Arctic.

More interesting to modern researchers are the people the friar encountered, "pygmies" who may well be identical with the [[Skraelings]] referred to in old Norse texts about Greenland, predecessors of the modern [[Inuit]].

==The John Day letter==
In 1956 a letter referring to the existence of the book was found in the ''[[Archivo General de Simancas]]'' (Spain) from the English merchant [[John Day (merchant)|John Day]] to "The Most Magnificent And Most Worthy Lord - The Lord Grand Admiral" (presumably [[Christopher Columbus]]).

In the letter, written in either December 1497 or January 1498, John Day says, 

:"...''Your Lordship's servant brought me your letter. I have seen its contents and I would be most desirous and most happy to serve you. I do not find the book Inventio Fortunata, and I thought that I (or he) was bringing it with my things, and I am very sorry not [to] find it because I wanted very much to serve you. I am sending the other book of [[Marco Polo]] and a copy of the land which has been found [by [[John Cabot]]]…"''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''''Kronos: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Synthesis''''' published articles on topics related to the theories of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]],&lt;ref&gt;''Kronos: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Synthesis''. Vol.1 No. 1 (Spring 1975) "Editorial Statement". {{ISSN|0361-6584}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was "founded, with no apologies, to deal with Velikovsky's work";&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Lewis M. (1993). Of Ponderosas and Heinekens. ''Aeon'', '''3''' (2), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such hosted epigraphs on a wide range of subjects from [[ancient history]], [[catastrophism]] and [[mythology]]. It ran 44 issues from the Spring of 1975 to the Spring of 1988. The title is an homage to the Greek name for the Roman god Saturn whose planetary namesake Velikovsky believed Earth once orbited as a satellite. Professor of Social Theory [[Alfred de Grazia]] at New York University, co-author of ''The Velikovsky Affair'' and avowed supporter of some of Velikovsky's maverick ideas, however, remarked that although the journal was devoted to discussing Velikovsky's ideas, "[t]his is not to say that the directors of Kronos were uncritical".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred de Grazia, Cosmic Heretics, "Ch. 5. [http://www.quantavolution.org/vol_02/cosmicheretics_1_05.htm The British Connection]", October 1984, Metron Publ. 397pp. {{ISBN|978-0-940268-08-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was published by Kronos Press, a division of Cosmos and Chronos (a US-registered 501(c) organization). Its subscription list grew to about 2000&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Ann (1980). "Velikovsky Lives!" ''Science Digest Special'', Sept/Oct, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; and then settled to about 1500 people from 10 countries.&lt;ref name="bauer"&gt;Henry H. Bauer, ''[http://www.press.uillinois.edu/pre95/0-252-06845-9.html Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy]'', (1984) University of Illinois Press, {{ISBN|978-0-252-06845-4}}. This book is described as "A very valuable contribution to the literature on a major controversy" by NASA Institute director [[Robert Jastrow]], and, "Bauer's remarkable book will be viewed, even by Velikovskians, as a great improvement over previous critical studies" by (Prof) [[Marcello Truzzi]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Actually, in 1980 the United States and Canada accounted for 93% of circulation with the balance in 20 foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;Subscriber List in archives of C. Leroy Ellenberger. These statistics were not available to Bauer who restricted his research to public information.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

Two issues of ''Kronos'' were also published as books:
*''Velikovsky and Establishment Science'' (''Kronos'' Vol. III, No. 2 Winter 1977), {{ISBN|978-0-917994-03-6}}.
*''Scientists Confront Scientists Who Confront Velikovsky'' (''Kronos'' Vol. IV, No. 2 Winter 1978), {{ISBN|978-0-917994-06-7}}.
Both issues concerned the 1974 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] meeting in San Francisco (Mon Feb 25, 1974) in a session "Velikovsky's Challenge to Science",&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science, 140th Annual Meeting, Feb 24 - Mar 1, 1974, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; whose papers were subsequently published in the book ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Donald Goldsmith (ed), ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'', Cornell University Press (1977), {{ISBN|978-0-8014-0961-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (with exception of the papers from Velikovsky himself and Irving Michelson, and additional papers by the editor, Goldsmith, [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]]).

==History==

''Kronos'' was founded in October 1974, by (1) then Associate Professor of Art History Lewis M. Greenberg of the [[Moore College of Art and Design|Moore College of Art]] (Philadelphia), whose title was Editor-in-Chief, (2) with financing, production, and management being coordinated by then Associate Professor of Religion Warner B. Sizemore at [[Glassboro State College]] as Executive Editor, and (3) by then Professor of History Robert H. Hewsen at [[Glassboro State College]] as the first Senior Editor who was also Director of the Center for Velikovskian and Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Glassboro State College]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Center for Velikovskian and Interdisciplinary Studies", ''Kronos'' Vol. I No. 1 (Spring 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; With the completion of volume XII in May 1988, the Editor-in-Chief announced "KRONOS will go on hiatus with the expectation that a publication schedule can be resumed some time in 1990."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Lewis M. (1988) ''KRONOS'', '''12''' (3), inside front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hiatus was permanent.

==Reception==

In his book ''Beyond Velikovsky'', [[Henry H. Bauer]] (a person who himself is criticized for supporting various [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific ideas]]) commented on a number of pro-Velikovskian journals, including ''Kronos'', and noted:
:"Contributors to these journals range from orthodox specialists who expound some aspect of their specialty, at times in criticism of Velikovskian ideas, through established specialists who keep an open mind about various aspects of Velikovsky's scenario, to the real aficionados. There are people with impeccable credentials here; see, for example, the staff of ''Kronos'', which was listed together with professional identifications in each issue of the first five volumes of that journal: anthropologists, philosophers, physicists, psychologists, and others holding responsible positions in and outside academia."&lt;ref name="bauer" /&gt;

[[Robert Schadewald]] commented that "Though Velikovsky's views were rejected by scientists, a small but vociferous band of followers carries on Velikovsky’s work. They also publish a journal, Kronos, which is at least as scientific as the [[Creation Research Society]] Quarterly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schadewald|first=Robert|title=Worlds of Their Own: A Brief History of Misguided Ideas - Creationism, Flat-Earthism, Energy Scams, and the Velikovsky Affair|date=2008|publisher=Xlibris|isbn=978-1436304351|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9BM6DzFGGwC&amp;pg=PT210&amp;dq=journal+Kronos+velikovsky&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=isiBU8abBcm_OYyIgcgL&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=journal%20Kronos%20velikovsky&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the German army retreated during the later stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the urban areas of what is now Poland were severely damaged as a result of military action between the retreating forces of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] and advancing ones of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces.  One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of [[Warsaw]], the [[capital city|capital]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="anthonymtung"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony M. Tung| title = Preserving the world's great cities:The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis|edition= 2001| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| isbn= 0-517-70148-0|url=http://www.anthonymtung.com/excerpts.htm#Chap4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While extensively damaged by the failed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Uprising]], the city later underwent a [[Destruction of Warsaw|planned demolition]] by German forces under order from [[Adolf Hitler]] and high officials within the Nazi government. On 17 October 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] famously stated, "The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."&lt;ref name= "Wituska, Tomaszewski p. xxii"&gt;[[#refWituskaTomaszewski2006|Wituska, Tomaszewski 2006]], p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before they were stopped by the advancing Red Army, 85% of the city had been taken out.&lt;ref name= "Free Europe Committee p. 10"/&gt;  Warsaw was far from the worst off after the Nazi retreat; 97% of [[Jasło]]&lt;ref name="austriantimes"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2009|url = http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-07/14509/Polish_town_at_odds_over_Hitler%92s_oak|title = Polish town at odds over Hitler's oak|format = |publisher = Austrian Times| accessdate = October 8, 2009 | last=Lisa Chapman |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of [[Polanów]] were reduced to rubble.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Other towns such as [[Wałcz]] fared better, with only a quarter of the city being destroyed.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Ancient historical buildings in Polish cities were not spared; for example, [[Trzemeszno]]'s [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of 1130-45 was burnt down in 1945.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;

{{Democracy}}

This is an incomplete list of wars between entities that have a [[constitution]]ally [[democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]] and actually practice it. Two points are required: that there has been a war, and that there are democracies on at least two opposing sides. For many of these entries, whether there has been a war, or a democracy, is a debatable question; all significant views should be given. For example, see [[list of types of democracy]].

==Definition dependence==
:''See also: [[List of types of democracy]], [[History of democracy]],  and [[Democratic peace theory]].''
Almost all of these depend on the definition of "democracy" (and of "war") employed. As James Lee Ray points out, with a sufficiently restrictive definition of democracy, there will be no wars between democracies: define democracy as true universal suffrage, the right of all – including children – to vote, and there have been no democracies, and so no wars between them.

On the other hand, Ray lists the following as having been called wars between democracies,  with broader definitions of democracy: The [[American Revolution]] including the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Belgian Revolution]], the [[Sonderbund War]], the war of 1849 between the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] and the [[Second French Republic]], the [[American Civil War]], the [[Spanish–American War]], the [[Second Philippine War]], the [[Second Boer War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]] (as a whole, and also the [[Continuation War]] by itself), the [[Israeli War of Independence]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]–1948, the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Armenia-Azerbaijan War]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lee Ray: "Wars between democracies: Rare, or nonexistent?", ''International Interactions'' Volume 18, Issue 3 February 1993, pages 251–276; child suffrage and  from Ray, ''Democracy and International Conflict'' p.88. Restricted definitions of democracy can also be constructed which define away all wars between democracies, and yet include many regimes often held to be democratic; Ray finds this more rhetorically effective than saying that ''full-scale'' international war between ''established'' democracies with ''wide'' suffrage is less likely than between other pairs of states.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes also had democratic forms of government, and they often fought each other up until the late 19th century, as did many tribes of [[Norsemen]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Similarly, the school of [[Ted Robert Gurr]], founder of the [[Polity IV]] dataset, divides regimes into three classes: democracies, autocracies, and "[[Anocracy|anocracies]]"; the last being the sort of weak or new states which are marginal democracies or marginal autocracies; many of the wars below involve weak or marginal democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Ze'ev Maoz, Nasrin Abdolali, "Regime Types and International Conflict, 1816–1976", ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''  vol. 33, no. 1 (March 1986) pp. 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early democracy==

===Greek democracies===
{{See also|Athenian democracy}}
The [[Peloponnesian war]] included a great many conflicts among Greek city-states. The principal war was between Athens and her allies (most of them democracies) on one side, and Sparta and her allies (most of them oligarchies—although most of them held elections among a citizen body{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}) on the other. But the war lasted for twenty-seven years, with a brief armistice, and a great many side-conflicts occurred; and states changed from democracy to oligarchy and back again. Most notable of the wars between democracies was the [[Sicilian Expedition]], 415–413 BC, in which Athens went to war with [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. [[Bruce Russett]] finds 13 conflicts between "clear" democratic pairs (most of these being Athens and allies in the Sicilian Expedition) and 25 involving "other" democratic pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Russett, ''Grasping the Democratic Peace'', p. 47–71; Russett, one of the few to consider the democratic peace before 1750, thinks it likely that the norm of interdemocratic peace developed gradually through the centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; Classicist [[Mogens Herman Hansen]] thinks one of Russett's examples unlikely, but adds several instances of wars between democracies before and after the Peloponnesian War.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen ''et al.'': ''An inventory of archaic and classical poleis'' (2005), p. 85 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Republic===
{{See also|Constitution of the Roman Republic}}
The constitution of the [[Roman Republic]], before its collapse in the late 1st century BC, is amply documented; its magistrates (including the [[Roman Senate]], which was composed of current and former magistrates) were elected by universal suffrage by adult (male) citizens; all male citizens were eligible. There was a political class of wealthy men; most successful candidates belonged to this class, and all of them were supported by a party drawn from it, but this does not distinguish Rome from other democracies—nor, indeed, from non-democratic states; freedom of speech was, however, a characteristic difference between the Republic and the later [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Syme]], ''The Roman Revolution'' (1939, repr. and revised 1962), including the view on the oligarchy behind ''all'' constitutions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Punic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;David Churchman, ''Why We Fight: Theories of Aggression and Human Conflict'', University Press of America (2005), p.143, who discusses Rome ''and'' Carthage.&lt;/ref&gt; The old constitution of Carthage, before the [[First Punic War]], was described by Aristotle as a mixture of democracy and oligarchy; after the disastrous end of that war, about 240&amp;nbsp;BC, there was a democratic change, the direct election of a pair of executives, and the [[Second Punic War]] was fought under that constitution; there continued to be an oligarchic party.  There were several further changes of party, and democratic reforms; the election of the democratic party, which favored a less passive foreign policy, in 151&amp;nbsp;BC provoked Rome to begin the [[Third Punic War]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Lancel: ''History of Carthage'' (1993, Eng. tr. 1995) pp. 116–120, 411; Richard Miles ''"Carthage must be destroyed"'' (2010): 214, 318, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[First Balkan War]] (1912–13): The [[Young Turks]] had re-established constitutional government in Ottoman Turkey in 1908, and continued to struggle for greater liberalization;&lt;ref&gt;Ayhat Kansu, ''Politics in post-revolutionary Turkey, 1908-1913'', passim&lt;/ref&gt; the "relatively democratic" Constitution of Serbia had been restored in 1903, and attained complete openness of executive recruitment. Serbia and its allies, the constitutional monarchies of Greece and Bulgaria, won the war; Turkey suffered a military coup as a result of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; pp. 210-11, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First World War]]: The Polity IV dataset does not rank any of the [[Central Powers]] as democracies, although the component of democracy for Germany had been higher than that of autocracy since the 1890s, when Bismarck was replaced by [[Leo von Caprivi]];&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; neither does the somewhat controversial&lt;ref&gt;Vanhanen calls his own methodology of ranking democracies approximate, and subject to short-term variation; others call it "unacceptable", and using "invalid" or "controversial" indicators; see Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p. 36,61. He primarily uses it to measure and compare long-term trends in the democracy of single countries, in which such fluctuations will cancel out.&lt;/ref&gt; ranking of [[Tatu Vanhanen]];&lt;ref&gt;Tatu Vanhanen, ''Democratization: a comparative analysis of 170 countries'', Routledge, 2003, p72&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, all of the Central Powers had elected parliaments; the Reichstag had been elected by universal suffrage, and voted on whether a credit essential to the German conduct of the war should be granted. Whether this is democratic control over the foreign policy of the Kaiser is "a difficult case"; [[Michael W. Doyle]] concludes, however, that the government was not absolutely dependent on the Reichstag - and that Germany was a [[dyarchy]], effectively a mixture of two different constitutions, and democratic on internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael W. (1983a). "Kant, Liberal Legacies, and Foreign Affairs". Philosophy and Public Affairs 12 (Vol. 12, No. 3. (Summer, 1983)): p216&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polish–Lithuanian War]]: Fought in 1920, with about 1000 estimated battle deaths. In both states, elections had been held with universal suffrage. In the polity scale, Poland received a +8 rating in combined democracy/autocracy in 1920, while Lithuania received a +7 in democracy and a +4 in combined democracy/autocracy.&lt;ref name="PIVP"/&gt; The conflict is seen by both Polish and Lithuanian historians as a part of the wars of independence from the Soviet Union.
* [[Continuation War]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Small | first1 = Melvin | last2 = Singer | first2 = David J. | year = 1976 | title = The War Proneness of Democratic Regimes, 1816-1965 | url = | journal = Jerusalem Journal of International Relations | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 50–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal state of war between the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], on one side, and [[Finland]] on the other, resulting from the Soviet Union bombing of Finland in 1941; there was actual conflict between the United Kingdom and Finland, including [[Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo|an air raid against Finnish territory]], with associated attacks on Finnish shipping, although that took place some months before the declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gleditsch, Nils P. | title=Democracy and Peace | journal=Journal of Peace Research | year=1992 |volume=29 | pages= 369–376| doi=10.1177/0022343392029004001 |issue=4 | ref=harv | jstor=425538}}; Wayman, Frank (2002).

* [[Israeli War of Independence]]: as against Lebanon; Israel had not yet held elections.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Russett, ''Controlling the Sword: the Democratic Governance of National Security'' (1990), p.123: "the nearest exception"; Russett notes that Singer and Small (see note on the Continuation war) do not count Israel as yet being a democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a briefer discussion of the emerging democracy of India and the ultimately unsuccessful democracy of the Dominion of Pakistan, see Mansfield and Snyder, ''Electing to Fight'', MIT Press, 2007; pp. 241-2.&lt;/ref&gt; There were fewer than a thousand battlefield casualties in this war.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Both countries, then Dominions, then had governments based on the [[Government of India Act 1935]], implemented 1937, which set up [[Westminster democracy]] for all of British India;&lt;ref&gt;Imtiaz Omar: ''Emergency powers and the courts in India and Pakistan'', 2002, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; in Pakistan, the politicians, at odds with the civilian bureaucracy, failed to maintain civilian control over the military, and converted the Governor-Generalship into a political office; there was a military coup ten years after the war; the Polity IV dataset counts it as anocratic until 1957-8 (see [[#Definition dependence|above]]), the years before the coup; the same dataset shows India as having been a stable democracy throughout the period.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of India'', Volume IV, part 1, ''Politics of India since independence'', p. 61; for more discussion of the destruction of Pakistan's first democracy, see Ian Talbot: ''A short history of Pakistan'', chapter 5, which cites the detailed history of the period, Allan McGrath, ''The Destruction of Pakistan's Democracy (1998).

Paul: ''The India-Pakistan Conflict; An Enduring Rivalry'' (2005), p. 47-8, which considers a difference of +7 the line marking full democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Six-Day War]]: The Lebanese air force intervened against Israel, both then being democratic states;&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, Michael W. (1983a). "Kant, Liberal Legacies, and Foreign Affairs". Philosophy and Public Affairs 12 (Vol. 12, No. 3.

Ecuador receives a rating of +9 in the [[Polity data series|polity scale]] of combined democracy/autocracy, while Peru receives a +7, meaning that both countries are classified as democratic, and Ecuador even as "very democratic".&lt;ref name="PIVP"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Polity IV Project | url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm| accessdate=March 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the war involved only as high as two hundred deaths in battle.{{dubious|date=February 2018}} Furthermore, the Peruvian democracy was less than one year old and the Ecuadorian less than 3 years.

The '''long 19th century''' is a term coined for the period between the years 1789 and 1914 by Russian literary critic and author [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/long-centuries/ |title=Long Centuries |publisher=the-tls.co.uk |date= April 29, 2011  |author= Gasan Gusejnov |accessdate= December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian and author [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. The concept is an adaption of [[Fernand Braudel]]'s 1949 notion of ''le long seizième siècle'' ("the long 16th century" 1450–1640).&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. (1972). The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II
(Vol. 1; S. Reynolds, Trans.). New York: Harper &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt; and "a recognized category of [[History of literature|literary history]]", although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slu.edu/Documents/arts_sciences/english/Long%2019th%20Century.pdf |title=Long 19th Century |publisher=slu.edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm's 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering, "French Society: 1589–1715 –  the long seventeenth century", E. Anthony Wrigley, "British population during the ‘long’ eighteenth century, 1680–1840", or D. Blackbourn, "The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780–1918".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treasedademin.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/26032413.pdf |title=French Society: 1589–1715 |publisher=treasedademin |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/wrigley/ |title=Department of Geography, Cambridge » Tony Wrigley – British population during the 'long' eighteenth century, 1680-1840 |publisher=Geog.cam.ac.uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2349 |title=H-Net Reviews - David Blackbourn.

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in ''[[The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848]]'' (1962), ''[[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875]]'' (1975), and ''[[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914]]'' (1987). Hobsbawn starts his long 19th century with the [[French Revolution]], which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the [[outbreak of World War I]], upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring [[European balance of power|European power balance]] of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.  In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, ''[[The Age of Extremes|The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991]]'' (1994), Hobsbawm details [[Short twentieth century|the short 20th century]] beginning with [[World War I]] and ending with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]].

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by [[Peter N. Stearns]] in the context of the [[world history]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|title=World Civilizations: The Global Experience|year=2011|publisher=[[Longman]]|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-136020-4|edition=6th|author2=Michael Adas|author3=Stuart B. Schwartz|author4=Marc Jason Gilbert|authorlink=Peter Stearns|authorlink2=Michael Adas|authorlink3=Stuart B. Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the [[history of the Catholic Church]], the long 19th century was a period of centralization of [[Papacy|papal]] power over the [[Catholic Church]]. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals.  The church's long 19th century extended from the [[French Revolution#Revolution and the Church|French Revolution]] (1789) until the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Malley | first = John W. | author-link = John W.

From the 16th to the early 19th century Skanderbeg's fame survived only in Christian [[Europe]] and was based on perception of Skanderbeg being [[Antemurale Christianitatis]] against invading Turks. In largely Islamized [[Albania]] of this period his fame faded, to be rediscovered at the end of the 19th century when the figure of Skanderbeg was brought to the level of [[national hero (disambiguation)|national hero]].

Skanderbeg is built in part of the [[antemurale myth]] complex which portrays [[Albanians]] united by Skanderbeg as protectors of the [[nation]] and [[Christendom]] against "invading Turks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Endresen|first=Cecilie |editor=Oliver Jens Schmitt |editor-link=Oliver Jens Schmitt |title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen Südosteuropa |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=%22myth+about+skanderbeg%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IsqNTf2IBoaWswa3_qGMCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume= 4 |year=2010 |publisher= |location=Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Bern, Bruxelles, New York, Oxford, Wien |isbn= 978-3-631-60295-9 |page=249 |chapter= |quote=The ''antemurale'' myth and Skanderbeg: A built-in part of ''antemurale'' myth complex is Skanderbeg... united Albanians in the fight against invading Turks and that his primary motive was defence of the nation (although the churchmen equate that with defence of the Christendom)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the influence of the Myth of Skanderbeg and antemurale myth, the Albanian [[Catholic clergy]] seems to understand the figure of [[Mother Teresa]] as Skanderbeg's ideological heir who completes his task of guarding the boundaries of [[Catholicism]] and Albanianism, introducing a new era after the end of glorious era that culminated with Skanderbeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Endresen|first=Cecilie |editor=Oliver Jens Schmitt |editor-link=Oliver Jens Schmitt |title=Religion und Kultur im albanischsprachigen Südosteuropa |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aCdYHU9PtiIC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=%22myth+about+skanderbeg%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IsqNTf2IBoaWswa3_qGMCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= |volume= 4 |year=2010 |publisher= |location=Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Bern, Bruxelles, New York, Oxford, Wien |isbn= 978-3-631-60295-9 |page=250 |chapter= |quote=The Catholic clergy seems to understand Mother Teresa as Skanderbeg's ideological heir, who completes his holy task of guarding the boundaries of Catholicism and Albanianism.

===Serbianization of Skanderbeg===

While Greek references to Skanderbeg were used up, Serbian historians, often contradictorily, used Skanderbeg as a symbol of joint Serbian-Albanian progress (1866).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skënderbeu|year=2008|publisher=K&amp;B|isbn=978-9995666750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RbeSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9789995666750&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3BaTpvRMuzJsQK61bTIDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|accessdate=|page=437|language=Albanian|quote=Ndërkohë që pas 1900-s referimet greke ndaj Skënderbeut erdhën duke u shuar, propagandistët serbë në strategjitë e tyre, shpesh kontradiktore, e përdorën Skënderbeun si simbol të një ecurie të përbashkët serbe-(shqiptare) (1866)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, forty years later, in a different political environment, the faded memory of Skanderbeg among a large portion of Albanians was used as evidence of a lack of an ethnic identity and even the said Serbian character of the medieval hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skënderbeu|year=2008|publisher=K&amp;B|isbn=9789995666750 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RbeSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9789995666750&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3BaTpvRMuzJsQK61bTIDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|accessdate=|page=437|language=Albanian|quote=në anën tjetër, dyzet vjet më vonë, në rrethana të ndryshuara politike, kujtimin e zbehur për Skënderbeun në shtresat e gjera të popullsisë shqiptare si dëshmi për mungesën e ndjenjes së identit etnik madje dhe për gjoja karakterin serb të heroit mesjetar}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiridon Gopčević]], a proponent of Serbian expansion in the Ottoman Balkans, claimed that northern Albanians are actually Serbs and Skanderbeg's main motivation was his feelings of Serb national injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skënderbeu|year=2008|publisher=K&amp;B|isbn=9789995666750 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RbeSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9789995666750&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3BaTpvRMuzJsQK61bTIDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|accessdate=|page=437|language=Albanian|quote=Propagandisti i ekspansionit serb në Ballkanin osman, publicisti Spiridon Gopçeviç, thoshte për shembull se të gjithë shqiptarët e veriut janë në të vërtetë serbë dhe motivi kryesor i veprimit të Skënderbeut ka qenë ndjenja e tij lënduar nacionale serbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Montenegro]], a country which had tribal structures similar to the ones in northern Albania and also had a similar mentality, Skanderbeg was celebrated as a Slavic hero, a concept which was incorporated into the movement to justify an expansion of Montenegro into northern Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skënderbeu|year=2008|publisher=K&amp;B|isbn=9789995666750 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RbeSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9789995666750&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3BaTpvRMuzJsQK61bTIDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|accessdate=|page=437|language=Albanian|quote=Në Malin e Zi, që i kishte strukturat e veta fisnore shumë të ngjashme me ato të Shqipërisë së veriut, çka sillte edhe një afri në mendësi, Skënderbeu u kremtua si ideali i burrërisë heroike, si luftëtar sllav dhe mishërimi i një shtrirjeje politike të Malit të Zi në Arbëri të veriut.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skanderbeg in Greek literature ===
Skanderbeg was a figure featured in 19th century Greek literature.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; Papadopoulo Vretto published a biography on Skanderbeg and presented him as a defender of Christianity against the Muslim Ottomans and a 'proud Epirotan' descendant of king [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] of ancient Epirus.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; The book itself did not claim Skanderbeg as Greek, yet the text became influential in shaping a long tradition within Greek litreture that appropriated him as a Greek national hero and patriot.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; Greek revoltuionaries read the book and commemorated his Skanderbeg actions as ones of Greek and Christian pride.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; At the time as the idea of an Albanian nation consolidated Papadopoulo's book spread to the Arbereshë (Albanian) diaspora of southern Italy and it influenced Italo-Albanian intellectuals who sought to elevate figures such as Skanderbeg as an Albanian hero and differentiate themselves from Greeks.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zanou|first=Konstantina|title=Transnational Patriotism in the Mediterranean, 1800-1850: Stammering the Nation|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198788706|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZflyDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Transnational+Patriotism+in+the+Mediterranean,+1800-1850:+Stammering+the+Nation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2ptjLnrHeAhVIXCsKHT0RB8kQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Skanderbeg&amp;f=false|pages=146-148.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploits of Skanderbeg's figure ===

Skanderbeg's [[name]], [[horse]], and [[sword]] summarize exploits of his figure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=di Miceli |first=Francesca |author2=Zef Chiaramonte |author3=Franca Cuccia |author4=Giuseppe Barbaccia |author5=Ernesto Schiro |title= Miti e Cultura Arbereshe |url= http://www.centrointernazionalestudisulmito.com/ebooks/albanesi.pdf |accessdate= March 24, 2011 |publisher= Centro Internazionale Studi sul Mito Delegazione Siciliana |location= Italy |language= Italian |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |page= 5 |chapter= |quote= Un nome, una spada e un destriero quindi compendiano le gesta di Giorgio Kastriota...Nomen omen ...Infatti come l’eroico macedone Alessandro Magno aveva lottato contro i Greci per proteggere la sua terra così l’albanese Giorgio Kastriota lottava contro i Turci a difesa dell’Albania mettendo ...possedeva poteri magici...ma uno dei ruoli che maggiormente la caratterizza è quello di guida dell’uomo nei mpondi superiori...il suo cavallo e ciò avrebbe scatenato un enorme terrore fra i turchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Nomen est omen]] is used in the exploitation of Skanderbeg's figure by connecting his name with [[Alexander the Great]], who defended his territory, and implying that Skanderbeg also struggled to defend his territory from the [[Ottoman Empire]].
# The sword used by Skanderbeg was a present of the sultan and was endowed with [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers.
# The horse connects the mythological hero with both earthly and spiritual powers, also making the hero look taller. The neighing of Skanderbeg's horse caused terror among his enemies.

At the dawn of the 20th century, the figure of Skanderbeg as the Albanian national hero took another dimension through the appearance of [[pretender]]s to the [[throne]] who claimed his descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Clayer | first = Nathalie | title =Aux origines du nationalisme albanais: la naissance d'une nation| publisher = Karthala |page=441|quote=A l'aube XX siècle, la figure de Skanderbeg comme heros national albanais prit egalement une autre dimension a travers l apparition des pretendants au trone qui se reclamerent de sa descendance. | year = 2007| isbn = 978-2-84586-816-8| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umotBF3KFWgC&amp;pg=PA666&amp;dq=Themistokli+G%C3%ABrmenji&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JGgzTYqHEpPr4gar2PyTCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Themistokli%20G%C3%ABrmenji&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being aware of the myth of Skanderbeg, many pretenders on the Albanian throne, like the German nobleman [[Wilhelm of Wied]] and several European adventurers, named themselves and their descendants after Skanderbeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Jazexhi |first=Olsi |editor= |title=Africana |url=http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/africana/AFR2002.pdf |accessdate= |year=2002 |publisher= Edistudio di Brunetto Casini |location= Pisa, Italy |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |pages=93–101 |chapter=Another approach towards certain ‘exported’ myths on Albanian historiography between Occident and Islâm |chapterurl= |quote=The Europeans that pretended to ... like...

[[Image:eCover of History-Fiction or Science? Chronology 1,2,3 .jpg|thumb|''History: Fiction or Science? Chronology'' volumes 1–7]]

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank
 | title = Der Mythos von der Geburt des Helden | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Fomenko's methods==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

 | chapter = 1. The local maxima method | pages = 187–194
 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compares modern texts which describe different periods, and calculates low correlation, as expected.&lt;ref name=F2/&gt; However, when he compares, for example, the ancient history of Rome and the medieval history of Rome, he calculates a high correlation, and concludes that ancient history of Rome is a copy of medieval history of Rome, thus clashing with mainstream accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. |authorlink= Anatoly Fomenko
 | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1 | pages = 215–223

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г. Каспарова по проблеме «Новой Хронологии»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html "Garry Kasparov and New Chronology"] ''Chess Notes''&lt;/ref&gt; Billington writes that the theory "might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia" if not for Kasparov's writing in support of it in the magazine ''[[Ogoniok]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko's conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that [[Dark Ages (historiography)#Modern popular use|art and culture died during the Dark Ages]] and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

Fomenko).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in that round table, the distinguished Russian archaeologist, [[Valentin Yanin]], compared Fomenko's work to "the sleight of hand trickery of a [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]], [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/janin.htm "Зияющие высоты" академика Фоменко] (The "Gaping Heights" of Academician Fomenko); passage translated in James H. Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A. Graybill, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume25/Number2/azu_radiocarbon_v25_n2_287_288_v.pdf "Dendrochronology of Bristlecone Pine: A Progress Report"], ''Radiocarbon'', 25 (1983): 287-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume24/Number1/azu_radiocarbon_v24_n1_1_26_v.pdf "A High-Precision Calibration of the AD Radiocarbon Time Scale"], ''Radiocarbon'', 24 (1982): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;M.

Furthermore, the mutual consistency of these independent dendrochronological sequences has been confirmed by comparing their radiocarbon and dendrochronological ages.&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume28/Number2B/azu_radiocarbon_v28_n2B_969_979_v.pdf "Radiocarbon Age Calibration back to 13,300 Years BP and the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C Age Matching of the German Oak and US Bristlecone Pine Chronologies"], ''Radiocarbon'', 28 (1986): 969-979.&lt;/ref&gt; These and other data have provided a calibration curve for radiocarbon dating whose internal error does not exceed ±163 years over the entire 26,000 years of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;Paula J. Reimer, ''et al.'', [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume46/Number3/azu_radiocarbon_v46_n3_1029_1058_v.pdf "INTCAL04 Terrestrial Radiocarbon Age Calibration, 0–26 Cal Kyr BP"], ''Radiocarbon'' 46 (2004): 1029-1058; data online at http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal04%20files/intcal04.14c .&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, Küppers M (2004).

F., Orcel, C., Küppers, M. "The 12,460-year Hohenheim Oak and pine tree-ring chronology from central Europe: A unique annual record for radiocarbon calibration and paleoenvironment reconstructions" ''Radiocarbon'' 2004, vol. 46, no3, pp. 1111-1122 [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16599079]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

{{For|the work by H. G. Wells|The Outline of History}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to history:

'''[[History]]''' – discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of information about past events. History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of  [[recorded history]]).


== Nature of history ==
History can be described as all of the following:
* [[Academic discipline]] – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.
** one of the [[humanities]] – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences.
* [[Fields of science|Field of science]]  – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature.  Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published.  There are many sociology-related scientific journals.
** [[Social science]]  – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society.

===Essence of history===
* [[Chronology]] &amp;ndash; science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in [[historical timeline]]s.
* [[Past]] &amp;ndash; totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history.
* [[Time]] &amp;ndash; measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions. History describes what happened where, but also when (in time) those events took place.

== Historical disciplines ==
* [[Archaeology]] – study of past human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data
* [[Archontology]] – study of historical offices and important positions in state, international, political, religious and other organizations and societies
* [[Art history]] – study of changes in and social context of art
* [[Chronology]] – locating events in time
* [[Cultural history]] – study of culture in the past
* [[Diplomatic history]] – study of the historical foreign policy and diplomacy of states 
* [[History of science]] – study of the emergence and development of scientific inquiry
* [[Economic history]] – the study of economics in the past
* [[Environmental history]] – study of natural history and the human relationship with the natural world
* [[Futurology]] – study of the future: researches the medium to long-term future of societies and of the physical world
* [[Historiography]] &amp;ndash; both the study of the methodology of historians and development of history as a discipline, and also to a body of historical work on a particular subject. The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches.
* [[Intellectual history]]
* [[History painter|History painting]] – painting of works of art having historical motifs or depicting great events
* [[Military history]] – study of warfare and wars in history
* [[Naval history]] – branch of military history devoted to warfare at sea or in bodies of water
* [[Paleography]] – study of ancient texts
* [[Philosophy of history]] &amp;ndash;
* [[Political history]] – study of past political events, ideas, movements, and leaders
* [[Public history]] – presentation of history to public audiences and other areas typically outside academia
* [[Psychohistory]] – study of the psychological motivations of historical events
* [[Social history]] – study of societies and social trends in the past
* [[Universal history]] – study of trends and dynamics in world history
* [[Urban history]] – historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization
* [[Women's history]] – study of the roles of women throughout history 
* [[World history]] – study of global or transnational historical patterns

{{See also|epistemological break}}

A '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning, as "example".

The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase "revolution of the way of thinking" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). As one commentator summarizes:

{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.

== Kuhnian paradigm shifts ==
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An [[epistemology|epistemological]] paradigm shift  was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and [[history of science|historian of science]] Thomas Kuhn in his book ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire [[World view|worldview]] in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.

There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject [[Karl Popper]]'s model of [[falsifiability]] as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|Mercury's perihelion]] more troubling than the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the [[logical positivists]] in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.

When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of ''crisis,'' according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a ''new'' paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwellian]] [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic worldview]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from [[Max Planck]]: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a ''scientific revolution'' or a ''paradigm shift''. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term ''paradigm shift'' is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.

In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn,&lt;ref&gt;''Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything'', Imprint Academic 2015, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.

== Science and paradigm shift ==

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305–20. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "''On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme''" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. 

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p.&amp;nbsp;12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{See also|Science and Theosophy#New paradigm}}

== Examples of paradigm shifts ==

=== Natural sciences ===
Some of the "classical cases" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:

* 1543 – The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1543 – The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98–112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1687 – The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1783 – The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm Shifts: Technology &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1826 – The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|date=1987|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1859 – The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].
* 1905 – The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83–84, 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1887 to 1905 – The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1919 – The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[General Relativity]].

=== Social sciences ===
In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuhn | first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= 6 |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.
* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Laidler]]. ''Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Say's Law]] dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John Kenneth |year=1975 |title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went |page=223 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-19843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzdkAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, [[John A. Hobson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money |page=366 |quote=Mr. Hobson has flung himself with unflagging, but almost unavailing, ardour and courage against the ranks of orthodoxy. Though it is so completely forgotten to-day, the publication of this book marks, in a sense, an epoch in economic thought. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.
* Later, the movement for [[monetarism]] over [[Keynesian]]ism marked a second divisive shift. Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing [[inflation]], that it was solely a monetary phenomenon, in contrast to the [[Keynesian]] view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important.  Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the [[quantity theory of money]] and shifting [[Phillips curve]], theories they initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., Schwartz, Anna J. (2008). [https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/08/09/Bordo.pdf Monetary Economic Research at the St. Louis Fed During Ted Balbach's Tenure as Research Director]. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ''Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in 1879, the [[laryngeal theory]] in [[Indo-European linguistics]] postulated the existence of "laryngeal" consonants in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the [[Hittite language]] in the early 20th century. The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists, paving the way for the [[internal reconstruction]] of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo European Linguistics: An Introduction|author=James Clackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied sciences ===
More recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|pages=68–89|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a [[buzzword]], popularized as [[marketing speak]] and appearing more frequently in print and publication.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999). http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Mind The Gaffe'', author [[Larry Trask]] advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase.  It is referred to in several articles and books&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6275610-1.html Cnet.com's Top 10 Buzzwords]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete Idiot's Guide to A Smart Vocabulary"&gt;[http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp "The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142–43, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012026/http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp |date=December 15, 2007 }} {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.

== Other uses ==
The term "paradigm shift" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:
* M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.&lt;ref http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/779.full.pdf&gt;2009. "Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185–202&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two photographs of the Earth from space, "[[Earthrise]]" (1968) and "[[The Blue Marble]]" (1972), are thought to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher H. "Global Warming and the Problem of Policy Innovation: Lessons from the Early Environmental Movement". 2009. http://www.lclark.edu/org/envtl/objects/39-2_Schroeder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Stewart Brand#NASA image of Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Küng]] applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Hans &amp; Tracy, David (ed). ''Paradigm Change in Theology''. New York: Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''.&lt;ref&gt;Küng, Hans. ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''. New York: Anchor Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact''' theories relate to visits or interactions with the [[Americas]] and/or [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by  people from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], or [[Oceania]] before [[Columbus's first voyage]] to the [[Caribbean]] in 1492.&lt;ref name="RileyKelley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carroll L.

Two historical cases of pre-Columbian contact are accepted amongst the scientific and scholarly mainstream. Successful explorations led to [[History of Greenland#Norse settlement|Norse settlement of Greenland]] and the [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] settlement in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]&lt;ref name="CordellLightfoot2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda S.

The scientific and scholarly responses to other post-[[prehistory]], pre-Columbian contact claims have varied. Some such contact claims are examined in reputable peer-reviewed sources. Other contact claims, typically based on circumstantial and ambiguous interpretations of archaeological finds, cultural comparisons, comments in historical documents, and narrative accounts, have been dismissed as [[fringe science]] or [[pseudoarcheology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Beck Kehoe]] (2003)[http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_17_1_kehoe.pdf The Fringe of American Archaeology: Transoceanic and Transcontinental Contacts in Prehistoric America].

[[Vikings |Norse]] journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence. A Norse colony in [[Greenland]] was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (''[[Thing (assembly)|þing]]'') taking place at [[Brattahlíð]] and a bishop at [[Gardar, Greenland|Garðar]].&lt;ref name="WurmMühlhäusler1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Few sources describing contact between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and Norse people exist. Contact between the [[Thule people]] (ancestors of the modern [[Inuit]]) and Norse between the 12th or 13th centuries is known. The Norse Greenlanders called these incoming settlers "[[skræling]]ar". Conflict between the Greenlanders and the "skrælings" is recorded in the ''[[Icelandic Annals]]''. The term skrælings is also used in the Vínland sagas, which relate to events during the 10th century, when describing trade and conflict with native peoples.&lt;ref name="Seaver2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirsten A.

== Claims of Polynesian contact ==

=== Claims involving sweet potato ===
The [[sweet potato]], which is native to the Americas, was widespread in [[Polynesia]] when Europeans first reached the Pacific. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the [[Cook Islands]] to 1000 CE, and current thinking is that it was brought to central Polynesia c. 700 CE and spread across [[Polynesia]] from there.&lt;ref&gt;Van Tilburg, Jo Anne. 1994. Easter Island: Archaeology, Ecology and Culture. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langdon | first1 = Robert | year = 2001 | title = The Bamboo Raft as a Key to the Introduction of the Sweet Potato in Prehistoric Polynesia | url = | journal = The Journal of Pacific History | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 51–76| doi=10.1080/00223340123312}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was brought by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, or that South Americans brought it to the Pacific.

=== Claims involving Peruvian mummies ===
A team of academics headed by the [[University of York]]'s Mummy Research Group and BioArch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/magazine/aprilmag08.pdf |title=28801_April08.indd |publisher=York.ac.uk |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while examining a Peruvian mummy at the [[Bolton Museum]], found that it had been embalmed using a tree [[resin]].  Before this it was thought that Peruvian mummies were naturally preserved. The resin, found to be that of an ''[[Araucaria]]'' [[Pinophyta|conifer]] related to the [[Araucaria araucana|'monkey puzzle tree']], was from a variety found only in [[Oceania]] and probably [[New Guinea]]. "Radiocarbon dating of both the resin and body by the University of Oxford's radiocarbon laboratory confirmed they were essentially contemporary, and date to around CE 1200."&lt;ref&gt;From the University of York Magazine, page 9, April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving California canoes ===
[[File:Chumash Tomol 'Elye'wun paddlers, CINMS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''‘Elye’wun'', a reconstructed Chumash [[tomol]]]]
Researchers including Kathryn Klar and Terry Jones have proposed a theory of contact between Hawaiians and the [[Chumash people]] of [[Southern California]] between 400 and 800 CE. The sewn-plank canoes crafted by the Chumash and neighboring [[Tongva people|Tongva]] are unique among the indigenous peoples of North America, but similar in design to larger canoes used by Polynesians for deep-sea voyages. ''[[Tomol|Tomolo'o]]'', the [[Chumash language|Chumash]] word for such a craft, may derive from ''kumula'au'', the Hawaiian term for the logs from which shipwrights carve planks to be sewn into canoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/20/MNG9GDBBLG1.DTL Did ancient Polynesians visit California?

=== Claims involving chickens ===
The existence of chicken bones dating from 1321 to 1407 in Chile and thought to be genetically linked to South Pacific Island chicken landraces suggested further evidence of South Pacific contact with South America. The genetic link between the South American [[Mapuche]] (to whom the chickens were thought to originally belong)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0801/topten/chicken.html|title=Top 10 Discoveries of 2007 – Polynesian Chickens in Chile – Archaeology Magazine Archive|work=archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; chicken bones and South Pacific Island species has been rejected by a more recent genetic study which concluded that "The analysis of ancient and modern specimens reveals a unique Polynesian genetic signature" and that "a previously reported connection between pre-European South America and Polynesian chickens most likely resulted from contamination with modern DNA, and that this issue is likely to confound ancient DNA studies involving haplogroup E chicken sequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=Vicki A|first2=Ophélie |last2=Lebrasseur |first3=Jeremy J. |last3=Austin |first4=Terry L. |last4=Hunt |first5=David A. |last5=Burney |first6=Tim |last6=Denham |first7=Nicolas J. |last7=Rawlence |first8=Jamie R. |last8=Wood |first9=Jaime |last9=Gongor |first10=Linus Girdland |last10=Flink |first11=Anna |last11=Linderholm |first12=Keith |last12=Dobney |first13=Greger |last13=Larson |first14=Alan |last14=Cooper|title=Using ancient DNA to study the origins and dispersal of ancestral Polynesian chickens across the Pacific|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=April 1, 2014|volume=111|issue=13|pages=4826–4831|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320412111|pmid=24639505|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/13/4826.full |pmc=3977275|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.4826T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken bones found at the site [[El Arenal, Chile|El Arenal]] in the [[Araucanía (historic region)|Arauco Peninsula]], an area inhabited by Mapuche, support a pre-Columbian introduction of [[Araucana chicken|chicken]] to South America.&lt;ref&gt;Storey et al., p. 10335.&lt;/ref&gt; The bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, before the arrival of the Spanish.

=== Linguistics ===
[[File:Thames Kumara n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sweet potatoes for sale, Thames, New Zealand. The name "kumara" has entered [[New Zealand English]] from [[Māori language|Māori]], and is in wide use.]]

Dutch linguists and specialists in [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] [[Willem Adelaar]] and Pieter Muysken have suggested that two lexical items may be shared by Polynesian languages and languages of South America. One is the name of the [[#Claims involving sweet potato|sweet potato]], which was domesticated in the New World. [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''kumala''&lt;ref name=POLLEX-kumala&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|last3=Biggs|first3=Bruce|title=Entries for KUMALA.1 [LO] Sweet Potato (Ipomoea)|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/kumala1/|work=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Rapa Nui language|Easter Island]] ''kumara'', [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''ʻuala'',&lt;!--this is correct. an [m] was not dropped.--&gt; [[Māori language|Māori]] ''kumāra''; apparent [[cognate]]s outside [[Eastern Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesian]] may be [[Loanword|borrowed]] from Eastern Polynesian languages, calling Proto-Polynesian status and age into question) may be connected with [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] ''k’umar ~ k’umara''. A possible second is the word for 'stone axe', Easter Island ''toki'', New Zealand Maori ''toki'' 'adze', [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] ''toki'', and further afield, [[Yurumanguí language|Yurumanguí]] ''totoki'' 'axe'. According to Adelaar and Muysken, the similarity in the word for sweet potato "constitutes near proof of incidental contact between inhabitants of the Andean region and the South Pacific", though according to Adelaar and Muysken the word for axe is not as convincing. The authors argue that the presence of the word for sweet potato suggests sporadic contact between Polynesia and South America, but no migrations.&lt;ref&gt;"Genetic relations of South American Indian languages".

=== Similarity of features and genetics ===
[[File:Isla Mocha 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mocha Island]] off the coast of [[Arauco Peninsula]], Chile]]
In December 2007, several human skulls  were found  in a museum in [[Concepción, Chile]].  These skulls  originated from [[Mocha Island]], an island just off the coast of Chile in the Pacific Ocean, formerly inhabited by the Mapuche. [[craniometry|Craniometric]] analysis of the skulls, according to [[Lisa Matisoo-Smith]] of the [[University of Otago]] and [[José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga]] of the [[Universidad de Valparaíso]], suggests that the skulls have "[[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] features" – such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, and rocker jaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lawler |first1= Andrew |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5984/1344.full |title=Beyond ''Kon-Tiki'': Did Polynesians Sail to South America?|journal=Science|date= June 11, 2010 |pages= 1344–1347 | pmid=20538927 | doi=10.1126/science.328.5984.1344 | volume=328 | issue=5984 |bibcode= 2010Sci...328.1344L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 to 2009, geneticist [[Erik Thorsby]] and colleagues have published two studies in  ''[[Tissue Antigens]]'' that evidence an Amerindian genetic contribution to the Easter Island population, determining that it was probably introduced before European discovery of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00717.x |title= Molecular genetic studies of natives on Easter Island: evidence of an early European and Amerindian contribution to the Polynesian gene pool | year = 2007 | last1 = Lie | first1 = B.

In 2014, geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of The Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen published a study in ''[[Current Biology]]'' that found human genetic evidence of contact between the populations of [[Easter Island]] and South America, approximately 600 years ago (i.e. 1400 CE ± 100 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Westerholm|first1=Russell|title=Easter Island Was Not Populated Solely by the Polynesians, According to New Genetic Study|url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/12415/20141024/easter-island-was-not-populated-solely-by-the-polynesians-according-to-new-genetic-study.htm|website=University Herald|accessdate=2014-12-24|date=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the now extinct [[Aimoré people|Botocudo people]], who lived in the interior of Brazil, were found in research published in 2013 to have been members of [[mtDNA haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)#Tree|B4a1a1]], which is normally found only among Polynesians and other subgroups of [[Austronesian people|Austronesians]]. This was based on an analysis of fourteen skulls. Two belonged to B4a1a1 (while twelve belonged to subclades of mtDNA  [[haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C1]] common among Native Americans). The research team examined various scenarios, none of which they could say for certain were correct. They dismissed a scenario of direct contact in prehistory between Polynesia and Brazil as "too unlikely to be seriously entertained." While B4a1a1 is also found among the [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] (which experienced significant Austronesian settlement in prehistory), the authors described as "fanciful" suggestions that B4a1a1 among the Botocudo resulted from  the African slave trade (which included Madagascar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vanessa Faria Gonçalves |author2=Jesper Stenderup |author3=Cláudia Rodrigues-Carvalho |author4=Hilton P.

=== Claims of Chinese contact ===

Other researchers have argued that the [[Olmec]] civilization came into existence with the help of [[China|Chinese]] refugees, particularly at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;This theory is mentioned in the history book [[The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community]] (1963) by [[William Hardy McNeill|William H.

Other claims have been made for early Chinese contact with North America.

In 1882 artifacts identified at the time as Chinese coins were discovered in British Columbia. A contemporary account states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dean|first=James|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|date=January 1884|pages=98–99|volume=18|issue=1|jstor=2450831|doi=10.1086/273578|title=Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the summer of 1882 a miner found on De Foe (Deorse?) creek, Cassiar district, Br. Columbia, thirty Chinese coins in the auriferous sand, twenty-five feet below the surface. They appeared to have been strung, but on taking them up the miner let them drop apart. The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar. So far as I can make out the markings, this is a Chinese chronological cycle of sixty years, invented by [[Yellow Emperor|Emperor Huungti]], 2637 BCE, and circulated in this form to make his people remember it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 1885, a vase containing similar discs was also discovered, wrapped in the roots of a tree around 300 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chow|first=Lily|title=Chasing their dreams : Chinese settlement in the Northwest region of British Columbia = Zhui qun meng xiang|year=2000|publisher=Caitlin Press|location=Prince George, B.C.|isbn=978-0-920576-83-0|chapter=The Gold Fever|chapterurl=http://caitlin-press.com/our-books/chasing-their-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grant Keddie, Curator of Archeology at the Royal BC Museum, examined a photograph of a coin from Cassiar taken in the 1940s (whereabouts now unknown) and he believes that the character style and the evidence that it was machine-ground show it to be a 19th-century copy of a [[Ming Dynasty]] temple token.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Washington Indian socio-economics: papers in honor of Angelo Anastasio|year=1984|publisher=Western Washington University|page=172|author=Megan Merry McCormick|editor=Herbert C Taylor and Garland F Grabert|chapter=Chinese Coins and Pre-Columbian Asian Contacts with the Pacific Northwest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Chinese Buddhist missionaries led by [[Hui Shen]] before 500 CE claimed to have visited a location called [[Fusang]].

In 1973 and 1975 doughnut-shaped stones were discovered off the coast of California that resembled stone anchors used by Chinese fishermen. These (sometimes called the ''Palos Verdes stones'') were initially thought to be up to 1500 years old and proof of pre-Columbian contact by Chinese sailors. Later geological investigations showed them to be a local rock known as [[Monterey Formation|Monterey shale]], and they are thought to have been used by Chinese settlers fishing off the coast in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder|Feder, Kenneth L.]] (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum''. Westport, CN: Greenwood. page 209. {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, [[Purdue University]] published the results of research on six metal and composite metal artifacts excavated from a late prehistoric archaeological context at [[Cape Espenberg]] on the northern coast of the [[Seward Peninsula]] in [[Alaska]]. Also part of the research team was [[Robert J. Speakman]], of the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the [[University of Georgia]], and [[Victor Mair]], of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The report is the first evidence that metal from Asia reached prehistoric North America before the contact with Europeans, stating that [[X-ray fluorescence]] identified two of these artifacts as smelted industrial alloys with large proportions of tin and lead. The presence of smelted alloys in a prehistoric Inuit context in northwest Alaska was  demonstrated  for the first time and indicates the movement of Eurasian metal across the Bering Strait into North America before sustained contact with Europeans.
{{bquote|This is not a surprise based on oral history and other archaeological finds, and it was just a matter of time before we had a good example of Eurasian metal that had been traded [...] We believe these smelted alloys were made somewhere in Eurasia and traded to Siberia and then traded across the Bering Strait to ancestral {{sic|Inuits}} people, also known as Thule culture, in Alaska. Locally available metal in parts of the Arctic, such as native metal, copper and meteoritic and telluric iron were used by ancient Inuit people for tools and to sometimes indicate status. Two of the Cape Espenberg items that were found – a bead and a buckle — are heavily leaded bronze artifacts. Both are from a house at the site dating to the Late Prehistoric Period, around 1100-1300 AD, which is before sustained European contact in the late 18th century. [...] The belt buckle also is considered an industrial product and is an unprecedented find for this time. It resembles a buckle used as part of a horse harness that would have been used in north-central China during the first six centuries before the Common Era.|author=H.

=== Claims of Japanese contact ===
[[Image:Otokichi.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otokichi]], a Japanese castaway in America in 1834, depicted here in 1849.]]
Smithsonian archaeologist [[Betty Meggers]] wrote that pottery associated with the [[Valdivia culture]] of coastal Ecuador dated to 3000–1500 BCE exhibited similarities to pottery produced during the [[Jōmon period]] in [[Japan]], arguing that contact between the two cultures might explain the similarities. Chronological and other problems have led most archaeologists to dismiss this idea as implausible.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia, Jomon Fishermen, and the Nature of the North Pacific: Some Nautical Problems with Meggers, Evans, and Estrada's (1965) Transoceanic Contact Thesis Gordon F. McEwan, D. Bruce Dickson American Antiquity, Vol. 43, No. 3 (Jul. 1978), pp. 362–371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistory of the Americas'' By Stuart J. Fiedel pp 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion has been made that the resemblances (which are not complete) are simply due to the limited number of designs possible when incising clay.

Alaskan anthropologist Nancy Yaw Davis claims that the [[Zuni people]] of [[New Mexico]] exhibit linguistic and cultural similarities to the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Zuni"&gt;Davis, Nancy Yaw (200). ''The Zuni Enigma''. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32230-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-393-32230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zuni language]] is a [[language isolate|linguistic isolate]], and Davis contends that the culture appears to differ from that of the surrounding natives in terms of blood type, [[endemic disease]], and religion. Davis speculates that [[Buddhist]] priests or restless peasants from Japan may have crossed the Pacific in the 13th century, traveled to the [[American Southwest]], and influenced Zuni society.&lt;ref name="Zuni" /&gt;

In the 1890s, lawyer and politician [[James Wickersham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wickersham, James (1892). "Origin of the Indians--The Polynesian Route." ''American Antiquarian'', 16:323-335, partly reprinted in [[William R. Corliss]], ed. (1978) ''Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts'', Glen Arm, Maryland: Sourcebook Project, {{ISBN|0-915554-03-8}} pp. 705-709&lt;/ref&gt; argued that pre-Columbian contact between Japanese sailors and Native Americans was highly probable, given that from the early 17th century to the mid-19th century several dozen Japanese ships were carried from Asia to North America along the powerful [[Kuroshio Current]]s. Such Japanese ships landed from the [[Aleutian Islands]] in the north to [[Mexico]] in the south, carrying a total of 293 persons in the 23 cases where head-counts were given in historical records. In most cases, the Japanese sailors gradually made their way home on merchant vessels. In 1834 a dismasted, rudderless Japanese ship crashed near [[Cape Flattery]]. Three survivors of the ship were enslaved by [[Makah people|Makahs]] for a period before being rescued by members of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. They were never able to return to their homeland due to Japan's isolationist policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/9065|title=Japanese Castaways of 1834: The Three Kichis - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/japanese-retrace-path-history-making-castaways-180-years-later|title=Japanese Retrace Path Of History-Making Castaways, 180 Years Later|last=Banse|first=Tom|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Japanese ship crashed in about 1850 near the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Wickersham writes, and the sailors were assimilated into the local Native American population. While admitting there was no definitive proof of pre-Columbian contact between Japanese and North Americans, Wickersham thought it implausible that such contacts as outlined above would have started only after Europeans arrived in North America.

== Claims of Indian contact ==
In 1879, [[Alexander Cunningham]] described the carvings on the Stupa of [[Bharhut]] from c. 200 BCE and described some fruit like detail as a custard-apple (''[[Annona squamosa]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Stupa of Bharhut| author=Cunningham, Alexander| year=1879| publisher=W.H.Allen| place=London|url=https://archive.org/stream/stpabharhutabud00offigoog#page/n58/mode/2up/| page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wasn't aware that botanists believed this plant to be indigenous only in the Americas, but others quickly pointed out the difficulty, as it was generally believed that the custard-apple had not been brought to India before Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route in 1498.

The Olmec culture existed from roughly 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. The idea that the Olmecs are related to Africans was suggested by José Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar, Jose (1869) "Antigüedades mexicanas, notable escultura antigua", in ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'', época 2, vol. 1, pp. 292–297, Mexico, as well as Melgar, Jose (1871) "Estudio sobre la antigüedad y el origen de la Cabeza Colosal de tipo etiópico que existe en Hueyapan del cantón de los Tuxtlas" in ''Boletín de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística'', época 2, vol. 3, pp. 104–109; Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Ivan Van Sertima]] has argued that these statues depict settlers or explorers from Africa, but his views have been the target of severe scholarly criticism.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/vansertima.pdf CA Forum on Anthropology in Public: Robbing Native Cultures: Van Sertima's Afrocentricity and the Olmecs]," in ''Current Anthropology'', Vol. 38, no. 3 (June 1997), 419-441&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Wiener]]'s "Africa and the Discovery of America" suggests similarities between [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and native Mesoamerican religious symbols such as the winged serpent and the sun disk, or Quetzalcoatl, and words that have Mande roots and share similar meanings across both cultures such as "kore", "gadwal", and "qubila" (in Arabic) or "kofila" (in Mandinka). &lt;ref&gt;Leo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, Philadelphia, p259, Inness and Sons, 1922, Vol 3 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Leo Wiener, Africa and the Discovery of America, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1921), pp. 83-94 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solutrean hypothesis ===
{{Main article|Solutrean hypothesis}}
[[Image:Arch1 clovispoints2.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of Clovis and other Paleoindian point forms, markers of archaeological cultures in northeastern North America]]
The [[Solutrean hypothesis]] argues that Europeans migrated to the New World during the [[Paleolithic]] era, circa 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. This hypothesis proposes contact partly on the basis of perceived similarities between the flint tools of the [[Solutrean culture]] in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal (which thrived circa 20,000 to 15,000 BCE), and the [[Clovis culture]] of North America, which developed circa 9000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this study, we identified and completely sequenced 14 mitochondrial DNAs belonging to one extremely rare Native American lineage known as haplogroup C4c. Its age and geographical distribution raise the possibility that C4c marked the Paleo-Indian group(s) that entered North America from Beringia through the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims involving ancient Roman contact ===

Evidence of contacts with the civilizations of [[Classical Antiquity]]—primarily with the [[Roman Empire]], but sometimes also with other cultures of the age—have been based on isolated archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World. The Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble [[Amphora#Ancient Rome|Roman amphorae]]&lt;ref&gt;http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?type=related&amp;kv=87136&amp;t=objects&lt;/ref&gt; for over 150 years. It has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a Roman wreck, although it has been suggested that they could be 15th or 16th century Spanish olive oil jars.

Romeo Hristov argues that a Roman ship, or the drifting of such a shipwreck to the American shores, is a possible explanation of archaeological finds (like the Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca bearded head) from ancient Rome in America. Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidences of travels from Romans to [[Tenerife]] and [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) on [[Lanzarote|Lanzarote island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hristov|first1=Romeo H.|last2=Genovés T.|first2=Santiago|year=1999|title=Mesoamerica evidence of pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=10|pages=207–213|doi=10.1017/S0956536199102013|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:0 Mosaico pavimentale – Grotte Celloni – Pal. Massimo.JPG|thumb|Floor mosaic depicting a fruit which looks like a pineapple. Opus vermiculatum, Roman artwork of the end of the 1st century BC/begin of the 1st century AD.]]

In 1950, an Italian botanist, Domenico Casella, suggested that a depiction of a [[pineapple]] was represented among wall paintings of Mediterranean fruits at [[Pompeii]]. According to [[Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski]], this interpretation has been challenged by other botanists, who identify it as a pine [[conifer cone|cone]] from the [[Stone Pine|Umbrella pine tree]], which is native to the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jashemski |first=Wilhelmina |title=The natural history of Pompeii |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-80054-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3xfjyTqqR7IC&amp;pg=PA81 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head ====
{{See also|Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca head}}

A small [[terracotta]] head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 (in the [[Toluca Valley]], 72 kilometres southwest of [[Mexico City]]) in a burial offering under three intact floors of a [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|pre-colonial]] building dated to between 1476 and 1510. The artifact has been studied by Roman art authority Bernard Andreae, director emeritus of the German Institute of Archaeology in Rome, Italy, and Austrian anthropologist [[Robert von Heine-Geldern]], both of whom stated that the style of the artifact was compatible with small Roman sculptures of the 2nd century. If genuine and if not placed there after 1492 (the pottery found with it dates to between 1476 and 1510)&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Jack D. ''The American Discovery of Europe'' University of Illinois Press;  April 16, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-252-03152-6}} p.108&lt;/ref&gt; the find provides evidence for at least a one-time contact between the Old and New Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Hristov and Genovés (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arizona State University|ASU]]'s Michael E. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/"&lt;/ref&gt; John Paddock, a leading Mesoamerican scholar, used to tell his classes in the years before he died that the artifact was planted as a joke by Hugo Moedano, a student who originally worked on the site. Despite speaking with individuals who knew the original discoverer (García Payón), and Moedano, Smith says he has been unable to confirm or reject this claim. Though he remains skeptical, Smith concedes he cannot rule out the possibility that the head was a genuinely buried Post-classic offering at Calixtlahuaca.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E., "[http://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/tval/RomanFigurine.html The 'Roman Figurine' Supposedly Excavated at Calixtlahuaca]".

Henry was the grandfather of [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]], the builder of [[Rosslyn Chapel]] (near [[Edinburgh]], Scotland).

Fair Winds Press, 2001 {{ISBN|1-931412-75-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This crop was unknown in Europe at the time of the chapel's construction, and was not cultivated there until several hundred years later. Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that Henry Sinclair travelled to the Americas well before Columbus. In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of the botanist Adrian Dyer, and that Dyer's wife told him that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate.&lt;ref name="THK"/&gt; In fact Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the "maize" and "aloe" were stylized wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turnbull|first1=Michael TRB|title=Rosslyn Chapel|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/places/rosslynchapel_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialists in medieval architecture interpret these carvings as stylised depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Oxbrow &amp; I.

Some have conjectured that Columbus was able to persuade the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] to support his planned voyage only because they were aware of some recent earlier voyage across the Atlantic. Some suggest that Columbus himself visited Canada or Greenland before 1492, because according to [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] he wrote he had sailed 100 leagues past an island he called [[Thule]] in 1477. Whether he actually did this and what island he visited, if any, is uncertain. Columbus is thought to have visited [[Bristol]] in 1476.&lt;ref&gt;"It is most probable that Columbus visited Bristol, where he was introduced to English commerce with Iceland." [[Silvio Bedini|Bedini, Silvio A.]] and David Buisseret (1992). ''The Christopher Columbus encyclopedia, Volume 1'', University of Michigan press, republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-13-142670-2}}, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol was also the port from which [[John Cabot]] sailed in 1497, crewed mostly by Bristol sailors. In a letter of late 1497 or early 1498 the English merchant John Day wrote to Columbus about Cabot's discoveries, saying that land found by Cabot was "discovered in the past by the men from Bristol who found 'Brasil' as your lordship knows".&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995) p.222&lt;/ref&gt; There may be records of expeditions from [[Bristol]] to find the "[[Brazil (mythical island)|isle of Brazil]]" in 1480 and 1481.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver, K.A.(1995) ''The Frozen Echo'' Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-3161-6}} p.221&lt;/ref&gt; Trade between Bristol and Iceland is well documented from the mid 15th century.

[[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]] records several such legends in his ''General y natural historia de las Indias'' of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus. He discusses the then-current story of a Spanish caravel that was swept off its course while on its way to England, and wound up in a foreign land populated by naked tribesmen. The crew gathered supplies and made its way back to Europe, but the trip took several months and the captain and most of the men died before reaching land. The ship's pilot, a man called [[Alonso Sánchez]],  and very few others finally made it to Portugal, but all were very ill. Columbus was a good friend of the pilot, and took him to be treated in his own house, and the pilot described the land they had seen and marked it on a map before dying. People in Oviedo's time knew this story in several versions, but Oviedo regarded it as myth.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus, Christopher; Cohen, J. M. (translator) (May 5, 1992). ''The Four Voyages'', pp. 27–37.

In 1925, Soren Larsen wrote a book claiming that a joint Danish-Portuguese expedition landed in Newfoundland or Labrador in 1473 and again in 1476. Larsen claimed that [[Didrik Pining]] and [[Hans Pothorst]] served as captains, while [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] and the possibly mythical [[John Scolvus]] served as navigators, accompanied by [[Álvaro Martins]].&lt;ref&gt;Soren, Larsen.

[[File:Saint brendan german manuscript.jpg|thumb|Saint Brendan and the whale. From a 15th-century manuscript.]]
The legend of Saint [[Brendan]], an Irish monk, involves a fantastical journey into the Atlantic Ocean in search of Paradise in the 6th century.  Since the discovery of the New World, various authors have tried to link the Brendan legend with an early discovery of America. In 1977 The voyage was successfully recreated by [[Tim Severin]] using an ancient Irish [[Currach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/16/did-st-brendan-reach-north-america-500-years-before-the-vikings/|title=Did St. Brendan Reach North America 500 Years Before the Vikings? – National Geographic Society (blogs)|first=Andrew|last=Howley|website=voices.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British myth, [[Madoc]] was a prince from Wales who explored the Americas as early as 1170. While most scholars consider this legend to be untrue, it was used as justification for British claims to the Americas, based on the notion of a Briton arriving before other European nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Gwyn A (1979): ''Madoc: The Making of a Myth''.

== Claims of trans-oceanic travel originating from the New World ==

=== Claims of Egyptian coca and tobacco ===
[[File:RAMmummy.jpg|right|thumb|The [[mummy]] of [[Ramesses II]]]]

Traces of [[coca]] and [[nicotine]] found in some Egyptian mummies have led to speculation that [[Ancient Egyptians]] may have had contact with the New World. The initial discovery was made by a German [[toxicologist]], Svetlana Balabanova, after examining the mummy of a priestess called [[Henut Taui]]. Follow-up tests of the hair shaft, performed to rule out contamination, gave the same results.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/ethnic/mummy.htm"&lt;/ref&gt;

A television show reported that examination of numerous [[Sudan|Sudanese]] mummies undertaken by Balabanova mirrored what was found in the mummy of Henut Taui.&lt;ref name="Curseof"&gt;"Curse of the Cocaine Mummies" written and directed by Sarah Marris. (Producers: Hilary Lawson, Maureen Lemire and narrated by Hilary Kilberg). A TVF Production for Channel Four in association with the Discovery Channel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Balabanova suggested that the tobacco may be accounted for since it may have also been known in China and Europe, as indicated by analysis run on human remains from those respective regions. Balabanova proposed that such plants native to the general area may have developed independently, but have since gone extinct.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt; Other explanations include fraud, though curator Alfred Grimm of the Egyptian Museum in [[Munich]] disputes this.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Skeptical of Balabanova's findings, Rosalie David, Keeper of Egyptology at the [[Manchester Museum]], had similar tests performed on samples taken from the Manchester mummy collection and reported that two of the tissue samples and one hair sample did test positive for nicotine.&lt;ref name="Curseof" /&gt;  Sources of nicotine other than tobacco and sources of cocaine in the Old World are discussed by the British biologist Duncan Edlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=A look at the Evidence for Cocaine in Mummies |publisher=Thehallofmaat.com |accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholars remain skeptical, and they do not see this as proof of ancient contact between Africa and the Americas, especially because there may be possible Old World sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=45 |title=The Stoned Age? |publisher=Hall of Maat |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckland | first1 = P.C. | last2 = Panagiotakopulu | first2 = E | title = Rameses II and the tobacco beetle | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 75 | issue = 549–56| page = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two attempts to replicate Balabanova's finds of cocaine failed, suggesting "that either Balabanova and her associates are misinterpreting their results or that the samples of mummies tested by them have been mysteriously exposed to cocaine."&lt;ref&gt;Counsell, D.

A re-examination in the 1970s of the mummy of [[Ramesses II]] revealed the presence of fragments of tobacco leaves in its abdomen. This became a popular topic in fringe literature and the media and was seen as proof of contact between Ancient Egypt and the New World. The investigator, [[Maurice Bucaille]], noted that when the mummy was unwrapped in 1886 the abdomen was left open and that "it was no longer possible to attach any importance to the presence inside the abdominal cavity of whatever material was found there, since the material could have come from the surrounding environment."&lt;ref&gt;Bucaille, M. ''Mummies of the Pharaohs: Modern Medical Investigations'' NY: St. Martin’s Press pp 186-188&lt;/ref&gt; Following the renewed discussion of tobacco sparked by Balabanova's research and its mention in a 2000 publication by Rosalie David, a study in the journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' suggested that reports of both tobacco and cocaine in mummies "ignored their post-excavation histories" and pointed out that the mummy of Ramesses II had been moved five times between 1883 and 1975.&lt;ref name="Buckland" /&gt;

=== Icelander DNA finding ===
In 2010 Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir published a genetic study showing that over 350 living Icelanders carried mitochondrial DNA of a new type that is similar to the type found only in Native American and East Asian populations. Using the [[deCODE genetics]] database, Sigríður Sunna determined that the DNA entered the Icelandic population not later than 1700, and likely several centuries earlier.  However Sigríður Sunna also states that "...while a Native American origin seems most likely for [this new haplogroup], an Asian or European origin cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21419|pmid=21069749|title=A new subclade of mtDNA haplogroup C1 found in icelanders: Evidence of pre-columbian contact?|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=144|issue=1|pages=92–9|year=2011|last1=Ebenesersdóttir|first1=Sigríður Sunna|last2=Sigurðsson|first2=Ásgeir|last3=Sánchez-Quinto|first3=Federico|last4=Lalueza-Fox|first4=Carles|last5=Stefánsson|first5=Kári|last6=Helgason|first6=Agnar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norse legends and sagas ===
[[Image:Thorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|thumb|150px|Statue of Thorfinn Karlsefni.]]
In 1009, legends report that Norse explorer [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] abducted two children from [[Markland]], an area on the North American mainland where Norse explorers visited but did not settle. The two children were then taken to Greenland, where they were baptized and taught to speak Norse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17946/17946-h/17946-h.htm Eirik the Red's Saga by John Sephton] paragraph 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1420, Danish geographer [[Claudius Clavus Swart]] wrote that he personally had seen "[[pygmies]]" from Greenland who were caught by Norsemen in a small skin boat. Their boat was hung in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]] along with another, longer boat also taken from "pygmies". Clavus Swart's description fits the Inuit and two of their types of boats, the [[kayak]] and the [[umiak]].&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA /&gt; Similarly, the Swedish clergyman [[Olaus Magnus]] wrote in 1505 that he saw in [[Oslo Cathedral]] two leather boats taken decades earlier. According to Olaus, the boats were captured from Greenland pirates by one of the [[Haakon (disambiguation)|Haakons]], which would place the event in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=ADE163 /&gt;

In [[Ferdinand Columbus]]'s biography of his father Christopher, he says that in 1477 his father saw in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]] two dead bodies which had washed ashore in their boat. The bodies and boat were of exotic appearance, and have been suggested to have been [[Inuit]] who had drifted off course.&lt;ref&gt;Seaver (1995), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the Norse took other indigenous peoples to Europe as slaves over the following centuries, because they are known to have taken Scottish and Irish slaves.&lt;ref name=ADE163&gt;{{cite book |title= The American Discovery of Europe|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |year= 2007 |publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-252-03152-6 |page= 163|url= https://books.google.com/?id=cd8yZn7MfSQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=American+Discovery+of+Europe#v=onepage&amp;q=Nidaros&amp;f=false|accessdate= December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;{{cite book |title= Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples|last= Forbes |first= Jack D. |year= 1993|publisher= University of Illinois Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-252-06321-3 |pages= 18–21| url= https://books.google.com/?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Trondheim+cathedral+Inuit#v=onepage&amp;q=Trondheim%20cathedral%20Inuit&amp;f=false |accessdate= December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Columbian contact between [[Alaska]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] via the [[subarctic]] [[Aleutian Islands]] would have been conceivable, but the two settlement waves on this archipelago started on the American side and its western continuation, the [[Commander Islands]], remained uninhabited until after [[Vitus Bering|Russian explorers]] encountered the [[Aleut people]] in 1741. There is no genetic or linguistic evidence for earlier contact along this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Peopling of the Aleutians |date=January 13, 2012 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.335.6065.158 |volume=335 |number=6065 |pages=158–161 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6065/158|bibcode=2012Sci...335..158B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 17th-century speculation ===
{{Main article|Ten Lost Tribes}}
In 1650, a British preacher in Norfolk, Thomas Thorowgood, published ''Jewes in America or Probabilities that the Americans are of that Race'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm Oliver's Bookshelf, The Premier Web-Site for Early Mormon History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184039/http://olivercowdery.com/texts/1660Thor.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected that they might be Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1652 [[Hamon L'Estrange|Sir Hamon L'Estrange]], an English author writing on history and theology, published ''Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that the Americans are of that Race'' in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], a [[Puritan]] missionary who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|title=The Lost Tribes of Israel: The History of a Myth|publisher=Phoenix|year=2003|pages=66, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mormon teachings ===
[[File:Izapa Stela 5.svg|right|thumb|upright|[[Izapa Stela 5]]]]
{{Main article|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon}}
The [[Book of Mormon]], a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] published by  founder and leader [[Joseph Smith Jr]] in 1830 at the age of twenty-four, states that some ancient inhabitants of the New World are descendants of Semitic peoples who sailed from the Old World. Mormon groups such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] attempt to study and expand on these ideas. Scientific consensus rejects these claims.

The [[National Geographic Society]], in a 1998 letter to the [[Institute for Religious Research]], stated "Archaeologists and other scholars have long probed the hemisphere's past and the society does not know of anything found so far that has substantiated the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mit.irr.org/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon "National Geographic Society Statement on the Book of Mormon"].  August 12, 1998.  Letter from Julie Crain addressed to Luke Wilson of the Institute for Religious Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LDS scholars hold the view that archaeological study of Book of Mormon claims are not meant to vindicate the literary narrative.  For example, [[Terryl Givens]], professor of English at the University of Richmond, points out that there is a lack of historical accuracy in the Book of Mormon in relation to modern archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref name="Givens2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Givens|first=Terryl|title=The Latter-day Saint Experience i n America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEEkTWyIpZkC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32750-6|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Professor M. Wells Jakeman popularized a belief that the [[Izapa Stela 5]] represents the Book of Mormon prophets Lehi and Nephi's [[tree of life vision]], and was a validation of the historicity of the claims of pre-Columbian settlement in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;*{{aut|Brewer, Stewart W.}}, (1999); [http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=jbms&amp;id=180 "The History of an Idea: The Scene on Stela 5 from Izapa, Mexico, as a Representation of Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life"], (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretations of the carving and its connection to pre-Columbian contact have been disputed.&lt;ref name="Paulson2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paulson|first=Matthew A.|title=Breaking the Mormon Code|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pbi_OfkPhzwC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=8 November 2014|date=2000-09-01|publisher=WingSpan Press|isbn=978-1-59594-067-4|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, scholarship on the Book of Mormon has concentrated on cultural parallels rather than "smoking gun" sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lund|first=John|title=MesoAmerica And The Book of Mormon|date=2007-11-22|publisher=Granite Publishing &amp; Distribution|isbn=978-1891114403|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Joseph|title=Exploring the Lands of the Book of Mormon|date=1989-06-15|publisher=S.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10039">A '''progress trap''' is the condition human societies experience when, in pursuing progress through human ingenuity, they inadvertently introduce problems they do not have the resources or political will to solve, for fear of short-term losses in status, stability or quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Meek Lange|first=Margaret|title=Progress|date=2011|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/progress/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2011|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents further progress and sometimes leads to [[societal collapse]].

The syndrome appears to have been first described by Walter Von Krämer, in his series of 1989 articles&lt;ref&gt;Von Krämer, W. ''Fortschrittsfalle Medizin (Medical progress traps)'', [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13493998.html Der Spiegel], 13 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; under the title ''Fortschrittsfalle Medizin''. The specific neologism "progress trap" was introduced independently in 1990 by Daniel B. O'Leary with his study of the behavioral aspects of this condition.

The term subsequently gained attention following the [[historian]] and [[novelist]] [[Ronald Wright]]'s 2004 book and [[Massey Lecture]] series ''[[A Short History of Progress]]'', in which he sketches world history so far as a succession of progress traps. With the documentary film version of Wright's book ''[[Surviving Progress]]'', backed by Martin Scorsese, the concept achieved wider recognition. 

==Overview==

While the idea is not new, Wright identifies the central problem as being one of scale and political will. According to him, the error is often to extrapolate from what appears to work well on a small scale to a larger scale, which depletes natural resources and causes environmental degradation. Large-scale implementation also tends to be subject to [[diminishing returns]]. As [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[erosion]], [[greenhouse gas]] emissions or other consequences become apparent, society is destabilized.

In a progress trap, those in positions of authority are unwilling to make changes necessary for future survival. To do so they would need to sacrifice their current status and political power at the top of a hierarchy. They may also be unable to raise public support and the necessary economic resources, even if they try. Deforestation and erosion in ancient Greece may be an example of the latter.

A new source of natural resources can provide a reprieve. The European discovery and exploitation of the "New World" is one example of this, but seems unlikely to be repeated today. Present global civilization has covered the planet to such an extent there are no new resources in sight. Wright concludes that if not averted by some other means, collapse will be on a global scale, if or when it comes. Current economic crises, population problems and global climate change are symptoms that highlight the interdependence of current national economies and ecologies.

The problem has deep historical roots, probably dating back to the origins of life on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. In the early [[stone age]], improved hunting techniques in vulnerable areas caused the extinction of many prey species, leaving the enlarged populace without an adequate food supply. The only apparent alternative, [[agriculture]], also proved to be a progress trap. Salination, deforestation, erosion and urban sprawl led to disease, malnutrition and so forth, hence shorter lives.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

Almost any sphere of [[technology]] can prove to be a progress trap, as in the example of [[medicine]] and its possibly inadequate response to the drawbacks of the high-density agricultural practices (e.g. [[factory farming]]) it has enabled. Wright uses [[weapon]] [[technology]] gradually reaching the threat of total nuclear destruction to illustrate this point. Ultimately, Wright strives to counter at least the Victorian notion of "modernity" as unconditionally a good thing.

==Behavioral causes==

In ''Escaping the progress trap'', O'Leary finds that, besides vested interests and socioeconomic compliance, individual behavior is a significant contributing factor to progress traps, which are not limited to technology. This can be verified in terms of new information from the neurosciences, notably [[lateralization of brain function]], where the short-term goals of a man-made world are increasingly favoured over long-term global interests. His study of this shows how institutions and societies can become committed to an exclusive form of technocratic rationalism. In this scenario, humans diverge from a default interdependence with nature with the result that short-term technical preoccupations slowly inhibit creativity and long-term problem solving, thus compromising long-term interests. 

Where advances are created by technical specialization ''and'' are harmful; such as [[desertification]] resulting from mismanaged [[irrigation]]; this trend compounds itself and can be irreversible, with collapse resulting. Classic cases would be [[Sumer]] and the Indus Valley civilization where output-raising irrigation canals and logging slowly combined to make the fields far too salty to continue supporting the harvests on which the populations relied. 

Other examples, such as [[Seymour Cray]]'s overspecialized [[Control Data Corporation]] or the Medieval Church's rejection of [[Roger Bacon]]'s science follow the pattern: The mode of development itself excluded solutions to problems arising from that development. In a contemporary context, unabated [[oil consumption]] in a time of [[climate change]] is an illustration of the problem; [[sustainable development]] is viewed as a solution.

According to O'Leary, avoiding the progress trap pattern can be achieved by ensuring, through education and cultural vitality, that individuals and societies do not become preeminently [[technocratic]]. Citing research into [[creativity]] and resiliency theory, he argues that the intuitive side of the mind/brain must thrive, so that lateral thinking will be an option for seeing and preventing progress traps. Spelling this out in scientific terms may be necessary for policymakers to take notice.

Iain McGilchrist's 2009 book ''[[The Master and His Emissary]]'', provides neurological insight into behaviors where excessive attention to short-term interests might compromise long-term interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13364">'''Psychobiography''' aims to understand historically significant individuals, such as [[artist]]s or [[political leader]]s, through the application of [[psychological theory]] and research.

Through its merging of [[personality psychology]] and historical evidence,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality'' (2009) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; psychobiography may be considered a historical form of therapeutic [[case study]]: it represents a growing field in the realm of [[biography]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Rollyson, ''Biography'' (2007)   p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; '''Psychopathography''' is sometimes used as a term to indicate that the person being analyzed was not mentally healthy, "path" coming from ''pathos'' (πάθος)—Ancient Greek for suffering or illness. 

==Background==

Psychobiography is a field within the realms of [[psychology]] and [[biography]] that analyzes the lives of historically significant individuals through psychological theory and research. Its goal is to develop a better understanding of notable individuals by [[applied psychology|applying psychological]] theories to their biographies to further explain the motives behind some of the subjects actions and decisions. Popular subjects of psychobiographies include figures such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Saddam Hussein]]. A typical biography is often very descriptive, and tries to record every notable event that happened in a person's lifetime, whereas a psychobiography primarily focuses on some particular events, and tries to better understand why they happened. This field's potential has not only aided in developing a better understanding to many notable biographies throughout history, but has also inspired direction and insight into the field of psychology.

One of the first great examples of this field's utility was Dr. [[Henry Murray]]'s report on the analysis of Adolf Hitler's personality during the end of [[World War II]]. Forced to psychoanalyze from a distance, Dr. Murray used multiple sources, including Hitler's genealogy, Hitler's own writings, and biographies of Hitler, so that the Allied forces could understand his personality to better predict his behavior. By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, Dr. Murray presumed Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat. This work by Dr. Murray not only helped establish personality psychology as a behavioral science, but it also showed how the field of psychobiography could be applied as a means of psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Henry. "The Analysis of The Personality of Adolph Hitler." The Analysis of The personality of Adolph Hitler (1943). N.p., n.d. Web&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s analysis of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (titled ''[[Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood]]'') is generally considered the first "modern" psychobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons who have been the subject of psychobiographical research include Freud, [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Robert G.L. ''[[The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler]].'' New York: First DaCapo Press Edition, (1993) (orig. pub. 1977). {{ISBN|0-306-80514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Martin Luther]],&lt;ref&gt;G, R, Elton, ''The Practice of History'' (1969) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger.  ''Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography'' Granta Books, London, (2002); Vienna, (2000); New York (2002) {{ISBN|0-393-05008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Barzun/H. F. Graff, ''The Modern Researcher'' (1977) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Major psychobiographical authors include [[Erik Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carducci, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; [[James William Anderson]], [[Henry Murray]], [[George Atwood]], and [[William Runyan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Many psychobiographies are [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]] or [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] in orientation, but other commonly used theories include narrative models of identity such as the life story model, [[script theory]], [[Object relations theory|object relations]], and [[existentialism]]/[[Existential phenomenology|phenomenology]]; and psychobiographers are increasingly looking for explanatory complexity through an eclectic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Alan C. Elms, ''Uncovering Lives'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there were other psychobiographies written before [[Freud]]'s ''Leonardo da Vinci and A Memory of His Childhood'' in 1910, it is considered the most significant contribution of its time, despite its flaws. Psychobiographies about [[William Shakespeare]] (Jones, 1910), [[Giovanni Segantini]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Richard Wagner]] (Graf, 1911), [[Amenhotep IV]] (Abraham, 1912), [[Martin Luther]] (Smith, 1913), and [[Socrates]] (Karpas, 1915) were also published between 1910 and 1915, but are not as well known.&lt;ref name="Runyan"&gt;Runyan, W., M. (1988). Progress in psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 295-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1920 and 1926, psychobiographies of [[Margaret Fuller]] (Anthony, 1920), [[Samuel Adams]] (Harlow, 1923), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (Krutch, 1926), and [[Abraham Lincoln]] (Clark, 1923) were published by authors from a psychoanalytic perspective without a background in psychoanalysis. During the 1930s [[Tolstoy]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Molière]], [[George Sand|Sand]], [[Goethe]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Nietzsche]], Poe, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Caesar]], Lincoln, [[Napoleon]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], and [[Alexander the Great]] were the subjects of psychobiographies, and soon afterward in 1943 a psychobiography of [[Adolf Hitler]], predicting his suicide, was written during World War II, but was not published until 1972. Recent, significant contributions between 1960 and 1990 include psychobiographies of [[Henry James]] (Edel, 1953–72), [[Isaac Newton]] (Manuel, 1968), [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (Erikson, 1969), [[Max Weber]] (Mitzman, 1969), [[Emily Dickinson]] (Cody, 1971), [[Joseph Stalin]] (Tucker, 1973), [[James Mill|James]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] ([[Bruce Mazlish|Mazlish]], 1975), [[T. E. Lawrence]] (Mack, 1976), Adolf Hitler (Waite, 1977), [[Beethoven]] (Solomon, 1977), [[Samuel Johnson]] (Bate, 1977), [[Alice James]] (Strouse, 1980), [[Wilhelm Reich]] (Sharaf, 1983), and [[William James]] (Feinstein, 1984).&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, W., T. (2005). Handbook of psychobiography. New York, NY: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychobiographies at this time were also written about groups of people, focusing on an aspect they had in common such as American presidents, philosophers, utopians, revolutionary leaders, and personality theorists. These psychobiographies are the most well known, but since 1910 there have been over 4000 psychobiographies published.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;

As psychobiography gained recognition, authors from a variety of professions contributed their own work from alternate perspectives and varying methods of analysis of the psychobiographical subjects, significantly expanding psychobiography beyond the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical perspective]]. Apart from psychoanalysts and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]] who wrote the first psychobiographies, there have been historians, [[political science|political scientists]], [[personality psychology|personality psychologists]], literary critics, [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] that have contributed to the growth of the field.&lt;ref name="Runyan" /&gt;
Psychobiography has also conflicted with contemporary views of science since its origin because it contains no controlled variables or experimentation. In its early years it was dismissed as unscientific and not a legitimate addition to the field of [[psychology]] due to the push towards experimentation focused on physiological and biological factors, and away from philosophical psychology, to establish it as a natural science. The value of psychobiography to psychology is comparable to [[evolutionary psychology]], [[archeology]], and [[historical geology]], offering detailed analyses of subjects with an emphasis on contextual information, but due to the qualitative nature of this information it remains a challenge to validate psychobiographical works as empirically based applications of psychology.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}

The discipline of psychobiography has developed various methodological guidelines for psychobiographical study.  Some of the most prominent are these:

# The use of prototypical scenes in the life of the subject to serve as a model of their personality pattern
# The use of a series of indicators of salience, markers such as primacy, frequency, and uniqueness of an event in a life, to identify significant patterns
# The identification of pregnant [[metaphor]]s or images that organize autobiographical narratives
# Logical coherence or consistency as a criterion for adequate psychological interpretations

Scholars untrained in the discipline who do not follow these guidelines continue to produce psychobiographical studies.

==Contributors==

===Sigmund Freud===

Freud's psychoanalytic approach (Freudian perspective) is not commonly used in its entirety in psychobiography, but it has had a lasting influence on the analysis of behavior in other areas of psychology. To sift through a lifetime of information and locate significant areas in the subject's development requires a system of identification, and psychoanalysis provided the base for this. Primacy, the initial exposure or experience, was recognized by Freud as an important factor in personality development and has remained an important aspect of personality psychology, [[psychotherapy]], and psychobiography. Frequency, repeated exposure or actions, is also important, but its significance can vary. If the frequency of an action is low then it is seen as unimportant, and if the frequency is too high it becomes passive and overlooked, also becoming less important in psychobiography. Freud's knowledge of the importance of frequency is shown in the analysis of dreams, slips, errors, and humor by recognizing that repetition leads people to disregard these behaviors or stimuli. The importance of error in psychobiography, including [[Freudian slip|slips]] and distortions, is also rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis and is used to identify hidden motives.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, I., E. (1988). Personality, psychological assessment, and psychobiography. Journal of Personality, 56, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elms===

Elms has contributed to psychobiography through many published works including psychobiographies on [[Gordon Allport|Allport]] (1972), Freud (1980), [[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] (1981), and [[Henry Murray|Murray]] (1987). He has also written about the subject of psychobiography in ''Psychobiography and Case Study Methods'' and ''Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology'' defining psychobiography and its methods, and explaining the value of psychobiography in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (2007). Psychobiography and case study methods. In R. W. Robins, R. C. Fraley, &amp; R. F. Krueger (Eds.), The Handbook of Research Methods in Personality Psychology. New York: Guilford Press, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elms, A. C. (1994). Uncovering Lives: The Uneasy Alliance of Biography and Psychology. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press. Paperback reprint, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Psychobiography has faced criticism from the very start,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 312-3&lt;/ref&gt; crystallised above all in the production of what Erikson caricatured as "originology"—the explaining away of significant public events and actions as the product of some minute childhood detail.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad psychobiography—using mechanical psychologising, a selective mining of the facts,&lt;ref&gt;Barzun, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; overdeterminism, and a tendency to pathologise&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;—is considered easy to write.  [[Anna Freud]] condemned the study of [[Woodrow Wilson]] Freud himself co-authored with [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]] on just such grounds,&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 559 and 776&lt;/ref&gt; and the haphazard historical evolution of the disciple has not helped reduce its prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;Elms, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7798">'''Sebastian Sobecki''' (born 1973) is a medievalist specialising in English literature, history, and manuscript studies. 

== Biography ==
Sobecki is Professor of Medieval English Literature and Culture at the [[University of Groningen]], the oldest chair (founded in 1886) for English literature in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fV3w7EOWUQkC&amp;q=1886#v=snippet&amp;q=1886&amp;f=false|title=One Hundred Years of English Studies in Dutch Universities: Seventeen Papers Read at the Centenary Conference, Groningen, 15-16 January 1986|last=Bunt|first=Gerrit|date=1986|website=|publisher=Rodopi|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-09-22|isbn=978-9062037896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also holds by courtesy the Professorship of Old Germanic, established in 1881. Having received his education at the [[University of Cambridge]], Sobecki became an Assistant Professor at [[McGill University]] before being appointed at Groningen. He works on medieval English and early Tudor literature, particularly on Chaucer, Gower, manuscripts, politics, law, travel, and Anglo-European relations. Sobecki was awarded the John Hurt Fisher Prize by the John Gower Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/|title=Department of English, University of Groningen|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wcu.edu/johngower/FisherPrize/index.html|title=John Hurt Fisher Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobecki has written widely on medieval and early modern topics, across 10 published and forthcoming books, and more than 50 academic articles and chapters, many of which have appeared in leading journals, including [[Speculum (journal)|''Speculum'']], ''English Literary History'', ''Studies in the Age of Chaucer'', ''Renaissance Studies'', ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', ''[[The Chaucer Review]]'', ''The Library'', ''New Medieval Literatures'', and ''[[The Review of English Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/research/publications.html|title=Department of English, University of Groningen, Sobecki, Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Michelle Karnes (University of Notre Dame), Sobecki has been appointed editor of the journal ''Studies in the Age of Chaucer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/let/organization/actueel/nieuwsberichten-2018/2018-05-18-sobecki-editor-sac?lang=en|title=Prof Sobecki appointed new co-editor Studies in the Age of Chaucer (SAC) Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is completing his third authored book, ''The Material Politics of England’s Fifteenth-Century Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press) and two volumes in the Oxford edition of [[Richard Hakluyt]]'s ''Principal Navigations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hakluyt.org/|title=Hakluyt Editorial Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobecki is also editing ''The Cambridge History of Medieval Travel Writing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.i.sobecki/projects|title=Department of English, University of Groningen, Sobecki, Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has made a number of important archival discoveries, such as identifying [[John Gower]]'s autograph hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2015/10/john-gowers-handwriting-identified/|title=John Gower's Handwriting identified|last=|first=|date=2015-10-22|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding a letter written for [[Margery Kempe]]'s son,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/archive-find-shows-medieval-mystic-margery-kempes-autobiography-doesnt-lie|title=Archive find shows medieval mystic Margery Kempe's autobiography 'doesn't lie'|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2015-05-08|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; locating rebels linked to ''[[Piers Plowman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/poaching-piers-plowman/|title=Poaching with Piers Plowman|last=|first=|date=2018-02-09|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing the author ([[John Peyton (died 1635)|John Peyton]]) of the earliest English description of Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newhistorian.com/espionage-in-early-modern-central-europe-revealed/4013/|title=Espionage in Early Modern Central Europe Revealed|last=Thake|first=Adam Steedman|date=2015-06-09|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/european/2015/05/how-the-spy-john-peyton-put-poland-on-the-map.html|title=How the spy John Peyton put Poland on the map (to keep King James on the throne)|last=|first=|date=2015-05-29|website=British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrating connections between tax records and the [[General Prologue]] to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2018/06/six-degrees-of-chaucer-how-southwark-shaped-the-canterbury-tales/|title=Six Degrees of Chaucer: How Southwark Shaped The Canterbury Tales|last=Cybulskie|first=Danièle|date=2018-06-04|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobecki is also the voice behind the popular video recording of [[John Skelton]]'s '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCckcTHWqKw Speke Parott'].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-29536411|title=#BBCtrending: The 500-year-old poem that captivated Reddit|last=|first=|date=2014-10-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-what-the-english-language-sounded-like-500-years-ago--b1leV6aXmLg|title=Here's what the English language sounded like 500 years ago|last=Stewart|first=Ellen|date=2015|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony''' ({{lang-de|Staatliche Schlösser, Burgen und Gärten Sachsen}}) is a state-owned company with its head office in [[Dresden]]. It belongs to the Saxon State Ministry of Finance and has the aim of preserving Saxon cultural heritage whilst respecting [[culture|cultural]] and [[architectural conservation|conservation]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schloesserland-sachsen.de/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Satzung_SSBG.pdf/ Satzung (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The state-owned company manages several palaces, castles and parks in the [[Saxony]]. These include the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Dresden]], the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]] and [[Kriebstein Castle]].

== History ==
Following the restoration of the [[Free State of Saxony]] on 3 October 1990, assets that had already been owned in the past by the state, or which had been managed during the East German era as legal entities under the Asset Allocation Act, were transferred into the ownership of the new German state.

Starting on the first of January 1992, the state took over the following properties: [[Dresden Castle]] including the [[Johanneum (Dresden)|Johanneum]] and the [[Stallhof (Dresden)|Stallhof]], the Dresden [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] and the Zwinger Gardens, the [[Japanese Palace]] with its palace garden, [[Pillnitz Castle|Pillnitz Castle and park]], [[Schloss Moritzburg|Moritzburg Palace]] and the surrounding landscape gardens, the [[Albrechtsburg|Albrechtsburg in Meißen]], [[Königstein Fortress]], [[Schloss Weesenstein]], [[Gnandstein Castle]], [[Frauenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)|Frauenstein castle ruins]], [[Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens]], [[Hubertusburg|Hubertusburg Palace]], [[Nischwitz Palace]], [[Burg Stolpen|Stolpen Castle]], [[Augustusburg Hunting Lodge|Augustusburg Palace]], [[Lichtenwalde Palace]], the [[Muskau Park|palace and park at Bad Muskau]], [[Colditz Castle]], [[Altzella Abbey]], [[Nossen Palace]], [[Pegau#Wiederau Palace|Wiederau Palace]], [[Mildenstein Castle]] and the [[Ortenburg (Bautzen)|Ortenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 1/907&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, other historic buildings were allocated to the Free State of Saxony.

With a cabinet decision on third November 1992, 17 independent state companies were formed for some of the most important sites and placed under commercial management. These companies together formed the State Palaces Department (''Staatliche Schlösserverwaltung''). During the implementation phase, between 1 April 1993 and 1 January 1994, 15 state-owned enterprises were founded for the following properties:&lt;ref name="2/10146"&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 2/10146&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 April 1993: the Albrechtsburg at Meißen, Augustusburg Palace, Scharfenstein Castle, Königstein Fortress, Moritzburg Palace
* 1 June 1993: Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens, Gnandstein Castle, Kriebstein Castle, Mildenstein Castle, Rammenau Palace, Stolpen Castle, Weesenstein Palace
* 1 August 1993: Dresden State Palaces and Gardens (''Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Dresden'') (Pillnitz Palace and park, the Großer Garten, the Brühlsche Terrasse/Zwinger/Stallhof), Nossen Palace/Altzella Abbey Park
* 1 January 1994: Rochlitz Palace

In addition, the Palaces Department managed the following properties directly: the [[Albertinum (Dresden)|Albertinum]], the [[Catholic Church of the Royal Court of Saxony|Catholic Court Church]], the [[Jägerhof (Dresden)|Jägerhof]], the [[Freiberg Cathedral#Chancel and Royal Burial Chapel of the Albertines|Royal Burial Chapel at Freiberg]], [[Colditz Castle]], [[Lichtenwalde Palace]] and the [[Art Gallery in the Lipsius building|Exhibition Hall of the Academy of Art]].&lt;ref name="2/10146" /&gt;

The following properties remained under the administration of local authority land offices: the [[Japanese Palace]], [[Siebeneichen Palace]], [[Reinhardtsgrimma Palace]], the [[Ortenburg (Bautzen)|Ortenburg]], [[Hubertusburg|Hubertusburg Palace]], [[Freudenstein Castle]], [[Wurzen Palace]], [[Grimma Palace]] [[Königswartha#Palace and park|Königswartha Palace]], [[Suchominsky Villa]],  [[Sonnenstein Castle]], [[Dippoldiswalde Palace]], the [[Lauterstein Castle (Marienberg)|Niederlauterstein castle ruins]], the [[Frauenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)|Frauenstein castle ruins]], [[Wachwitz Palace]], the [[Wachwitz Palace|Royal Villa]],  [[Lützschena Palace]], [[Thallwitz Palace]], the [[Grillenburg Hunting Lodge]], [[Brauna Palace]], the [[Keppschloss]], [[Schieritz Palace|Zehren-Schieritz Palace]], [[Königsbrück Palace]], [[Gaussig House]], [[Hohenprießnitz Palace]] and [[Ruhenthal Palace]].&lt;ref name="2/10146" /&gt; Many of these sites were later transferred to the towns and cities in which they were situated or sold off to third parties.

On 1 March 1996 the Saxon Palaces Department was incorporated into the State Finance Office. On 1 July 2000 the companies running Königstein Fortress on the one hand and the castles of Augustusburg, Lichtenwalde, and Scharfenstein on the other hand were turned in a charitable company. Their owner remains the Free State of Saxony. The management of those involved is carried out by the Palaces Department.

In the period from 1993 to 2003 the Palaces Department's share of the cost rose from 37% to 61.4%. As of 1 January 2003, the Palaces Department was separate from the State Office and a common public enterprise, the "State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony", was founded. The palace companies are its individual business units.&lt;ref&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 3/8236&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Schlösserland Sachsen'' ==
In 2005, the advertising association ''Schlösserland Sachsen'' (Castles of Saxony) was created, a federation of major governmental and non-governmental heritage building and gardens groups, which has the task of preserviing, maintaining and displaying Saxony's [[cultural monument]]s. Under this umbrella brand, in cooperation with the Saxony Tourism Marketing Corporation (TMGS), more than 50 castles, palaces, gardens, fortresses and castle hotels are marketed both nationwide and internationally.

The following palaces, castles and abbeys are partners in the ''Werbegemeinschaft Schlösserland Sachsen'':

[[File:Amrum M Suessen-3567-2.jpg|thumb|Talking Gravestones at St. Clemens Church, in [[Nebel, Germany|Nebel]] on Amrum Island, Germany]]

The '''Talking Gravestones of Amrum''' ({{lang-de|Sprechende Grabsteine}}), also known as the '''Story-telling Gravestones''' (''Erzählende Grabsteine''), are historic artifacts on the German island of [[Amrum]], one of the [[North Frisian Islands]] off the west coast of the [[Jutland]] Peninsula. They stand in a legally protected section of the St. Clemens Church cemetery in the village of [[Nebel, Germany|Nebel]]. The gravestones, totaling 152, are inscribed with sometimes detailed accounts of the occupations, life histories, social rank and families of the deceased. The best-known gravestone is for [[Hark Olufs]], an early 18th-century seafarer and folk hero.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Rheinheimer: [http://www.amrum-kirche.de/friedhoefe_friedhof_martin_rheinheimer.pdf ''Im Hafen der Ewigkeit? Der Amrumer Friedhof als Touristenattraktion''], ''Nordfriesisches Jahrbuch'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fof-ohlsdorf.de/aktuelles/2011/113s26_amru |work=Ohlsdorf – Zeitschrift für Trauerkultur |title=Wenn die Verstorbenen heute noch 'erzählen' |issue=113 |year=2011 |language=German |author=Carmen Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Landesamt&gt;Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Schleswig-Holstein: [http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/LD/Downloads/Publikationen/LfD_Kurzberichte2012_2.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1 ''Neu geordnet: Historische Grabsteine auf dem alten Friedhof in Nebel auf Amrum Kreis Nordfriesland, Nebel auf Amrum, Stoltenberag, Kirchhof''], February 2012. Accessed 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talking Gravestones of Föhr|Similar objects]] can be found at the neighbouring island [[Föhr]].

The gravestones, most made of sandstone by local stonemasons, date from 1678 to 1858. Their inscriptions reflect the historic culture of the times and the whaling industry that then occupied many Frisian Islanders.&lt;ref name="Quedens p108"&gt;{{harvnb|Quedens|Hingst|Stück|Wilts|1991|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest are 2 meters (6.7 feet) tall and weigh about {{convert|800|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Spiegel"&gt;Matthias Schulz: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-58138761.html ''Kostbares Gedächtnis'']. In: ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', edition 29, 2008. Accessed 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stonemasons==
Except for a few large monuments that were created by professional stonemasons from elsewhere, the gravestones were carved by local craftsmen and ship's carpenters.&lt;ref&gt;Renate Preuss: [http://www.landundmeer.de/Artikel/4799/Sprechende-Steine.html ''Sprechende Steine'']. In: ''Land und Meer''. Accessed 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They included Tai Hirichs (1718–1759) from the coastal islet [[Nordstrandischmoor]], Jens Payen (1711–1787) and Arfst Hanken (1735–1826) from the neighboring island [[Föhr]], as well as the Amrum resident Jan Peters (1768–1855), who crafted 36 of the still intact gravestones. Hinrichs created the most widely known markers, those of Oluf Jensen and his son Hark Olufs.&lt;ref&gt;Christa Langenhan, Michael Langenhan: [http://www.fof-ohlsdorf.de/kulturgeschichte/2013/120s25_amrum ''Historische Grabsteine auf dem Friedhof in Nebel auf Amrum'']. In: ''OHLSDORF – Zeitschrift für Trauerkultur''. Edition No. 120, I, 2013. Accessed 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these craftsmen were not trained stonemasons, the quality of their work is considered above average.&lt;ref name="monika"&gt;Malaika Krohn: [http://www.fof-ohlsdorf.de/kulturgeschichte/2012/117s25/amrun ''Restaurierung auf dem Friedhof in Nebel auf Amrum'']. In: ''OHLSDORF – Zeitschrift für Trauerkultur''. Edition 117, II, 2012. Accessed 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and symbolism==
Most of the inscriptions are engraved but some are raised above the surface. Various styles of writing are employed. The oldest examples are written primarily in the [[High German]] (''Hochdeutsch'') employed in religious services, even though Amrum belonged for centuries to [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="renate"&gt;Renate Preuss: [http://www.landundmeer.de/Artikel/4799/Sprechende-Steine.html ''Sprechende Steine'']. In ''Land und Meer''. Accessed 21 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscriptions include detailed information about the origins of the deceased, dates of birth and death, marriage and number of children. Many include detailed information about the subjects' lives, and some are so long that the reverse side of the gravestone had to be used for the complete story.&lt;ref name="Quedens p108" /&gt;

The gravestone of Hark Olufs, to cite a key example, says on its front side:{{refn|group=notes|''Hier liegt der grosse Krieger-Held. Ruhe sanft auf Amrom Christen Feld. Als seeliger Harck Olufs, so daselbst gebohren auf Amrum Anno 1708 den 19. Julii. Bald darauf in sein jungen Jahren von den türckischen Seeräubern zu Algier ist er A[nn]o 1724 d[en] 24. Martii gefangen genommen worden. In solcher Gefangenschaft aber hat er dem türkischen Bey zu Constantin als Casnadaje 11 und ein virtel Jahr gedinet, bis ihm endlich dieser Bey A[nn]o 1735 d[en] 31. October aus Gewogenheit zu ihm seine Freyheit geschencket, da er denn das folgende Jahr darauf als A[nn]o 1736 d[en] 25. April glücklich wiederum alhier auff seinem Vaterland angelanget ist, und sich also A[nn]o 1737 in dem Stande der heiligen Ehe begeben mit Antje Harken, so nun sich nebst 5 Kindern in den betrübten Wittwestande befindet. In solcher Ehe haben sie aber einen Sohn und 4 Töchtern gezeugt. So mit ihr alle den Tod ihres Vaters fühlen müssen, da er gestorben ist A[nn]o 1754 d[en] 13. October, und sein Leben gebracht auf 46 Jahr und 13 Wochen.''}}

[[File:Amrum M Suessen-3479.jpg|thumb|165px|left|Gravestone of Hark Olufs – front side]]
''Here lies the great war hero, may he rest in peace in Amrum's Christian ground.''

''Blessedly, Harck Olufs was born on Amrom on July 19 in the year 1708. While still in his youth he was captured by Turkish pirates from Algiers on 24 March 1724. He was enslaved and served the Turkish [[bey]] in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] as Casnadaye, for eleven and one-fourth years, until the bey, out of consideration for his work, granted him freedom. On 25 April in the year 1736 he reached his fatherland again. The following year was united in holy matrimony with Antje Harken, and they had five children, one son and four daughters. All survived the death of their father on 13 October in the year 1754, after 46 years and 13 weeks of life.''

[[File:Gravestones in Amrum017.jpg|thumb|220px|Gravestone of miller Erk Knudten]]

The inscription continues on the reverse side:{{refn|group=notes|''Gott gebe dem Leibe eine fröliche Auferstehung am jüngsten Tage. An den Meinigen ruff ich aus dem Grabe noch diese Zeilen zum Andencken zurück: Ach leider: In meinen jungen Jahren Müst ich zum Raub der Algierer fahren Und halten fast zwölff Jahr die Slaverey. Doch machte Gott durch seine Hand mich frey. Darüm sage ich noch einmal: Ich weis, mein Gott, ich muß nun sterben. Ich will, eins aber bitt ich aus. Las doch die Meinigen nicht verderben. Bewahre du das Witwenhaus. Ach Gott, weil ich nicht sorgen kan, so nim dich Frau und Kinder an.''}}

:''"May God grant him a joyful resurrection on the earliest day." From the grave I speak the following lines of remembrance:  Unfortunately, in my young years I had to yield myself to the Algerians and undergo almost 12 years of slavery. But God with his mighty hand set me free. Therefore I say once again, I know my God that I must die. But do not consider my faults. Protect thou the widow's home and, oh God, because I cannot care for them, take the wife and children under your care.''

The largest gravestones formerly stood on the graves of Amrumers who took part in the lucrative whaling expeditions to Greenland. Other artistically carved stones marked the graves of members of the upper class and other prosperous families. Each engraved letter cost about 3 [[gold mark]]s, while an average man earned only about 10 gold marks a year. However,  in a good season a whaling ship's captain could bring home around 900 marks.&lt;ref name="Härig"&gt;Beatrice Härig: [http://www.monumente-online.de/de/ausgaben/2015/3/seelen-unter-segel.php#.WAuQgPTD-Fk ''Die sprechenden Steine von Amrum. Seelen unter Segel'']. In ''Monumente-Online'', June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The graves of poor people usually were marked by only a red sandstone slab with dates of birth and death or with a simple wooden cross.&lt;ref name=Landesamt /&gt;

Many gravestones are decorated with depictions of ships. Typical vessels represented include fishing smacks, [[galiot]]s, {{ill|tjalk|lt=tjalks|de}}, [[Koff (ship type)|koff]]s, [[brig]]s, [[barque]]s, [[whaler]]s and armed cargo ships (''Handelsfregatten''). However, these ship carvings did not necessarily mean the deceased was a sailor; rather, they symbolized the voyage of life or, when anchored in a harbor, the end of life's journey. Other designs include a Dutch windmill on the gravestone of the seafarer and later miller Erk Knudten (1733–1801), and a man in a Sunday suit on the marker of the church sacristan Hark Knudten.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quedens|Hingst|Stück|Wilts|1991|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers on gravestones are thought to represent a full life, although broken stalks denote relatives of the deceased that had died earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DuMont Reise-Taschenbuch: Reiseführer Sylt, Föhr, Amrum |author=Claudia Banck |language=German |page=68 |year=2014 |publisher=DuMont Reiseverlag |isbn=9783770189649 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EE-dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first of Amrum's gravestones were finished in the last decades of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="St. Clemens"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amrum-kirche.de/friedhoefe_broschuere-historische-grabsteine.pdf |title=Historische Grabsteine St. Clemens Amrum |page=2 |editor=St. Clemens congregation |language=German |accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the standard of living on Amrum began to increase rapidly due to the proceeds of whaling. But economic conditions began to decline in the early 19th century, so there are fewer "talking gravestones" from then on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quedens|Hingst|Stück|Wilts|1991|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in  1864 Amrum was briefly ruled cooperatively by Prussia and Austria, but  after the former's victory over Austria in 1866 it became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Then, in 1871, Prussia was subsumed into the newly united [[German Empire]], in which Amrum was part of the Province of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. The new [[Wilhelmine]] rulers disliked the "disorderly" old cemetery in Nebel and substituted die-straight walks, placing some 'talking' gravestones in the cemetery walls. In that location some weathered quickly and became illegible.&lt;ref name="Härig"/&gt;

[[File:Gravestones in Amrum373.jpg|thumb|450px|left|The Way of the Stones]]

In 2009, a group of local residents began a drive to restore the gravestones, though some could no longer be rescued. The project ultimately cost 330,000 [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Viere, [https://www.nordkirche.de/nachrichten/nachrichten/detail/kirche-auf-amrum-rettet-sprechende-grabsteine.html ''Kirche auf Amrum rettet „sprechende“ Grabsteine'']. Evangelischer Pressedienst, 12 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the new arrangement, the St. Clemens congregation placed the 152 gravestones in thematically related sections along a "Way of the Stones" (''Allee der Steine'').&lt;ref name="St. Clemens"/&gt;

The '''theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas''' suggests that the earliest [[Old World]] [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|contact]] with the [[Americas]] was not with [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] or [[Norse colonization of North America|Norse settlers]], but with the [[Phoenicians]] (or, alternatively, other [[Semitic peoples]]) in the [[first millennium BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tellier|first=Luc-Normand|title=Urban World History: An Economic and Geographical Perspective|year=2009|publisher=PUQ|page=301|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=PA301|isbn=9782760522091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the 20th century==
This theory of a Phoenician discovery of the Americas was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{citation needed|reason=No documentation proving so|date=November 2014}} In the late 18th century, a number of people speculated on the origins of the [[petroglyphs]] on [[Dighton Rock]]. [[Ezra Stiles]], then President of [[Yale College]], believed them to be Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Frank Edward|last2=Manuel|first2=Fritzie Prigohzy|title=James Bowdoin And The Patriot Philosophers|year=2003|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|pages=197–198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZaY5Vxx0qIC&amp;pg=PA197|isbn=9780871692474}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Court de Gébelin]], who initiated the modern usage of the [[Tarot]], argued in ''Le Monde primitif'' that they commemorated an ancient visit to the Massachusetts shore by a group of sailors from [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Southwick|first=Albert B.|title=Mystery of Dighton Rock|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130110/NEWS/101109827/1020|accessdate=29 January 2013|newspaper=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, belief in an [[House of Joseph (LDS Church)|Israelite visit to the Americas]] became a part of [[Mormonism]]. [[Ross T. Christensen]] has propounded the theory that the [[Mulekites]] in the [[Book of Mormon]] were "largely Phoenician in their ethnic origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christensen|first=Ross T|author-link=Ross T. Christensen|title=The Phoenicians and the Ancient Civilizations of America|url=http://www.ancientamerica.org/library/media/HTML/1ofnf5kk/15.%20THE%20PHOENICIANS%20AND%20THE%20ANCIENT%20CIVILIZATIONS%20OF%20AMERICA.htm?n=0|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1871 book ''Ancient America'', [[John Denison Baldwin]] said
&lt;blockquote&gt;The known enterprise of the Phoenician race, and this ancient knowledge of America, so variously expressed, strongly encourage the hypothesis that the people called Phoenicians came to this continent, established colonies in the region where ruined cities are found, and filled it with civilized life. It is argued that they made voyages on the “great exterior ocean,” and that such navigators must have crossed the Atlantic; and it is added that symbolic devices similar to those of the Phoenicians are found in the American ruins, and that an old tradition of the native Mexicans and Central Americans described the first civilizers as “bearded white men,” who “came from the East in ships.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baldwin|first=John D|author-link=John Denison Baldwin|title=The Phoenician Theory|url=http://www.djmcadam.com/phoenician-theory.html|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1870s, a stone inscription was allegedly discovered in [[Paraíba]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;The "Paraiba inscription" made the pages of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', 10 June 1968 with commentary by [[Cyrus H. Gordon]].&lt;/ref&gt; A transcription was shown to [[Ladislau de Souza Mello Netto]], director of the [[National Museum of Brazil]]. Netto accepted the inscription as genuine, but when it was later stated to be a hoax, Netto backed down and blamed foreigners for its fabrication. In the 1960s, [[Cyrus H. Gordon]] believed the inscription to be genuine and created a translation which begins, "We are Sidonian Canaanites from the city of the Mercantile King ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cyrus H. Gordon|Gordon, Cyrus H.]], "The Canaanite Text from Brazil," ''Orientalia'', No. 37, 1968, pp. 425-436.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription's letter forms are variations that individually occurred and disappeared over a span of 800 years and so the confluence in a single piece of writing verifies the inscription as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Lemche1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemche|first=Niels Peter|title=The Israelites in History and Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIoY7PagAOAC&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=10 May 2014|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664227272|pages=181–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stiebing1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiebing|first=William H.|title=Ancient Astronauts, Cosmic Collisions and Other Popular Theories about Man's Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJZYRmCQTUEC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=10 May 2014|year=1984|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=9781615926978|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century theories==
[[File:Bat Creek Inscription 1890 Lithograph Figure 7 Inverted.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Lithograph of the [[Bat Creek inscription]], which [[Cyrus H. Gordon]] believed to be [[Paleo-Hebrew]].]]
In the 20th century, adherents have included [[Cyrus H. Gordon]], [[John Philip Cohane]], [[Ross T. Christensen]], [[Barry Fell]] and [[Mark McMenamin]]. Gordon believed that ancient Hebrew inscriptions had been found at two sites in the southeastern United States, indicating that Jews had arrived there before [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. One of these supposed finds was the [[Bat Creek inscription]], which Gordon believed to be [[Paleo-Hebrew]], but is generally thought to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ramtops.co.uk/bat1.html Robert C. Mainfort, Jr., and Mary L. Kwas, "The Bat Creek Stone: Judeans In Tennessee?" ''Tennessee Anthropologist'' Vol. XVI, No. 1, Spring 1991] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816103039/http://ramtops.co.uk/bat1.html |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another find which has been claimed as supporting the theory of Semitic discovery of the Americas is the [[Los Lunas Decalogue Stone]], which has also been dismissed as a fake.

In 1996, [[Mark McMenamin]] proposed a theory that Phoenician sailors discovered the New World c. 350 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McMenamin Offers New Evidence for Controversi al Theory|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/990108/mcman.html|publisher=College Street Journal|accessdate=29 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301003714/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/csj/990108/mcman.html|archivedate=1 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]n state of [[Carthage]] minted gold [[stater]]s in 350 BC bearing a pattern, in the reverse [[exergue]] of the coins, which McMenamin interpreted as a map of the Mediterranean with the Americas shown to the west across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark McMenamin|McMenamin, M. A.]] 1996. ''Carthaginian Cartography: A Stylized Exergue Map.'' Meanma Press, South Hadley, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark McMenamin|McMenamin, M. A.]] 1997. The Phoenician World Map. ''Mercator's World'' 2(3):46-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J. M. 2005. ''Geography in Early Judaism and Christianity.'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 182-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCaffrey|first=Kevin|title=Who Discovered the Americas?|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/offices/comm/vista/9606/4.html|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMenamin later demonstrated that putative Carthaginian coins found in America were modern forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McMenamin |title=Phoenicians, Fakes and Barry Fell: Solving the Mystery of Carthaginian Coins Found in America |date=2000 |publisher=Meanma Press |place=South Hadley, Massachusetts |isbn=1893882012}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Various theories of Phoenicians/Canaanites/Carthaginians in the New World were discussed with the evidence's being reviewed and dismissed by [[Marshall McKusick]] in ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1979;&lt;ref&gt;McCusick, "Canaanites in America" A New Scripture in Stone?" ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 42.3 (Summer 1979), pp137ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he observed "in this modern day everyone wishes to be his own authority, and the personal search for cultural alternatives seems to make every idea or theory equal in value."

==21st century theories==
[[Lucio Russo]] has speculated about a probable arrival of [[Phoenicians]] in the Americas in his philologic analyses of [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geography_(Ptolemy)|Geography]] given in [[L'America dimenticata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucio Russo |title=L'America dimenticata: I rapporti tra civiltà e un errore di Tolomeo |date=2013 |publisher=Mondadory Education s.p.a |place=Milano |isbn=8861843204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Ptolemy gives the coordinates of the [[Fortunate Isles]] but at the same time he shrinks the size of the world by one third compared to the size measured by [[Eratosthenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valerio|first=Vladimiro|title=Spunti e Osservazioni dal Libro di Lucio Russo ''L’America Dimenticata. I Rapporti tra le Civiltà e un Errore di Tolomeo''|journal=Geostorie: Bollettino e Notizario|volume=XXI|pages=75—113|url=https://www.academia.edu/7275122/Spunti_e_osservazioni_dal_libro_di_Lucio_Russo_L_America_dimenticata._I_rapporti_tra_le_civilt%C3%A0_e_un_errore_di_Tolomeo_-_Suggestions_and_comments_from_the_book_of_Lucio_Russo_L_America_dimenticata._I_rapporti_tra_le_civilt%C3%A0_e_un_errore_di_Tolomeo}}(in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russo observes that by attributing those coordinates to the [[Antilles]], the world gets back to the right size, the geographical description given by Ptolemy fits much better and certain puzzling deformations in [[Ptolemy's world map]] disappear. Russo argues that the Antilles coordinates must have been known to Ptolemy's source, which was [[Hipparchus]]. Hipparchus lived in [[Rhodes]] and may have gotten this information from Phoenicians sailors, since they had full control of the western [[Mediterranean]] in those times.

==Scholarly assessment==
Glenn Markoe says that it will "probably never be known" whether the Phoenicians ever reached the Americas. He remarks,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Proof in the form of an inscription, like the celebrated Phoenician text allegedly found in Paraíba in northern Brazil, remains unlikely. The latter, which recounts the landing of a storm-driven party from Sidon, has long been recognized as a clever forgery. If such a fateful expedition had actually occurred, the proof is more likely to be found in a handful of Phoenician pottery shards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markoe|first=Glenn|title=Phoenicians|year=2000|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smPZ-ou74EwC&amp;pg=PA13|isbn=9780520226142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ronald H. Fritze]] discusses the history of such claims from the 17th to the 20th centuries, concluding that although technically possible:

&lt;blockquote&gt;no archaeological evidence has yet been discovered to prove the contentions of Irwin, Gordon, Bailey, Fell and others. Since even the fleeting Norse presence in Vinland left definite archaeological remains at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, it seems logical that the allegedly more extensive Phoenician and Carthaginian presence would have left similar evidence. The absence of such remains is strong circumstantial evidence that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians never reached the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Fritze|Fritze, Ronald H]]. (2009).

The "'''Tudor myth'''" is the tradition in [[History of England|English history]], [[historiography]] and [[English literature|literature]] that presents the period of the 15th century, including the [[Wars of the Roses]], in [[England]] as a dark age of anarchy and bloodshed. It served the political purpose of promoting the [[Tudor period]] of the 16th century as a golden age of peace, law, order, and prosperity.

Conspicuous in this tradition of history writing and literature was the portrayal of [[Richard III of England]] (1452&amp;ndash;1485; reigned, 1483&amp;ndash;1485) as a deformed [[kyphosis|hunchback]] and murderer. One of the historians who founded this tradition was [[Thomas More]], who wrote a history of [[Richard III of England]]. [[William Shakespeare]] continued in this tradition through his history plays that covered the 15th century:  ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. This tradition dominated the writing of British/Commonwealth-American history up until the twentieth century. However, [[Horace Walpole]] and Sir [[George Buck]] contradicted this dominant school of historiography during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] historian [[Paul Murray Kendall]], author of ''Richard III'' (1956), among others, was instrumental in drawing the attention of fellow historians to the distortions of this tradition. (See also, [[historical revisionism]].)

The concept of [[Merry England]] takes the opposite view of this period. More specifically, [[Ricardian (Richard III)|Ricardian]] historians, the [[Richard III Society]] and [[The Society of Friends of King Richard III]] have striven to provide historical perspectives more favourable to [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and his achievements during his brief reign.

== Two main sources of the "Tudor myth" tradition ==
* ''The Anglica Historia'' of [[Polydore Vergil]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090226004142/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/polydore.html  Books 23–25 on Richard III.]; [http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/polverg/  Entire 1555 edition] (Henry VII's official historian). First in print in 1534.
* Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''History of King Richard III'' (1513)[http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/r3.html]. Even though this work is considered biased, modern research has shown More's facts to be accurate: More depicts Richard as spending two years in the womb and emerging with a full set of teeth.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} his source was [[John Morton (archbishop)|John Morton]], who was [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and had served as [[Bishop of Ely]] under Edward IV and Richard III.

== Further line of the tradition ==
* [[Edward Hall]]'s ''Union of the Noble and Illustre Families of Lancaster and York'' (1548), which was then in turn used as a reference by 
* [[Raphael Holinshed]] and his collaborators who wrote the ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Wales'' (2nd edition, 1587), which was Shakespeare's primary source for his history plays.
* [[William Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">[[Image:USICOMOS Exchange.png|right]]The '''US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program''' is an exchange program for young professions in [[historic preservation]] through the United States National Committee of the [[ICOMOS|International Council on Monuments and Sites]]. The aim of the program is to promote an understanding of [[international preservation]] policies, methods and techniques that lead to a continuing dialogue between countries. As of 2007, nearly 600 young preservation professionals and over 70 countries have participated in this program since its creation in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org/usicomos/International_Exchange_Program/USICOMOS_International_Exchange_Program.htm US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Overview ==
The program began with a one-time exchange between [[US/ICOMOS]] and [[ICOMOS United Kingdom]]. It since has expanded to involve between 20 and 30 young preservation professionals each year. US/ICOMOS internships are geared toward individuals who are in their last year of a relevant graduate program or have been working for 1–3 years in a professional capacity. The program is very competitive in that only 1 in 5 applicants are awarded internships in any given year.

Interns are selected on a competitive basis for participation in the US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program. Internships are approximately 12 weeks in length and are usually held during the summer (from June to August), although some internships may be held at other times of the year. US/ICOMOS hosts all U.S. and international interns for a program orientation in Washington, DC. Interns then disperse to their various host organizations where they complete a preservation-related project designed by the host organization. At the end of the summer, all interns reconvene in Washington, DC for a final farewell program.

The program is made possible through generous grants from many U.S. foundations, government agencies and individual contributors, and ICOMOS National Committees of participating countries.

== Intern Qualifications ==
Interns must be graduate students or young professionals with at minimum an undergraduate degree in a preservation-related field. Candidates are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, two letters of recommendation, a 500-word essay describing their reasons for wanting to participate in the program, and examples of their work. Participants are selected on the basis of skill, demonstrated commitment to historic preservation, previous experience and academic concentration in the field and the ability to represent their country in an exchange program. In addition, interns are chosen whose skills, training, interest and previous experience match the needs of host organizations. Applications submitted by U.S. citizens are selected for specific internships by a jury of professional members of US/ICOMOS; applications from other ICOMOS national committees are screened at the national committee level, and then forwarded to US/ICOMOS for selection and assignments. The file of the strongest candidate(s) for a particular internship is sent to the host office (in the U.S. and in participating countries) for review and final approval.

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names.

Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=We then discuss why the 56/64 year Venus cycle cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.

Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] in a 2003 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V.

Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing "clock-time errors".&lt;ref&gt;John D.
